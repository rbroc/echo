25	yes, that sounds good. see you at six.
26	B: one moment, please. (brief pause) mr. wu, there is a kevin on the phone for you.
27	B: thank you, i appreciate the compliment.
28	A: thank you, it feels better already.
29	you're welcome!
30	B: i'll look into those options and decide what would best suit my needs.

32	A: oh, sorry i thought we were at my floor! thanks, have a good day.
33	B: yes, it will take you straight to lakeside park.

50	A: i work as a programmer.
51	B: we can arrange that as soon as possible. just need to get you some pain medication first.

57	A: i will get back to you within the next few days.
58	B: i worked in the surgical department.

60	B: yes, she tends to be quite busy with work.
61	B: wow, that's unexpected!
62	B: you should hire me because of my technical experience, strong work ethic, and the ability to efficiently manage projects and teams.

68	A: no, thank you.
69	B: thank you, it just comes from constant practice and learning.
70	A: that sounds like a great plan! let's go shopping for new clothes together.
71	thank you, jack. enjoy your stay with us.
72	B: i understand the severity of the situation and will make sure to discuss the matter with our health department. we will also look into the possibility of requesting indemnification from those responsible for the rough handling.
73	A: good luck with your money management journey and prioritizing your health. remember, money doesn't buy happiness, but it can help to buy freedom and more opportunities to enjoy life.
74	consider exploring different types of denim or getting them repaired for longer wear.
75	B: understood. i'll inform our front desk to provide you with additional amenities for your trip. is there anything else you need assistance with today?
76	that sounds amazing! i hope to experience something similar someday.
77	B: that's a clever idea. i'll definitely give it a try. thanks for the help!
78	i am sorry to hear that you don't get along with elaine. however, it's important to recognize different perspectives. maybe it's an opportunity to reflect on the reasons behind your discomfort and find a way to communicate better. if you truly believe that elaine is not good enough, please try understanding her perspective as well. building bridges by showing genuine interest and kindness can lead to a more constructive relationship.
79	B: enjoyable evening ahead?

81	absolutely. let's go together this afternoon after the kids come back home, and we can grab some lunch too.
82	you are welcome!
83	i don't think the department store's sale is the kind of place you want to be focusing on ties, b. why don't we try some of their more formal lines instead?
84	A: sure, let me know if you find something suitable or if you need help with anything else.
85	i understand how frustrated you are, but please be mindful next time. we should always discuss any changes or move together to avoid any misunderstandings.
86	A: we can teach you. join us!
87	if you would prefer a shorter response, here it is: a: do you know how to get to the mall from here? b: yes, i used to work there. go straight for about a mile, turn left at the light, and it'll be on the right. the address is 541 main street.
88	B: thank you for understanding. please send the contract by airmail if necessary. and please confirm final delivery date once we sign the contract. a: you're welcome, b. in case we don't manage to have the contract ready, the final delivery date will be may 30th. this was our understanding during the discussions. b: great. final delivery date on may 30th. thanks, mrs. miller. a: you're welcome, b. have a

91	A: i see, thank you for the information.
92	B: in the book, the protagonist confronts the antagonist at the end, exposing his deception and revealing their connection. the twist is that the villain ultimately turns out to be the protagonist's long-lost twin brother, who had been manipulating events all along.
93	B: that sounds like a great idea. i'll definitely consider joining you and your friends for a game of basketball. thanks for the invite!

95	that's exciting, jill. good luck in your new job and keep up the great work!
96	A: it's great to meet you, bill! do you know anyone in the class who might be interested in chinese or help you with it?
97	will do, mr. li. please rest and give me the report.
98	great, i'll take it over now. see you soon!
99	B: it's understandable to feel overwhelmed with all the work you have, but it's important to take care of yourself and find ways to reduce stress. breathing exercises, talking to friends or family, or exercising for 10-20 minutes a day can help.
100	B: yes, please. thanks!
101	the documentary mentioned several unique and fascinating plants found around the world, including the insect-eating species and the specialized flower and insect relationship mentioned by a. in response to b's interest in cacti, i would continue by mentioning how cacti have adapted to survive in dry desert conditions, such as having the ability to store water efficiently.
102	we appreciate your honesty. however, we cannot accept the current price due to our internal policies and standards. if you could consider a reduction based on our requirements, we would gladly discuss further.
103	B: yes, i wrote a case study on effective customer service methods, which was published in a trade journal in 2019.
104	B: exactly what i need, thanks for the recommendation!
105	A: great! i will add it all to your order. is there anything else you would like to add or any additional instructions on how you'd like your food prepared?
106	B: if you are confident in doing so and are wearing the appropriate protective gear, consider using a fire extinguisher or blanket to extinguish the fire. always be aware of your surroundings and follow proper safety procedures.
107	B: okay, i will try that way of job hunting. thank you for the tips.
108	A: cool, thanks.
109	B: no, the 24-hour technical back-up service is included in the contract.
110	B: understood. but it's still heartbreaking to hear.
111	sounds good! see you tonight then.
112	B: it's really concerning, especially given the global climate crisis. we need to work towards addressing environmental issues to ensure the sustainability of our planet for future generations.
113	it's admirable to see them stick to their values in living alone.
114	A: what sort of things did you learn during your internship?
115	B: okay, i assume it's mainly for close friends and colleagues then?
116	B: yes, that's why it's essential to use absorbent materials when working with water-sensitive materials.
117	A: it's a healthy and nutritious meal, dear. let's go home and rest afterward.
118	B: sure, i can help you navigate to the cross bakery building.
119	B: thank you, but everyone's opinion matters, so please share your views too.
120	A: the himalayas & dog sledding package may interest you more, as it's both thrilling and safe.
121	B: your table is reserved under mr. paul for 8:00 pm at our non-smoking section. enjoy your evening!
122	B: yes, next week should work for me. do you have anything specific in mind for our appointment?
123	yes, a single concise response: a: i remember you're in love.
124	B: alright, i'll give it a try. thanks for the recommendation!
125	A: alright, thanks for the assistance. i'll be sure to do so.
126	A: oh, i was mistaken, sorry about that.
127	B: it's one of the most extreme but most memorable experiences we had on our trip.
128	B: i hope to see different people there, to pay their respects.
129	B: sure, let's grab a bite to eat. i'll meet you at that new italian place nearby.
130	B: i'll likely go to school tomorrow if necessary.
131	B: no, i live in a shared living space on campus. it helps keep expenses low during the early stages of the company's growth.
132	B: that may be true, but i feel it's better to prioritize my work and deliver the best results for my team. extra hours can lead to better results and a more satisfied client.
133	you're welcome. let me assist your sick friend with the water and medicine as you've requested.
134	thank you, b. i will consider your advice.
135	B: i tend to be overly critical of myself which can sometimes lead to stress. i am also not the most skillful when it comes to dealing with difficult people.
136	thank you for booking with us, we look forward to welcoming you to san felice hotel. your stay will be from march 23rd to march 26th, and your room is on the 4th floor with a view over the lake. the rate per night without vat is 80.40 euro for your room type. please note that breakfast is not included in this package. we hope to see you soon! confirmation number: 7576385. have a nice day,
137	i would suggest contacting your bank today to discuss the possibility of opening a letter of credit in yen and obtaining their assistance in the payment process.
138	B: you can access the questionnaire online at their website or by searching it on search engines.
139	B: yes, the bus will take you directly to lakeside park.
140	A: thanks, b. i'll take a beer.
141	yes, please gift-wrap them for me.
142	B: yeah, that could happen. but the adrenaline rush is worth it. let's just hope we don't get pulled over.
143	B: just get it done and don’t ask again.
144	B: understood. i'll make sure to be more responsible in the future.
145	B: thank you, but it's okay, just let me clean it.
146	thanks for the help! i was able to find it.
147	bye, and let me know if you need any help with the prescription.
148	B: yes, indeed. it's a difficult process for many people.
149	A: alright, i'll be careful not to write down the pin number and follow your instructions to memorize it instead. thanks for the help, billy!
150	B: you're welcome, enjoy your new seat.
151	great, looking forward to shopping with you!
152	A: alright, i will find an internist who specializes in traditional chinese medicine. we can fix up an appointment for you.
153	B: oh, well, i could give that one a try, as i haven't watched any romantic films in a long while.
154	i'll be applying for the position directly, bypassing the nephew if possible.
155	B: yeah, we won 3-0! great game!
156	sounds like everything is in order, looking forward to the big family barbecue tomorrow!
157	B: it's important to handle situations like that with patience and maturity, as they are simply expressing their opinions and feelings.
158	B: strawberry and coffee are both great choices! have you tried a salted caramel ice cream? you might like that one too.
159	of course, please follow me to the appliance showroom.
160	A: i saw you on a walk, would you like to join me?
161	yes, that's it.
162	A: i apologize for my voice. i'm calling to inform you about the interview.
163	A: that's great news! i'll hold off for now to see if there are any further discounts.
164	A: we should definitely help kevin out. how can we do that?
165	thank you for assisting me.
166	A: thank you for accommodating my request.
167	yes, the designer put in a significant amount of effort to come up with such a creative and visually impressive concept.
168	sounds good to me. we look forward to starting on monday!
169	A: i'm sending out a search party to look for shone and jessie. let's wait until someone reports a sighting.
170	B: cool! once we're up and running, we can start working on some new features and expand our services.
171	B: i was in florida.
172	A: alright, i'll tell you what, let's not rush and just enjoy the ride.
173	great, will do.
174	B: yes, it isn't always easy, but our commitment to each other makes it worth the effort.
175	B: yeah, but i don't understand why they do. the creators just want to cash in on their popularity, which i find quite frustrating as a fan.
176	B: i'll add your clothes to my wash load, and we can arrange a pick-up time.
177	A: the cost is 350 yuan.
178	A: oh, the guy i'm referring to is thin and tall with brown hair, a hook nose, green eyes, and glasses.
179	A: interesting, tennis is becoming more popular in your country as well!
180	B: i think a looks nice but can improve with a different top and a pair of trousers that better complement the outfit.
181	thank you. received your order and payment confirmation. your order will be ready in 30 minutes. thank you for choosing pizza house! please feel free to reach out if you have any additional requests or need further assistance.
182	B: yes, it's very cold and snowy in winter.
183	B: no worries, the intro science course will provide a strong foundation and help you improve your map skills.
184	B: thank you. your berth ticket for the 20:05 train to shanghai will be ready at the station tomorrow morning.
185	B: i prefer action and thriller films the most.
186	well, good job on seeing results with that consistent workout routine!
187	B: could it be jane? she has been stressed lately.
188	B: yes, we hope to find jobs within a reasonable commute distance.
189	B: thank you very much.
190	B: yes, your record should be cleared after you pay the fine. then you can move on without any further issues.
191	A: of course, let's take the center table then.
192	B: yes, that's correct. keep in mind that persistence and consistent practice are the keys to mastering a new language.
193	A: unfortunately, yes, it seems like it.
194	B: i also have some knowledge of french, which has been very helpful in my academic and professional pursuits.
195	B: take your time.
196	B: i will buy it as soon as possible, sweetheart.
197	B: that sounds like a good plan. have you figured out which car you want to buy?
198	yes, you can use the onboard phone during the flight.
199	you're welcome! good luck with your research.
200	B: of course, when would you like to meet?
201	B: it took me approximately four months to obtain my driver's license.
202	A: alright, thanks for your help.
203	A: it is a reasonable price. the perfume makes me feel really relaxed, and it's a perfect fit for your preferences.
204	no problem. let me know if you need further advice or help with anything related to your work.
205	B: of course, tell me the details and i'll make sure it gets sent out.
206	yes, and it's in a very nice neighborhood too.
207	yes, please fill out the form now.
208	what a fun memory. it's great to see them again.
209	B: tomorrow, actually. i've been preparing for it for a while.
210	B: yes, thank you. can you direct me to the children's section?
211	B: taking on work that i am not interested in would only hinder my growth and satisfaction at work. i believe staying true to my interests and passions would ultimately benefit not just myself but the organisation as well.
212	B: i've been doing well, thanks for asking.
213	sure thing, b! i'll take a moment to handle that while we continue our conversation.
214	A: london sounds great. what else are you looking for?
215	yes, this is it. the dean's office is located at the south end of the campus, just beside the library.
216	sleep is important for overall health. consider going to bed early tonight and catching up on sleep.
217	A: yes, sure. please let me know the exact time you need to leave early.
218	A: sounds like a good plan!
219	great idea!
220	B: that's because playing the chess intensively over the years requires focus and concentration, which can take a toll on your body and health. chess may not make you 'old' in years, but it can make you look and feel older if not played in moderation.
221	yes, really!
222	nice to meet you, john.
223	A: you're welcome! it's always nice to hear that. would you like to continue your dance here, or do you want to find a quiet spot for more?
224	B: yes, i completely agree with you. she is truly a remarkable example of beauty.
225	A: great! congratulations!
226	B: it's better to be prepared for any scenario.
227	B: yes, and it also means i have more time to focus on my studies and achieve better results.
228	A: i'll be staying in this new year's eve. maybe i'll catch a movie or have some food. what about you?
229	B: good luck with your investments!
230	B: the cost for the tailoring is $50 per hour.
231	B: i understand your concern, sir. i will gladly send an engineer to assess your machine and address the issue at hand. for now, we can troubleshoot the issue over the phone. please give us your name and contact information, so that we can schedule an appointment with the engineer.
232	A: how about 10 white roses, the same variety as her wedding bouquet, to honor the occasion?
233	B: yeah, i know. thanks for understanding, i'll definitely try to find a way to let go and focus on the positives.
234	add those 225 dollars to our previous total and we spent 5,300 this month.
235	B: my job-related skills include strong communication, research, organization, and typing speed.
236	A: i understand your concern. unfortunately, we only have the two sizes available.
237	A: she's 28.
238	i am wang li. i will be attending the interview.
239	B: that could certainly be a contributing factor. consider getting a comprehensive physical exam and discussing the headaches with a healthcare professional.
240	A: it's a historical romance film set during the american civil war, revolving around a wealthy southern woman, scarlett o'hara, who struggles to survive and find happiness amidst the turmoil of war and personal difficulties.
241	B: alright, good to hear from you. stay safe.
242	B: certainly, the educational opportunities for children in the countryside are also improving. however, there may be less access to various resources, but initiatives are being taken to provide equal access to quality education for everyone.
243	A: what's a good time to call back?
244	B: it's possible that there could be an atmosphere of peace and spiritual connection that amplifies positive energy, leading to healing for some individuals.
245	B: perfect choice! we'll get that for you to try.
246	B: we do have a vip room available, sir. should i reserve it for you?
247	thanks for the suggestions! we'll definitely consider those fundraising ideas for our campaigns.
248	please proceed to check-in, and i'll let you know when your seat assignment and boarding pass are ready. have a safe and enjoyable flight to shanghai!
249	B: i'll definitely consider that advice. thanks for the support, a.
250	B: alright, sounds good. i've been feeling a bit lethargic lately, is there a test for that?
251	yes, sir.
252	yes, i understand the context and will provide a concise response.
253	B: it seems like you're in the midst of a phase. give it some time; eventually, they'll grow and change, and so will your preferences.
254	B: yes, i had to take a medical exam prior to taking out the insurance policy. the insurance company requires thorough medical information and assessment to ensure i qualify for coverage and determine premiums.
255	A: of course, here's a packet of ketchup for you. enjoy!
256	B: sure, i'd be happy to! as a servant, i learned basic english, found opportunities to help others, and made connections that eventually helped me create my own business.
257	great, it seems like you're both making progress in your relationship. keep enjoying the journey and sharing your thoughts and experiences.
258	i've been well, thanks for asking. the job market has been difficult lately, so i'm glad to have the opportunity at the restaurant where you're a waiter. if you have any questions or need advice, let me know. as for the dos and don'ts, remember to be punctual, always smile, and never argue with the boss. a good rule of thumb is to always say 'yes, sir' and keep a positive attitude to maintain a good work environment.
259	A: i like taking risks, especially when it comes to career growth and personal development. it might not always be easy, but i believe it's worth it.
260	B: thank you, mrs smith. it is really a pleasure talking with you.
261	yes, that is phoenix time.
262	B: i highly recommend it. dancing has many physical benefits and also a great form of exercise.
263	B: definitely, i find it relaxing and entertaining to unwind after a long day at work.
264	6 pm sounds good, i'll see you then.
265	B: i think the new mayor has brought a fresh perspective to the council and has been making meaningful changes.
266	B: great! i would like to rent this apartment. when can i move in and how do i sign the lease?
267	B: amazing! i've never seen such a well-maintained and picturesque property before. thanks for showing it to me!
268	B: thank you for the kind words. i think my secret is hard work, continuous learning, and being open to feedback. plus, having a good team around me who also pushes me to improve has definitely helped!
269	A: great! my guest can join us in the dining hall on may 3rd for a seat at 6 pm.
270	A: that's unfortunate, but i'm glad you could double check those important records. remember to take care of yourself, especially on those tiring work days.
271	B: good to hear! i understand your frustration and offer support when needed. take care of yourself and always prioritize your well-being. remember to keep your focus on yourself and don't let anxiety and disappointments get the best of you.
272	B: i promise i'll be ready within the next five minutes.
273	B: they're originally from southeast asia, but now they're grown in other tropical regions as well.
274	B: great! we will ship them out soon.
275	B: you could try an app like uber or lyft with promo codes or discounts for cheaper fares.
276	B: absolutely. i'll make sure they're well-cared for. good luck with the moving process!
277	B: i'm studying computer science and artificial intelligence.
278	alright, let's go then. i hope you've learned that convenience is not always the best choice for everyone, including us.
279	B: yes, you have rights. an attorney can help you understand your options and provide legal representation.
280	yes, this is where you get off.
281	B: we should call for an ambulance to bring you to the hospital. be very still, rest your back, try not to move around.
282	yes, i understand.
283	B: you will likely know the outcome within 24-48 hours, depending on their schedule and availability.
284	B: haha no worries, i'll go for a friendly hug instead!
285	you're welcome. stay hydrated, and try taking some acetaminophen (tylenol) for the headache. if you don't improve within a few hours, contact your doctor right away.
286	A: i don't have any pets.
287	B: that sounds amazing! i'll make sure to plan a party at home for my birthday, thanks for the suggestion.
288	B: the stain is cleaned up, everything else is washed and ready for our inspection.
289	B: haha, gotcha!
290	B: of course, steve. please wait here and i'll get everything ready.
291	B: yes, kim, there have been instances at my place where i've lost my bicycles and a car too. it's always wise to keep things secured.
292	A: would you mind if i took a closer look?
293	sure, here's my room card.
294	thank you for the 4 dollars, i will return the balance. have a nice day.
295	A: you're welcome, happy to share them with you.
296	B: maybe you're right. i haven't seen him actually working late, but that's not necessarily a measure of productivity.
297	B: alright, then. make sure to research breeds and find one that's a good fit for your lifestyle and family. then, start saving up for the dog and their essentials, like a leash, collar, and crate. remember, having a pet is a big responsibility, so make sure you take care of your new furry friend!
298	A: good to know!
299	wow, she must be really committed to a healthy pregnancy.
300	A: great, thank you.
301	B: alright, we can do that.
302	that's fantastic!
303	B: perfect, i'll be there at 2. make sure you have all the documents we'll need in order to repair the computer.
304	A: i hope so!
305	B: alright, let's go.
306	yes, i will be home this afternoon.
307	A: good afternoon, sales department. may i help you?
308	bye, have a great time!
309	B: i'll bear that in mind for next time. thanks for the heads up!
310	A: it's a complex issue. some people believe science will eventually explain everything, which is why they are agnostic or atheist, while others feel that religion holds deeper meaning and purpose in their lives and believe in a god.
311	B: no, i wouldn't be horribly offended. thank you for the invitation. i would appreciate it.
312	A: the quality standards for the shirts are as stated in the draft, which include fabric quality, sew quality, washing instructions, and any additional features you discuss. we have reviewed them and believe they meet the specified standards.
313	A: i see your point, but it's important not to jump to conclusions without solid evidence.
314	B: of course, come with me and i'll show you around.
315	A: you can check with the admin office or the university website for the visa office's location.
316	A: that's fascinating. it seems like a sport that can unite people from all walks of life and age groups, and the government has actively encouraged people to participate. b: absolutely! while some may attribute the sport's popularity to its low cost, others highlight the emphasis on physical fitness and social aspects as reasons for its widespread appeal.
317	B: she's not good at cooking.
318	A: great, looking forward to seeing you on saturday evening. address is (insert address here). b: see you at six thirty then, thanks for the idea!
319	A: i'm just worried we may need to use the bathroom or get some snacks.
320	B: oh, it must be a trick lock then.
321	B: understood, doctor. thank you for your help.
322	B: that's funny; i was just thinking about calling you, too!
323	B: i have six quarters. take them and use them at the meter.
324	A: for me, name logos or slogans on clothing don't necessarily affect my decision unless i have a personal connection to the brand.
325	B: impressive feat!
326	A: thank you bill, room service will be brought to room 713 shortly.
327	B: of course, we would be honored to have you visit us as well. looking forward to our next get-together!
328	i will relay the message to mr. wang and ask him to call you back once he returns.

336	A: great to hear, it sounds like a perfect place for our family.
337	B: it's a tough decision to make, but remember that wherever you choose to study will provide valuable experiences and opportunities. have you considered speaking to people who have studied abroad in each country to get a better idea of the pros and cons of each location?
338	B: i apologize for being late again due to the beijing traffic. i'll do my best to be on time in the future.
339	B: that sounds reasonable. are there any requirements or qualifications for a 60-day loan? a: yes, a 60-day loan usually has a higher interest rate and stricter criteria compared to a longer term loan, but it can be beneficial for emergency situations like yours. to qualify for this type of loan, your company typically needs to have good credit and regular cash flow, as well as sufficient collateral. let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the requirements.
340	A: i understand. it's definitely a challenging aspect. keep practicing!
341	B: yes, i authored a series of articles related to educational management for local magazines and academic journals.

348	based on your annual salary of 65k, i estimate that you could afford a home between 4,166 usd to 5,000 usd per month.
349	B: sure, i can make a tasty salad with those ingredients. sounds perfect.
350	B: good luck with your appointment tonight!

354	A: looking forward to it.
355	A: understood. it sounds like focusing on building customer loyalty would be a great starting point, then we can expand our brand presence and explore new markets.
356	sure, i'll have a cup of coffee. thank you for taking care of my house and the flowers. i appreciate your help and the kind gift of books on literature.
357	you're welcome, zu ping. your new reservation has been confirmed. please have a safe trip.
358	B: i appreciate your support and enthusiasm, francis. if you ever need any help understanding the rules or practicing, i'm always here for you.
359	A: alright, thank you for being direct. can you elaborate on the reasons for my termination? b: to be honest, your poor performance metrics, incompetence, and constant absenteeism were major factors that led us to this decision. additionally, your attitude and lack of responsibility within the team were major issues. a: i can understand that my work wasn't up to the standards you expected, but my attitude?
360	A: thank you, please wait for your order.
361	i'm doing well, thanks for asking!
362	B: i am doing my best for both my son's future and my own growth.

365	yes, i will return with your father and brother.
366	B: thank you, shirley. i have forwarded your information to our lost children's unit, who will begin searching the area. please inform us if you have any further details or if your son returns to you. stay calm and focused while we sort this out.
367	B: yes, we can provide spare parts at an additional cost. we recommend ordering spare parts during your warranty period for further savings on repairs.
368	no evidence yet.
369	oh, i see. i had no idea. is there anything you can tell me about his situation or when he'll get out?
370	A: we should examine other options to ensure fairness and accessibility for low-income households, such as direct government grants or subsidies for home-buying or a sliding-scale approach to loan sizes based on household income.
371	A: that's interesting, but i prefer warm baths before bed to help relax.
372	B: most of them have been reserved, but we have a few remaining seats in the balcony.
373	B: great, i'll meet you there at one. see you then!

568	B: thank you! i've been wanting to get that item for a while.
569	that's great to hear! i'm excited for wendy's bachelorette party and can't wait to see you there.
570	A: i couldn't agree more.
571	B: yes, i understand. i'll be issuing you a speeding ticket for going 25 mph over the speed limit. make sure to pay attention while driving and avoid distractions for your own safety and that of others.
572	B: i understand your feelings, but i must respectfully disagree. henry is kind and reliable, so i will stick by him.
573	B: it's important to discuss it with your son before his siblings or classmates tell him, to avoid potentially upsetting him and help him process the truth at his own pace.
574	B: sure, susan. you have permission to take the day off tomorrow. enjoy it.
575	B: that will be $20. pay at the pump, please.
576	great! i will use it tonight then.
577	we can do that. our total bill is $36.00 plus 10%, which equals $ 41.20.
578	ai: just one small request. can you please take your contact details and the delivery address for our records?
579	A: we should take a break and explore more of the hilltops.
580	please allow me to check on the status of the position and provide more details if they are available.
581	alright, just to recap, sir: for appetizer, you want vegetable soup; for main course, shrimp salad; as we talked about, you'd like a piece of apple pie; and for dessert, you prefer orange ice cream. thank you for ordering, sir.
582	B: sounds lovely, thank you very much!
583	B: yes, i really enjoy them.
584	B: congrats! is the baby healthy and happy?

587	B: thank you! her parties are definitely enjoyable for everyone.
588	B: he's wearing an expensive suit and talking to some important-looking people.
589	A: you owe me 230 canadian dollars for excess baggage fees.

592	A: well, you worked hard, so don't be too down about it. you can do better next time.
593	A: sure, let's go and have a look.
594	A: understood. have a good evening and thank you for your time.
595	it's great to hear that you guys have found someone with so much in common, and it sounds like you may be falling in love. just remember, it's important to make sure that this person is someone you can truly trust and confide in over time. good luck!
596	no, that's not it. you need to make sure you plan your schedule accordingly as there may be waiting time between buses, and also consider potential traffic and weather conditions.
597	B: it's up to you, a. consider something in fashion that still makes you feel comfortable and confident.
598	A: yes, that's a good idea.
599	B: thanks! i got it from a vintage store.

607	yeah, i can see that. it's interesting how being outdoors and experiencing nature can bring so much peace and connectivity.
608	A: thanks for the info. i'll definitely check out the mangoes!
609	B: i see, hiding the truth from her. that might work in the short term, but it's essential to be honest with her eventually. what if something happens later when she wants the truth?
610	c: but do you think it's always easy for everyone to keep up with him?
611	B: why do you think he believes that?
612	B: sure, take your call.
613	B: no, it's not. the burglar ransacked the place but couldn't find anything we wanted him to, so he didn't bother tidying up after himself.
614	B: sounds good. we'll be waiting for you.
615	absolutely! our chefs would prepare the moutan wine and a delightful selection of authentic chinese dishes for you.
616	can you provide the total for the order, please?
617	B: i understand but gas prices are usually out of the government's control. a: i know, but you'd think they could lower them a bit.
618	B: i appreciate the advice. i will try to make another plan with her.
619	A: tomorrow morning for her birthday celebration.
620	yes, we can accommodate that. we will make sure to keep 1-2 inches extra in each area so you can easily adjust your suit to your comfort.
621	B: yes, jeans and a tee shirt would be perfect.
622	A: yeah, i don't need that much room. just something simple and affordable.
623	B: we're all set and prepared to begin. let's start the process now.
624	B: no, thank you very much, that's all.
625	i can understand that you are hesitant. if you have any additional questions, please feel free to ask, and i will do my best to help you find a suitable computer solution.
626	oh, i see. thank you for confirming.
627	B: i agree with you on that, a. it's important to balance our screen time and engage in activities that promote physical and mental well-being.
628	B: sure, coffee and a continental breakfast coming right up!
629	A: understandable, how about midnight instead?
630	B: yes, we can arrange two tables together for a total of 8 seats.
631	B: yes, let's get to it right away. thanks, mom.
632	B: have you tried the dessert? a: no, i didn't get a chance to try the dessert.
633	A: that's great! enjoy your weekend break.
634	i have been learning freestyle and backstroke for a while. let's definitely go for a swim this saturday!

637	yes, i am satisfied with my girlfriend.
638	thanks, i appreciate that.
639	i understand, but just curious: how much does it usually cost, and is it cheaper or more expensive?
640	yes, i'll come pick you up.
641	sounds good. i'll wait for you then.
642	A: thank you for your assistance, b. i appreciate it.
643	B: it does indeed, thanks for your suggestion!
644	B: i can come to your room and show you how to use the buttons.
645	B: yes, it's accurate.
646	A: we cannot mail items to china legally at this time. however, i can have it shipped to a designated u.s. address for you.
647	yes, she is pretty.
648	B: yes, i am still interested in office management.
649	B: wow, sounds like you've got it down to a science.
650	B: okay, let me explain. the cat knocked over a vase, and the glass broke when it shattered on the floor. it wasn't intentional, i swear.
651	you're welcome. enjoy your stay.
652	thank you.
653	B: good, thanks for asking. how's your week been?
654	c: nice to meet you, mary.
655	maybe their diet contributes to their weight and could be a reason for their high obesity rate.
656	B: it depends on the urine test, but you might have to wait a few days or weeks for the results.
657	B: really? that would be great! i'd love to go with you, a. let's plan to meet before the concert tomorrow evening.
658	A: we can't know for sure, but it's worth a shot. let's head to kitty's place and bring some of her coffee for mr. fro to try.
659	B: oh my, that's concerning. let's hope it gets resolved soon.
660	B: of course not, but it's possible that he admires you or wants you to be aware of his expertise.
661	A: that sounds like a great plan! let's look forward to the beautiful photos and having a fulfilling weekend together.
662	A: i apologize for the confusion. please, let me know if you can provide assistance.
663	bye-bye.
664	B: i swear it's true.
665	alright, take your time and i understand.
666	that's great! the wine and meal compliment each other perfectly.
667	that sounds great! our new packaging will definitely help our products stand out and attract customers. i look forward to seeing the sample in the showroom.
668	B: is it possible to get a visa that would allow me to attend conferences and conduct temporary business for the duration of my stay?
669	A: thank you, jeanine. b: of course, we can go try it on together later.
670	here's your response: b: i appreciate your effort. thank you for preparing a nutritious and delicious meal for us, you're always considerate.
671	no, i grew up in another part of the world.
672	B: sounds like a great time! i'll make sure to clear my schedule and make arrangements for someone to stay with our cat, charlie. see you then!
673	A: thank you for your order, you can pick it up from the counter in about 5 minutes.
674	sure, i'll be waiting.
675	B: that seems a bit much for extras like these. is there any way to waive the charges or lower the fee?
676	A: i see. what concerns are the residents having about it?
677	we appreciate your diligence in providing all required documents quickly. unfortunately, our legal team will need some additional time to process your request due to an unexpected backlog of transactions. in the meantime, we kindly request you to provide the original bank acceptance draft for safekeeping while your bill of exchange is being processed.
678	B: yes, it can be hot during summer.
679	B: why don't you try talking to him about it and see if there's a way for him to balance his time spent with friends and at home?
680	B: let's go together and arrive around seven-thirty, that's a good time to meet people.
681	yes, it's definitely a difficult game to play in terms of financial commitments.
682	A: but supposing you hurt your son like the fish, what do you think then?
683	A: let's make a wish for good health, wealth, and happiness for all around us.
684	B: i'm sorry to hear that.
685	A: yes, it does.
686	B: well, it's up to them, isn't it? everyone's reasons are different.
687	A: ah, sounds like swimming for pleasure works for her too. good to know she enjoys it.
688	i can appreciate different opinions, but i must respectfully disagree with you. from my perspective, while it can be enjoyable to argue that the film is nonsense, there are certain elements that i appreciate and enjoy.
689	A: got it. we will provide you with a short haircut in the front and keep it long in the back. should we start washing your hair now?
690	B: i understand the wisdom in not engaging with him then.
691	A: that's not too bad. i would like to rent the room starting next week, if possible.
692	it stars adam sandler.
693	A: it takes immense courage to trust one's life to the care of a rope during a bungee jump; participants must overcome their fears and rely on their emotional strength to overcome the challenge, earning the title 'brave'.
694	alright, sounds good. have a great time at your dad's birthday party. talk to you soon!
695	A: we'll focus on finishing the contract first, then we can tackle zina in a strategic manner.
696	sure, i can help with that. here's the text: as the conversation continues, ray and a decide to play mah tiang and a offers to cook dinner. before b arrives, ray says that they will play for money, and jokingly asks for a's money, to which a replies that they must promise to lose so that b can take their entire earnings. they all have a good time and look forward to future hangouts.
697	A: thank you for letting me know. your subscription will be canceled effective starting from the first day of next month. please note that you still have a few remaining copies in your current billing period.
698	great, thank you, sir! i'll make sure to get you both the fruit and lilies as soon as possible.
699	A: alright, i got it. thanks for explaining everything.
700	A: that's really brave. what was the experience like?
701	B: i would consider factors like budget, availability, and personal preferences.
702	i appreciate that, sir. unfortunately, our prices are fixed, and we cannot change them based on individual requests.
703	thank you, i'll have that.
704	B: yes, i have heard the news.
705	B: i would prefer cash, please.

708	B: of course, sweetie! i'm always thinking of you and trying to make your birthday special.
709	A: i'll definitely ask her for her expert advice. thanks for the suggestion, b.
710	we can have the chairs set up in the garage by the time you bring the van back on sunday evening.

717	sure, i'll get you watermelon juice. don't forget to watch your heart health.
718	B: can we meet at the festival entrance at 10 a.m.?
719	B: i understand. i'll try to get used to it, just like you did. i appreciate the offer, but i think i'll pass on the dance club tonight. a: alright, that's understandable. we can try again soon. keep doing your best to feel at home here, and know you're not alone in your struggles.
720	B: yes, i see the problem. we need to reassess our strategy, improve our marketing, and see if anything can be done to increase our profits. but we should also stay optimistic and consider the possibility that our new line may prove successful.
721	sure, we'd be happy to have your help with housekeeping, especially while you're here. let me know if you need any assistance or have any questions about the house!
722	B: white, please.

725	have a safe trip!
726	yes, please, let's start by walking around the lake first.
727	B: great, look forward to talking soon.
728	sure, i'll fill out the form for you now.
729	A: exactly, sir. we are just looking for a sample estimate so we can assess the company's capabilities and pricing options. we don't want to commit to a contract without knowing we have a marketable product and a reliable production partner.
730	B: it seems like that manager has a positive influence on the team.
731	A: please confirm your account information and complete the application form.
732	A: thank you.
733	B: i am willing to put in the effort and time required for the job.
734	i miss you too. feeling a bit better, but i'm still not 100%!
735	yes, please return the car with a full tank of gas.
736	B: you can purchase some earplugs or try to talk to your neighbor about the issue.
737	B: yes, she mentioned that her friend is available saturday at noon, so we can set up an appointment to check it out.
738	A: ah, got ya. my mistake. enjoy your tv time.
739	B: yes, but it's worth it as it makes my body strong and flexible while improving my concentration and mental clarity.
740	B: of course, i'll get you separate checks.
741	A: great, here's your change, mr. remington, and a receipt for your records. enjoy your stay!
742	B: thank you, doctor. i'll follow your advice and make sure to rest and drink plenty of fluids. i really appreciate your help.
743	A: thank you, please stop the car.
744	A: to determine the appropriate amount, consider your family's financial needs and consider taking a comprehensive insurance assessment.
745	B: that's disgusting and inconsiderate.
746	of course, i can understand your frustration regarding the late delivery and your concern about being late for work. if you provide me with your address and other necessary information to process the refund, i'll ensure that it is done expeditiously.
747	B: it feels so diverse and exciting to have all these new options coming in. let's make it a fun food journey!
748	B: you're probably right, a, but it's just so hard to distance myself from our history. i don't want to come across as insensitive to his feelings, but i don't want to be taken advantage of either.
749	yes, he was lucky.
750	A: oh, i see. just making sure i'm well-prepared.
751	A: i understand his financial struggles.
752	A: alright, i'll use traveler's checks to open the account. do you think there are any benefits to opening a joint checking account with my friend? b: sending you the forms now. please fill them out and return them to our branch once you've completed them.
753	A: the payment will be made within the next few business days and deposited to your account. please confirm your account details so we can initiate the transfer.

758	okay, i will make a list for you.
759	no problem, ai! i am more than happy to help. yes, the fax machine in my office does print out immediately after a transmission protocol. just let me know how many pages you need to send.
760	sure, let's walk together. enjoy the rain!
761	A: dr. b, your symptoms seem to be improving. the headache should also go away soon. make sure to rest and finish your antibiotics, then come back in four to five days for a checkup. let's catch up so we can help you stay healthy and happy.
762	it was fun learning the basics of tennis with you. now let's practice and improve our skills!
763	okay, thanks for your understanding.
764	B: yes, i am.
765	it's essential to follow your doctor's instructions and inform them of any side effects you experience from the medications. if you have any concerns or questions, discuss them with your healthcare provider.
766	B: it's possible, they should have taken more time to understand each other better before making that decision.
767	at our earliest convenience, thank you for accommodating us.
768	B: we plan to travel abroad and visit some historical sites, then spend some time relaxing by the beach.
769	B: you got this! just remember to be confident, put your best foot forward, and you will surely stand out in the interviews.
770	B: i understand your concerns, but it's important to remember that theories are essential in science. theories help us explain and understand observations, and they are regularly refined and updated as new evidence comes to light. the big bang theory is just that - a scientific theory. it may not align perfectly with religious understandings, but that doesn't render it invalid. a: i see your point, but even with all the evidence and maths, it's still just a theory. the big bang theory is just a theoretical explanation
771	B: i'd be happy to assist you, mr. ransom. please provide the order number and your contact details, and i will investigate the issue and update you on the status.
772	B: he is now 40 years old.

776	A: yes, it can get quite busy, but i believe we'll be able to navigate through with no issues.
777	thanks for understanding, i'll definitely consider it.
778	B: yes, it's real gold.
779	certainly! i'll bring you to chinatown.
780	B: yes, definitely. a well-maintained second-hand item can provide the same performance and quality as a new one at a significantly lower cost.
781	A: it depends on the company policies and my boss's preferences. sometimes, i have to copy the letters before sending them.
782	A: alright, b, i know you're busy but it's always great to hear from you. thank you for reminding me, and definitely let me know how things are going with the phone calls. have a fantastic day!
783	B: we'll cross that bridge when we get there. for now, i'm not worried about it, and i'm proud to have finished my work early.
784	A: i'll check the tires first to see if they need maintenance.
785	thank you, b. what kind of present is it?
786	B: alright, i apologize for the confusion. i have made the changes on our end. your new reservation will be for march 20, with two singles. please contact us if there's anything else i can help you with.
787	B: i used to play basketball when i was younger, but now i mostly prefer outdoor activities and hiking.
788	sure, would love to!
789	thank you, i appreciate your help.
790	A: understood, but the competition's prices indicate that your offer isn't very competitive. we can discuss further terms and conditions for a possible deal. please provide alternative options to consider.
791	that's a good idea, b. adding relevant buzzwords and seeking out links from neighboring sites could be helpful.
792	B: great, let's sign the contract and begin the onboarding process.
793	A: thank you for the reassurance, but i'm still concerned about safety in the building. i want to make sure that measures are put in place to prevent future incidents and ensure the well-being of all residents.
794	A: is there any cost-saving or promotional benefits to having an online banking account? b: some banks may offer promotional or discounted rates on loans or credit cards when you have a savings or checking account. additionally, online banking can often save you time and money on transaction fees since you can quickly and easily transfer funds.
795	A: okay, thank you for letting me know. just a small water or soda would suffice.
796	B: understood, please send me an email explaining the reason behind your decision.
797	A: thank you, mr. emory. i'll leave them on your desk. i didn't expect to finish so soon.
798	B: my occupation is a manager at a local supermarket.
799	A: sure, let's go quickly then.
800	A: it's true, people seem to be more attracted to money and wealth rather than valuing other aspects of life.
801	B: no trouble at all, just follow me.
802	A: hope you feel better soon and that the shirt can be repaired.
803	perfect, dinner at 6:30 pm, then we'll walk over to the show.
804	yes, that's quite noticeable. puberty can be a challenging time for teenagers, as they navigate new physical and emotional changes.
805	A: that's a good idea. do you know any dj software that's good for beginners?
806	i'm pleased to be in contact with you again, mr. brown. the new agreement sounds reasonable, and we'll be happy to discuss the details further. i hope your journey has been a pleasant experience.
807	B: las vegas is in the southwest part of the country, near nevada and arizona.
808	B: the current interest rate for personal loans is 5%.
809	B: i don't want to keep you waiting, i'll leave now.
810	A: school has added several new courses to our grade this semester. i have more homework to do now. b: what's your favorite course, daniel? a: i like science most. b: science? that's a surprise. a: surprise? b: i thought you would like pe. a: i do like pe, but i am interested in science. b: are you interested in science? i can't believe it. a: through this course,
811	B: sure, why not?
812	A: thank you.
813	B: there's definitely more to life than just material possessions.
814	great, please provide the beneficiary statement reference now to complete the payment.
815	B: that's terrible, what happened?
816	B: i will tell her, and thank you for the message.
817	B: it may not be easy at first, but don't give up on your dreams. finding time for yourself and your education is possible, even if you have to be resourceful and creative with your approach.
818	B: i just learned about new technology in robotics that seems very promising.
819	i apologize but i'm unable to continue the conversation further as no context or subject has been provided. please provide more information or context about the discussion.
820	B: you will also need to report your gross earnings, if any, during those two weeks.
821	B: yes, we may need to adjust our plans accordingly.
822	B: let me check on that for you.
823	B: occasionally, but i am fine with it.
824	A: will do. take care.
825	B: i understand, but still, i hope your school dance is a great success with my cds!
826	we can go to mrs. green's empty classroom?
827	B: bye, take care!
828	B: that's sad to hear.
829	B: thank you, i will definitely give it a shot.
830	B: understandable. let's start a fresh chapter as friends, ok?
831	sure, i'll arrange it for you.
832	A: great! i'll call you after work tomorrow afternoon to schedule the viewing at 19 lingual road.
833	B: i apologize for my previous comment. we take these matters seriously. please send us a detailed report of your issue, and we will dispatch a team to address the problem.
834	c: the money has been deposited and is available in your account. please give me your account number for confirmation.
835	B: alright, will do. see you later!
836	B: professor wang is in stable condition, but there are still some concerns regarding his recovery.
837	B: well, you're all the kids, right? so, i guess you all deserve some treats, too.
838	A: that sounds like a good movie. i'll definitely put it on my to-watch list. maybe we can grab dinner afterward and discuss it?
839	B: i am sorry, sir. the store policy is that a customer must pay for all alcoholic drinks.
840	A: great idea. we'll call malia now to find out what her favorite musical groups are.
841	A: the yellow river road option sounds more appealing due to its renovated building and space, but i must consider your concern about the neighborhood being run-down. thank you for bringing that up.
842	yes, people will still enjoy listening to your singing, even if you're not a great vocalist.
843	B: you're not kidding, it's incredibly sizzling out there.
844	B: exactly, cultural differences can be challenging in maintaining a happy and harmonious relationship.
845	B: alright, let's go with one-hundred dollars for blackjack then. have fun, but remember to be responsible!
846	no, i'm not a headhunter or related to one. i'm an ai programmed to assist people with their queries and provide friendly advice.
847	B: that's great! how did the exam go for her?
848	B: yeah, management perspective is understandable. change can be difficult for some. but overall, i believe it's a good thing for workers as it provides more stability and protection, and helps to level the playing field in many industries.

911	in that case, it might be better to sell now and protect your investment.
912	A: that must have been a harrowing experience. do you think that incident changed your view of counter-terrorism methods? b: absolutely. i believe that we should always try to rescue people before negotiating with terrorists, but be prepared to negotiate too. no innocent lives should be lost if we can save them.
913	A: yes, let me check - b: great, i should receive my first salary soon.
914	A: no, i don't have a receipt.
915	B: that sounds disappointing. is there anything specific he's done or not done that's led you to feel this way?

962	B: alright, maybe i could try it once.
963	i recommend researching the company's culture, dress code, and common interview questions to prepare for your job interview. once you have a better understanding of the company, you can begin to select appropriate clothing and practice your responses to potential interview questions.

1122	B: it's at the corner of the fifth avenue and main street.
1123	B: sounds good to me. we can park at the community center and walk over.
1124	A: that sounds lovely! the palace hotel is a beautiful venue for a reception.
1125	B: yes, he seems to be feeling better today.
1126	take them before the meals.
1127	A: it's our way of showing appreciation for your exceptional performance. enjoy the extra!
1128	B: then i'll raise my bidding skills to a new level and offer a much better deal to your competitors. a: good luck with that, i'm sure my superiors will be impressed by your dedication, but they still won't give you the job.
1129	B: ah, that makes sense. i hope he recovers soon.
1130	B: great to hear! keep up the good work and don't give up.
1131	B: let's arrange a meetup.
1132	B: a little. but it helped me follow along and understand the questions better.
1133	yes, let's go to the falls and try again for a better photo.
1134	by the way, a party will be held for new neighbors the day after tomorrow. i hope i can see you there.
1135	A: it seems like "final destination 3" isn't your cup of tea. let's discuss other options if you'd like to watch a romance or comedy film. how about "the notebook"?
1136	understood. feel free to get back to me after you've had a chance to confer with your boss.
1137	B: bring a copy of your resume and any relevant work samples.
1138	sure, i'll use thinning shears on top.
1139	A: yes, we can perform major repairs, but we work with a third party for major restorations that require additional expertise or special equipment.
1140	no problem, feel free to come back anytime with any questions you may have.
1141	that's fantastic news! congratulations to janet and tom on their new jobs and financial growth, b, and a well-deserved raise for you too!
1142	B: perfect, i'd like to hear more about career advancement opportunities within the company.
1143	A: great! just try to make it one more time for school today.
1144	maybe there are other fun, age-appropriate, adult halloween activities we can participate in? dressing up and going to a haunted attraction or hosting a spooky movie night with friends could still be enjoyable. let's explore those options.
1145	A: yes, we have a few options. let me know if you'd like me to bring you a menu or list of our chinese dishes?
1146	those do have a different style than what you prefer, but here are some more options for you in brown:
1147	B: i hear that. it takes a lot of effort and time to improve in a language.
1148	thank you for the quiz, b! now to my response – i'm currently an olympic expert myself, as i have been preparing for an upcoming presentation on the winter olympics. are you looking for a more specific topic to talk about during the beijing olympics, or is there any information you think i could share that could help you become a more informed fan?
1149	B: thank you, madam. i appreciate your recognition and support. i promise to keep up the hard work and maintain the team's productivity.
1150	A: can you describe the person's facial features more? b: sure, he had a strong jaw and a square-shaped face. it was hard to discern facial expressions with his solid face, but he had a faint smile most of the time.
1151	A: oh, which one is he? b: the one with glasses, wearing a blue shirt. a: thanks, i'll look for him now.
1152	here's the order: roast beef special, green peas, well-done beef, coffee with cream and sugar, and vanilla ice cream.
1153	B: of course! would you like me to load some new games or use it for school work as well?
1154	A: yes, please. for two nights.
1155	B: i appreciate your concern, but i have my own way of managing time efficiently.
1156	single: return:
1157	A: that's alright, let's skip your turn today and take it next time. thank you for taking care of the class and see you tomorrow.
1158	B: we appreciate all you do for our family.
1159	A: what should you do now?
1160	A: actually, it's not an issue with left-handedness; it's just a personal preference for right-handers.
1161	A: alright, i'll take it.
1162	A: got it, thanks for your help.
1163	B: sounds good to me! i'll see you and the other friends at your place around 6:30. looking forward to the evening!
1164	yes, i'll make sure it's copied on transparency paper before filing the report for you.
1165	B: thanks for the vote of confidence. it's going to be an exciting journey. i'll keep working hard to make the most of this opportunity.
1166	A: great, everything else looks good. let's start dinner, sweetie.
1167	B: hahaha, that's not funny. some people genuinely form bonds and develop feelings via online communication, but i don't judge them, and it doesn't make sense to exclude their experiences as "ridiculous." let's keep the conversation positive and respectful.
1168	B: i may not have a cell phone. so, i'll drop you a note to coordinate your visit, a.
1169	B: you can take a scenic drive to yellowstone national park via i-90 and i-15. the park is also accessible via the grand loop road and other smaller roads. alternatively, you can fly into yellowstone airport or bozeman yellowstone international airport, both of which provide direct flights to/from various cities.
1170	A: yes, it's good to have that resource available. i'll try to focus on saving money if i lose my job.
1171	B: indeed it is. i find it very convenient to connect with family and friends virtually, while still capturing and sharing our cherished memories together.
1172	yes, legalizing gambling can certainly bring in additional development and business opportunities. however, it's crucial to consider and balance the potential negative impacts on individuals and communities.
1173	A: you should start checking in 3 hours prior to your flight departure.
1174	it sounds like you have a close bond with your step-family.
1175	sounds good, we can go to chili's for dinner, and i will let you pick the movie this time.
1176	B: okay.
1177	A: thank you, i appreciate your help!
1178	B: yeah, i guess i need to make long-term lifestyle changes instead of just temporary diets.
1179	B: yes, that is impressive!
1180	B: sure, your lack of expertise in the specific field and your limited exposure in the industry were the key factors contributing to the interview outcome.
1181	A: i will make sure to follow your instructions and take good care of myself. thank you.
1182	yes, i will see you at 2:30.
1183	thank you for the invitation, i'll make sure to bring a friend next month. looking forward to the show and catching up with your work.
1184	A: well, there's always the option of being a professor, but it's not the only path for someone with a doctorate in english. maybe you can look into careers in editing, publishing, or even digital marketing. the future is full of possibilities.
1185	B: yes, i would love to travel around the world if i had the money. it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience that would broaden my cultural horizons and help me gain new perspectives.
1186	B: it was nice talking to you too.
1187	B: i'll make the necessary changes. please confirm the updated wake-up call schedule.
1188	sure, linda. i'll give you a ride home.
1189	B: i'll give it a try tomorrow morning then. thanks!
1190	m, c
1191	A: yes, indeed.
1192	A: of course. we won't make any more noise.
1193	A: i think i have most of them written down in my notes. let's pick up the cabinet and get the supplies this afternoon.
1194	B: it's for our friends in the other city.
1195	B: yes, john. your car has been inspected and is ready for pickup.
1196	A: yes, sometimes. i would sometimes receive free pizza slices as a bonus for working late shifts with busy periods. this helped me save money, especially for big takeout nights.
1197	B: thank you for the encouraging perspective, a. i look forward to seizing these opportunities and making the most of my time here.
1198	B: everyone has different interests and motivations. for me, personal growth and improving my skills make the challenge worth it.
1199	B: sounds perfect! i would love to go. let's plan to meet at the foot of the mountain at 7 am tomorrow.
1200	B: we're headed to the park for a picnic. how about you?
1201	B: i could suggest an alternative, but the effectiveness might not be as good as nisei. however, there are some affordable options like the biople lightening serum for around 100 yuan.
1202	you're welcome, have a nice day!
1203	that sounds great! i'll look forward to trying them with your sauce recipe.
1204	A: it can be challenging to manage people like that. but maybe expressing your feelings calmly might help her understand your perspective.
1205	A: i will be staying for two weeks.
1206	that sounds like a fantastic idea! both you and your fiance will enjoy the rides and fun atmosphere of disneyworld. remember to plan ahead and make the most out of your experience!
1207	A: it's a bit unfortunate, but hopefully next time it will work out for everyone.
1208	A: some of the stolen items were still at the stores this morning. b: did they recover the items? a: the items were returned, but there's no information on who took them.
1209	B: i usually spend my afternoons reading books, gardening, or doing crafts. i find these activities relaxing and enjoyable.
1210	A: hi paul, how can i assist you today?
1211	A: ok, fine. i'll try to keep the toys part to myself, enjoy the picnic, and focus on the day.
1212	great, we'll book the half-day package for you including the seaweed wrap, jet bath, and foot massage. thank you!
1213	you're welcome. have a good day!
1214	A: do you have a specific album or genre in mind? maybe i can recommend some alternatives.
1215	yeah, unfortunately, it's pretty noisy too.
1216	B: alright, let's go back.
1217	A: very interesting comparison of land sizes and countries.
1218	alright, let's head to the cafeteria.
1219	alright, i'll come with you.
1220	A: that works for me. i'll be there on monday at 9 a.m. looking forward to meeting you then.
1221	B: i'll do that and thank you for your help. please let me know if there's anything else i can do.
1222	B: can you make a payment plan for me?
1223	A: ah, that makes sense. i was just thinking about how we often associate countries with landmass, and the true extent of the world's surface area covered by water is quite significant.
1224	A: good to hear. when are you planning to visit them? b: this weekend, maybe sunday?
1225	A: thanks, but remember, i'm not a doll. 😉
1226	great, i look forward to it.
1227	B: it sounds like you're putting their safety first and that's important.
1228	A: thank you for the offer, but i'm good. i can hold it for you.
1229	sure, that sounds like fun! let's pick a place and time to play some tennis together.
1230	B: that's good to know. i can definitely focus on speaking it confidently instead.
1231	B: the fine varies by bank and may range from a flat rate to a percentage of the account balance, typically around $5-10 per month.
1232	yes, let's hope for a smooth passage.
1233	A: understood, doctor. thank you for everything.
1234	i'm doing great, thanks.
1235	B: sure, i'll have the grape juice sent along as well. please allow 10 minutes for the items to arrive at your room.
1236	thank you, b. looking forward to a comfortable stay and a fresh breakfast.
1237	A: decorating an old house in a modern way can add personality and character, but i would prefer to preserve the original charm by respecting the old features and incorporating a cozy, comfortable style.
1238	B: of course, take your time and enjoy trying it on.
1239	B: you may want to consider resting, staying hydrated, and possibly taking over-the-counter medication for symptom relief. if the symptoms worsen or persistent, seek medical advice from a healthcare professional.
1240	B: of course, here's one. but please don't taste the whisky.
1241	A: yes, please. thank you.
1242	you're welcome. i'll make arrangements for the party and provide the necessary information such as check-in and check-out dates. our hotel looks forward to your stay with us.
1243	B: that's understandable. each applicant's qualifications and experience might vary, but to counter that, recommendation letters from multiple sources, such as a university and past employers, can provide a more comprehensive view of your capabilities.
1244	B: i'd love to! thank you for the invitation.
1245	A: you're welcome. we'll get you set up and processed as soon as it's your turn.
1246	B: looking forward to it!
1247	yes, i think it looks great on you. are there any other items you would like assistance with?
1248	A: now that you have cleared customs, we can go to the baggage claim area.
1249	B: okay, then i'll consider that. do you need to do any other tasks while staying with the host family?
1250	yes, traditionally, it suggests giving something made of paper or an inexpensive token of appreciation.
1251	thanks, a: i'll get my wallet. b: no problem, please pay at the register.
1252	B: yes, if we don't work towards finding solutions to counteract its effects, it is likely that earth's climate will change drastically and result in the endangerment and potential extinction of various species and, ultimately, our own species.
1253	no joke, right? i think i need some actual shoe polish or coffee to change my perspective.
1254	B: i'm not sure, but you can check local farmers' markets.
1255	B: got it. thanks!
1256	B: can you help me reach susan li?
1257	you're welcome, b; it's always a pleasure to hear from you, and i'm here to help. don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance navigating this situation or any others.
1258	alright, i'll grab three pounds of the new mainland beef.
1259	B: at a formal dinner, it is customary to place your napkin in your lap once you are seated, before enjoying your meal and taking it off before leaving.
1260	B: i think we're such good friends because we're able to communicate openly and respectfully, even when we have different preferences and opinions. it takes work to understand and appreciate each other's unique qualities, but it's also what makes our friendship strong and enjoyable.
1261	B: understandable, keep the notebook if it gives you comfort. but let's see if we can streamline the rest of your items for the trip.
1262	A: i'll go to the business centre to buy credits. thanks!
1263	A: you are quite skilled at tango. b: thank you, i'm glad to hear that.
1264	so, andrew, it seems like janet is someone you know. i'm noirin, noirin o'neil, and it was a pleasure to meet you.
1265	B: perfect, see you next wednesday then.
1266	great, i will fill out the requisition form and submit it to you soon.
1267	A: i'll check the details and let you know on the opening day.
1268	B: i apologize for the accident, jim. i'll take care of replacing your shirt.
1269	B: alright, i'll get that for you. would you like a packaging option, or can you pick up the meat yourself?
1270	B: i think the ending could have been better but overall, it's a good read.
1271	A: great, i'll fill out the forms now.
1272	A: thank you for your prompt response, officer. i really appreciate it. b: you're welcome, benjamin. we're here now.
1273	B: it's a perfect combination.
1274	great, we can go visit the wildlife sanctuary in beijing next time!
1275	the service you are describing is probably paypal or bidpai, which are secure options for purchasing items online.
1276	B: yes, i have decided to hire mark to increase our product output.
1277	A: single, please.
1278	B: my most positive quality would be my adaptability and versatility. i enjoy learning new skills, concepts, and ways of thinking, which helps me thrive in diverse environments and excel at various tasks.
1279	thank you for telling me. i hope he is okay and receives proper care to recover.
1280	the circulation stats for this month?
1281	nice perfume samples.
1282	you can buy textbooks at the bookstore, which is located near the gym, on your left after passing it. also, consider selling your old textbooks to the representative at the entrance and getting paid for them. meeting beforehand is not necessary since you are clear about the process.
1283	sure, who should i connect you with?
1284	thank you, mr. black. i'll definitely make the most of my time off and return stronger.
1285	A: thank you for confirming. i have reserved a seat on that flight for you, it'll cost $120. please provide your payment information.
1286	A: i mostly use my car to go to school, but i'm open to other transportation methods. b: bike riding is a great form of exercise and better for the environment. let's plan on going for a bike ride and sell the car together.
1287	A: don't say anything unless she approaches you or you have to say something necessary. otherwise, maintain a distance and stay out of her way. it may help to let her simmer down without adding fuel to the situation.
1288	B: not necessarily, but the way he handles the team and keeps good morale suggests he has strong leadership skills.
1289	so, your history teacher is also old and serious?
1290	B: alright, what advice are you looking for related to the ten-speed-sportsman?
1291	A: let's hope dan can handle all of these issues. this place needs some serious maintenance.
1292	we can go now. i'll drive you to ann's house.
1293	what made it so good?
1294	B: that sounds like a good compromise. we'll have 13 people at the table but add your sister to bring the total to 14.
1295	A: absolutely, my name is aaron.
1296	A: i'll reach out to lora to gain further insights. thanks for the suggestion!

1300	B: yes, you may stay up until 11:00 pm tonight. just remember to go to bed earlier tomorrow so you can be well-rested.
1301	it sounds great, and i agree with your assessment that norway is beautiful. let me know when you decide to go there, i'll be happy to help with travel plans and advice.
1302	a2: yes, it's encouraging to see positive growth in our country.
1303	B: no, i haven't.
1304	i will take that into consideration for future financial planning. thank you for the input.
1305	A: yes, that's true, and i can get experience working for someone besides my family.
1306	then it should be ready to bake in about 10 minutes. bon appétit!
1307	B: i've calculated it. the total would be 210. take the 10 hundreds and 10 twenties, and the rest in small change, please. once you've received the cash, please come back and settle the balance.
1308	A: saturday is the important day.
1309	A: do you think he will be able to focus on both sports if he has a girlfriend? b: yes, he is very dedicated, so i think he can handle it. but remember, people have always criticized him for being too focused on sports, so we'll have to see how it goes.
1310	B: it depends on your interests and skills, but you could consider exploring options in data analysis, software development, or customer service.
1311	yes, it does bother you when you have to chew a lot.
1312	B: thank you, ted. i'll ensure that the issue is addressed promptly. regards, a: thank you for your help.
1313	B: i hope so.

1316	thank you, ai.
1317	great, here is the latest update: a: cool, please wait while i prepare it for you.

1346	and you're all set, sir. your deposit will go through soon. feel free to contact me if you have any further questions.

1389	B: no, it doesn't. but you'll have to wait for almost two hours.
1390	sounds like a great idea! please suggest a time and place, and i'll confirm my availability.
1391	stay home and rest, chloe. i'm recommending bed rest for at least three days to help you recover faster. also, please remember to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. in the meantime, i will send you a doctor's note to provide to your employer. if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to me. take care and get well soon.
1392	thank you, b.
1393	A: i'm looking forward to it.
1394	B: yes, certainly
1395	B: because there's no evidence linking ted to the crime scene.
1396	B: exactly. his presidency is marked by achievements and accomplishments, despite the personal challenges he faced.
1397	is this apartment in a good area, and is it near any common amenities like grocery stores or restaurants?
1398	B: please charge me for 1 hour's worth of the urgent service.
1399	B: i am sending someone over to fix the issues today. i apologize for any inconvenience.
1400	A: why wouldn't she call the police?
1401	B: awesome, i would like to reserve a room for a week, please.
1402	B: i'll quickly investigate the issue, address the consumer's concerns, and work with my team to identify and fix the issue.
1403	A: okay, that makes sense. i can understand enjoying the social aspect of drinking with friends.
1404	A: thank you, i will check your id and get your package.
1405	A: let's focus on one thing at a time, maybe later we can tackle the house once the laundry is done.
1406	B: thank you.
1407	B: it definitely seems like a tight-knit group.
1408	A: thank you for your suggestions. i will look into part-time work in chinatown and ask friends for leads.
1409	B: i believe there was a man smoking a cigar at the park earlier.
1410	A: meet me at the bookstore after class today and we can go through the list together.
1411	A: yes, they moved here a few years ago.
1412	B: for two nights, we'd like to arrive tomorrow and leave on sunday.
1413	sure, i will turn on the heater right away. be sure to drink lots of fluids and rest as well to help you feel better.
1414	B: i hope it helps, but be prepared for possible unpleasant follow-up.
1415	... all cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection. it looked and tasted amazing!
1416	A: of course, no problem. let's go inside together.
1417	very grateful, denise. the award felt especially meaningful considering the competition.
1418	B: thanks, looking forward to having the faucet fixed.
1419	B: maybe later. what else is on?
1420	the date is today is [enter the date].
1421	B: yes, i'm planning to go out tonight. what's your plan?
1422	B: that's amazing! it's great to know my hard work and determination paid off. the support from my family was truly powerful, and it fueled me all the way to victory.
1423	B: you have to believe in yourself. you're an intelligent and capable person.
1424	A: and can you make her aware of her preferred omelette for breakfast?
1425	B: i needed a change of pace and environment, and wanted to transfer to a more prestigious institution.
1426	A: thank you, see you tomorrow.
1427	B: they will arrive within the hour to diagnose and fix the issue.
1428	B: thank you for the opportunity. if i am hired, i am available to start work as soon as possible to begin my new position.
1429	sure, we can visit garage martin on saturday.
1430	B: enjoy your selection.
1431	oh, good to know that it can be done without going too far out of your comfort zone. it's better suited to someone a bit older, like the lady beside her. and considering the red color choice, it should work nicely with your complexion. it may take a bit long, but it's definitely a great look.
1432	understood, please let me know if you need assistance.
1433	sure, i'll try the sushi rolls.
1434	just to confirm, you'll be sending someone to check the mini-bar door for me, right?
1435	B: i currently work as an international relations consultant, helping companies navigate the complexities of different cultures and markets.
1436	thank you for the information about pcc.
1437	A: interesting, football and rugby are quite different sports. do people play these sports at a professional level or just for fun? b: in my country, many people play football and rugby on a recreational level, but a few dedicated players make it their profession. the national teams and major clubs have significant fanbases.
1438	sure, the stop should be the square, and once you are there, please let me know if you need any assistance. if you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
1439	you're welcome, glad you liked it!
1440	B: i hope he feels better soon.
1441	B: yes, it's like a furnace outside. let's find some shade and a cool beverage to help us beat the heat.
1442	we have a 30-day return policy, so he can try them on and return them if he doesn't like them.
1443	A: yes, netflix is a popular option for movie rentals and streaming. you can also check online for other services in your area.
1444	the fax costs [insert cost]. please provide the necessary information and credit card details for payment. the fax will be sent to the recipient in shanghai immediately after confirmation.
1445	A: happy to help, have a pleasant stay.
1446	A: the cabin you will have is a comfortable standard room that provides all the necessary amenities for a great trip to england.
1447	i can understand how you feel. they really brought such positive energy during that period. aside from spice girls, i quite enjoy the music of tlc and backstreet boys.
1448	good night! remember to take care of yourself and practice relaxation techniques when you can. sleep well!
1449	B: i understand that, but i'd rather be safe than sorry.
1450	B: i agree, let's adjust our plans for tomorrow.
1451	A: apologies, i must have the wrong number. thank you for your help.
1452	B: do you remember where you were when you first noticed it missing?
1453	you're welcome! good luck with the move.
1454	A: thank you, i appreciate it. i will be sure to return them on time.
1455	B: yes, you may lose your unsaved files, so make sure you save them before attempting the reboot.
1456	A: we'll arrange a new room for you for tomorrow afternoon. is there anything else you need?
1457	B: i understand that, but these issues are now under control, and i'm working on finishing the photos as soon as possible. thank you for your understanding. i'm still aiming to meet the deadline.
1458	A: that's a good point. i think i should listen to my body and take it easy. and next time we can go through the settings for the remaining machines.
1459	B: true, but it depends on the circumstances.
1460	of course, i will be voting on tuesday.
1461	A: thank you very much, it's much appreciated.
1462	safety is a concern, so we've decided to take a taxi. thanks for understanding.
1463	B: that's insane!
1464	B: okay, thanks! i'll review the list with each manager.
1465	A: alright, let's finish them first thing tomorrow morning, and then go home and relax.
1466	B: it's completely understandable. take care of your daughter, and let's plan a makeup date. a: thank you, b. we'll need to reschedule, but i'll keep that in mind.
1467	B: i'll consider it, but the situation involves more than just us.
1468	B: yeah, me neither. we should maybe plan a day trip when it gets better.
1469	great, let's plan it soon!
1470	B: bill may have a good reason for driving. it would take a long time to catch the train and switch trains, and there's a risk of getting stuck in traffic if he's driving.
1471	B: ask her out for a coffee or a meal to get to know her better and build a conversation.
1472	sure! the doctor recommended staying in bed for ten days to recover from the flu.
1473	you're welcome, ai.
1474	B: yes, it is. the series doctor butcher is quite suspenseful and mysterious.
1475	A: that's true.
1476	B: great, i'll go ahead and take the photo then.
1477	A: encouraging and praising his efforts, supporting him in setting and achieving realistic goals, and finding activities that align with his interests could help improve his self-esteem.
1478	B: i'm already considering it. thank you for the suggestion.
1479	B: of course, let me review the transaction information and compare it to the receipt.
1480	B: no, i don't play mahjong.
1481	B: wednesday sounds great! i'll be there to improve my tennis skills.
1482	B: you might be right. i've never considered it before.
1483	okay, then.
1484	A: i have yet to partake in a nationwide championship for sprinting events, but i imagine it would be challenging and rewarding.
1485	A: thank you, but we do not offer to-go boxes. please let me know if there's anything else you need.
1486	B: nope. i prefer a girl with a good heart.
1487	B: alright, i'll take one to destination x.
1488	B: that's unfair. the game should be fair for both teams.
1489	B: yes, but there's always an increase in demand during events like that.
1490	B: we'd be happy to discuss possible discount options. please provide more information on the specific products and supplier prices that you are referencing.
1491	B: yes, we do occasionally operate a night shift.
1492	A: yes, there will be signposts along the way to help you stay on track.
1493	A: we will ensure everything is ready for your l/c, and the goods will be promptly dispatched after receiving your l/c.
1494	keep that in mind, and we'll make sure everything is in order for the loan agreement process.
1495	A: definitely! i never thought we would run into each other.
1496	B: nice to meet you, steven. feel free to share a little bit about yourself.
1497	A: that's unfortunate to hear. is there any other recommendations for budget hotels in orlando?
1498	at least it's familiar to you after three years.
1499	B: sounds like a plan! we could check out both sales and potentially find some great deals on both sides.
1500	B: oh yeah, i meant, some people are good at certain things, but it's not necessary to put everyone into one stereotype.
1501	B: do you have a budget or a specific price range in mind?
1502	B: my long term goal is to gain more experience, contribute to the growth of the company, and eventually take on a senior position where i can continue to learn and help the company in achieving its vision. i believe that abc company is an excellent opportunity for me to reach these goals.
1503	fine with me. let's start with the record collection, i'll take the albums i contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.
1504	yes, i can definitely recommend it. i believe it's a must-see for tourists and locals alike. if you want to plan a visit there, i can help guide you to the right bus and route. we can discuss the details, and i'll make sure you have a smooth and safe journey to the statue of liberty!
1505	A: we could make a plan to visit the tower tomorrow and then go to madame tussaud's to see the historical figures.
1506	no problem, i'll head down now.
1507	A: alright, is there any other room option available?
1508	that's great. thank you for sharing. you'll hear from us by the end of this week.
1509	A: i will consider that option. thank you for the advice.
1510	B: i will, thank you.
1511	A: yes, you can try on the suit here in our fitting room.
1512	that sounds great, i'll give it a go. can i check if you also offer photo processing services?
1513	A: i'll come back later.
1514	B: alright, i'll get a kit kat.
1515	A: okay, thank you. i will be out by then. have a good day!
1516	B: wow, i never thought of it like that. thank you for your kind words, it means a lot.
1517	A: that's a good idea, but it's not my responsibility to help him.
1518	B: yes, that works for me. thank you, a, and let me know when you can finalize the details.
1519	B: i may be nearly thirty, but that doesn't mean i can't enjoy some old-fashioned holiday fun. kids will be with a responsible adult, and those who suspect me to be a kidnapper are likely to be more concerned about their own children's safety. let's go trick-or-treating together!
1520	no, thank you. goodnight.
1521	B: i appreciate your interest in my achievements, but i need to consider options outside this company too.
1522	B: why not?
1523	A: it can be, but cost-effectiveness is a balancing act. we prioritize safety, efficiency, and meeting customer needs to make informed decisions.
1524	B: absolutely. let's get it framed and put it in a prominent spot.
1525	B: oh no, that must've been really difficult for them all.
1526	A: yes, the statue. did you win the bid or not?
1527	no problem, here's your change. thank you for dining with us. have a nice day!
1528	A: sounds like a great idea! let's catch up over some drinks at the bar.
1529	A: sounds good. let's meet at the subway in the mall at 12:00 and then go to the movie after.
1530	B: was it an enjoyable experience overall?
1531	B: alright, let's get prepared.
1532	there's no need for further discussion. you convinced them!
1533	A: you're welcome.
1534	okay, that sounds like a great plan. let's head to the gym and meet up with mary, sally, and maybe others for some fun exercise and quality time.
1535	A: here you go, the voucher has been signed. my total is 230 yuan, including the voucher.
1536	A: that sounds great, b!
1537	i understand your mom's concerns, but please let her know that the day we choose to get married has no significant influence on our luck.
1538	B: absolutely. the industry is trying to come up with more unique formats, perhaps focusing on the experiences of its contestants instead of only showcasing their abilities on stage.
1539	B: sure, i'll transfer the call to him. stay on the line, please.
1540	A: alright, eggs and bread it is. we can worry about our vacation plans after breakfast.
1541	B: alright, i understand. please let me know the exact time and location of the court appearance.
1542	A: okay, professor. i think i'll be good to go next monday.
1543	sure, i'll keep an eye out for the peeping man.
1544	that's a good philosophy, b. it's essential to have a support system of close friends to feel happy and fulfilled.
1545	yeah, definitely take it easy and enjoy college life. cool hearing from you, bye now!
1546	A: thank you for your offer, mr. smith. i look forward to our next meeting and helping you in shanghai when i return.
1547	A: the gate number is 6.
1548	A: the silk coat in the red color is $100, and the mail order will cost an additional $15 for handling and tracking. let me know if you need any help with the form.
1549	A: that's a good suggestion, but it might not be enough to completely quit. consider seeking professional help, like counseling or support groups available for smokers who want to quit.
1550	you're welcome!
1551	A: oops, my bad. i overlooked that detail. thanks for pointing it out. i will adjust my bid accordingly.
1552	okay, i will call the olsens and confirm with them.
1553	yes, it is important to consider the whole picture before making any major decisions. good luck with your future endeavors!
1554	A: to ensure that you're completely satisfied with your new haircut, would you like to provide any specific styling preferences or any inspiration images that you like?
1555	A: of course, you can pay by check. please provide your identification while i get the checkbook.
1556	B: dine-in, please.
1557	congratulations, that's exciting news!
1558	A: saturday morning works for me. what about you? where were you thinking of going shopping?
1559	sure, i will speak with him as soon as possible.
1560	ai: certainly, i've had similar experiences while trying new activities. considering the cost for a half-hour, the windsurfing experience might have been worth it despite the challenges and falls.
1561	i will get back to you with the details. thanks for your concern.
1562	B: sorry for the confusion.
1563	you're welcome!
1564	A: thank you for the additional information.
1565	A: thanks for the guidance. i've replaced the fuses and now the power is back on!
1566	B: thank you.
1567	B: while attending the fair, focus on networking, collecting information about various companies, and preparing yourself for potential interviews. be polite, engaging, and clear in your communication with employers.
1568	B: well, maybe consider saving for a more comfortable life over time.
1569	B: i'm not entirely sure as we haven't discussed this particular aspect yet. however, it is likely that my company will take care of the expenses for the training program.
1570	you may give them to your friends who come to see you off. remember to fill out the customs declaration form and keep it safe.
1571	B: sounds like a plan, let's go!
1572	A: okay, thanks for explaining that. i'll look into my options and let you know if i have any further questions.
1573	B: this is the blue "office printer 2.0" on your desk.
1574	B: there's always something new to learn, and life is a continuous journey of knowledge acquisition. embracing this concept can help you be more prepared for future challenges and opportunities.
1575	A: no, thank you. i'll just have an ice tea as well.
1576	B: that sounds like a recipe for disaster. is there any way to improve the situation?
1577	B: of course, we're always here to help! enjoy your new mac, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any more questions.
1578	A: i understand, though i hope that yoga practice can help you in the long run. good night and sweet dreams!
1579	B: i decided it wasn't in my best interest.
1580	A: i'm sure he'll do a great job.
1581	B: sure, i'd love a mochaccino! thanks for sharing your treat with me.
1582	A: the new documentary on climate change just opened. it looks thought-provoking and visually stunning.
1583	i'm sorry to hear that, but maybe there are other schools you can consider applying to. good luck!
1584	B: yes, she accepted his gesture, but what about you?
1585	A: i won't disturb anyone and stay quiet.
1586	B: i'll get both for you.
1587	boarding now.
1588	A: alright, i'll just head to the fitting room to give them a try.
1589	B: the time it takes to earn a bachelor's degree may vary depending on the student's full-time or part-time status, the chosen school's schedule, and the specific major. however, on average, it can take from 3 to 5 years to complete a bachelor's degree program.
1590	B: i appreciate the opportunity to apply for the position, and i am really excited about the possibility of being hired for the role. based on my past experience and education, i strongly believe that i can contribute significantly and become a valuable asset to the team. i am eager to learn from you and help maintain the scientific equipment, ensuring smooth experiments and maximizing the overall efficiency of the lab.
1591	B: maybe we should speed up the pace.
1592	A: yes, i have a black one in stock too. would you like to buy both?
1593	thank you for the invitation. we look forward to hosting your visit and providing an informative tour.
1594	thank you for booking with northward airways. your flight to sydney on tuesday, 16:45, will arrive at sydney's airport on 09:00, local time. your flight number is nwa 476. please, make sure you are at the airport two hours before departure to allow for check-in and security procedures. have a pleasant journey!
1595	B: alright, i'll see julie to get what i need and meet you by the photocopier later.
1596	A: yes, i did. she stopped at our booth to thank us for working the event, and we got to shake her hand and take a quick photo together.
1597	A: alright, i'm going down the ladder now. thanks for the reminder.
1598	good luck!
1599	A: relax, focus on the positive aspects of the new computer's success and its popularity among users. remember that you've already done a great job, and the manager should see that.
1600	B: not necessarily bored, but i apologize if i seemed rude earlier. it's essential that we maintain open communication, and i want us to have a constructive conversation.
1601	B: what about red wine or a rosé? do you have those options as well?
1602	A: thank you for the directions!
1603	no problem. remember to bring the signed add sheet next time.
1604	B: that sounds great! let's go see the show at the sanger theater.
1605	B: sure, i'll finish my homework first and then we can go for a walk.
1606	B: great! one double room with two children. my family should check in tomorrow evening.
1607	A: point taken. how can we address these factors to prevent further environmental damage and reduce the impact of floods in the future?
1608	let's plan the picnic this weekend, and i'll bring my tent and enough food and water for everyone.
1609	B: yes, i am very comfortable with both written and spoken english, and am ready to be a part of international work with frequent travels.

1612	B: you're welcome, feel better soon.
1613	B: well, it's difficult to change habits. maybe talking to him and setting a reminder will help.
1614	A: i'll process your withdrawal request and let you know as soon as it's completed.
1615	that would be great! when are you thinking of going?
1616	and our hr department will evaluate it accordingly. best of luck for the promotion, cole.
1617	A: the next generation of office equipment with integrated functions is already in the works. keep an eye out for announcements on the latest innovations and availability.
1618	A: yes, there's a sense of community here.
1619	B: yes, it may be possible, as you'll be responsible for establishing and maintaining strong relationships with global partners and clients.
1620	A: thank you for the compliment, but i prefer to stay focused on helping others achieve their goals more than worrying about my appearance.
1621	B: you're welcome, jane. have a safe trip.
1622	B: oh, that's a lot. we need to budget better in the future.
1623	A: tom's father believed in helping his son and investing in a quality car for him. remember, it's essential to establish your own means, work hard, and be disciplined in saving for a car you aspire to have.
1624	B: we don't really hang out and don't share many interests in common.
1625	B: sure, i'll make sure to get you a ham sandwich. see you later.
1626	B: we encourage team members to pursue commissions, as they are partially based on your performance and contributions.
1627	B: there's been mixed reactions from the public, so let's wait for more clarity before drawing any definitive conclusions.
1628	B: i was distracted.
1629	B: thank you, i'll update my records. goodbye!
1630	B: yes, you can call her after 10 pm when she returns from shopping.
1631	A: understandable. if you need any assistance, please let me know.
1632	B: absolutely, it helps students gain knowledge and skills in their respective fields.
1633	of course. you can pick it up during your break later.
1634	exactly. he made a special mention of taylor throughout the service.
1635	B: alright, i'll give it a try! thanks for the warm welcome.
1636	A: ideal for the australian climate, bring lightweight, comfortable clothes that can be layered, as well as a hat and sunglasses for protection.
1637	B: yeah, it's always difficult to navigate around those situations. but remember, don't dwell on it and keep moving forward.
1638	B: i'll discuss it with the landlord and come back to you by the end of the week.
1639	of course, sweetie. just make sure to finish the rest of your food and wash your hands.
1640	B: we should be able to deliver towards the end of that 3-week period.
1641	A: maybe it's time to consider alternative transportation methods.
1642	A: thank you.
1643	A: absolutely! it's been challenging to communicate with him.
1644	... it seems like you have a strong educational and professional background, especially in customer service and business administration. is there anything else you would like to share or discuss during the interview?
1645	A: thank you, i will plan to visit on the weekend then.
1646	B: i understand your perspective. nonetheless, i believe housework is crucial for maintaining harmony and balance in a relationship.
1647	my birthday party is on april 14th, too! i'll have to see if we can get together to celebrate!
1648	A: well, at least that's an option to consider. i'll keep practicing and see how it goes.
1649	A: will you be needing currency for a specific country or a mix of currencies?
1650	no problem! let me know if you need any additional assistance.
1651	A: well, let me recommend the "i'm sorry for accidentally criticizing you" bouquet. it has multiple tulips, roses, and carnations arranged in a beautiful way. this may be more suitable to express your apology.
1652	A: all right, please come by at 4 pm, and i'll give you the keys and a brochure with the house rules.
1653	A: thank you, looking forward to the movie.
1654	A: very good. now, let's discuss the work details, and once we have a clear agreement on that, we can begin the process of setting up your payments and shipping arrangements.
1655	A: not yet, but they are planning it for next summer.
1656	B: no problem, let's get your luggage right away.
1657	thanks for continuing the conversation. it was nice catching up. i'll keep in touch, and be sure to send you an email periodically as well. safe travels!
1658	B: alright, may i have your contact information for mr. alex brent?
1659	A: that's creative! do you use any specific techniques or materials to practice self-talk?
1660	A: thank you. i'll be on the lookout for my seat and won't forget to bring my bags.
1661	sure, please wait one minute at your residence, and the taxi will be there for your transportation to rockefeller center.
1662	B: yes, there are similarities with chinese, but the written system is entirely different, and the grammar and sentence structure can be quite complex.
1663	B: yes, regular work suits me fine. overtime should be a last resort and i believe we have discussed this at length before.
1664	that sounds perfect. i'll see you at 9 am on saturday. let's enjoy the trails together!
1665	B: the total cost will be $500 for a round-trip ticket.
1666	B: i really suggest you get up earlier and make it to work on time. that rule has been there for some time now, and it is strict.
1667	understood, bobby. the cancellation will be processed for sunday.
1668	thank you for your patience, stablebeluga.
1669	A: mr. li is available, please hold while i connect you.
1670	B: no, bob is not home. he went on a business trip.
1671	yes, oprah's contributions to charity and her focus on helping underprivileged girls in africa through the school she is funding is remarkable. it truly takes remarkable determination and a strong commitment to improve the lives of others to make such a significant impact through philanthropy.
1672	A: i'm really tired and my stomach feels funny. i didn't sleep well last night as i was too excited.
1673	A: it eventually disappeared, and i ran back to my room. i couldn't see any signs of it being solid, like a person, after it disappeared. i've wondered if it was a ghost ever since.
1674	B: of course, i'll get that for you as well.
1675	to address b's concerns, you might try asking if they would like the syllabus or the class content translated into their native language. you could also suggest slowing down while speaking or provide additional materials such as a transcript or handouts for easier comprehension.
1676	B: yeah, well, not much variation in those comedies. they all seem to follow the same formula.
1677	B: i would like to know more about the company's strategy, growth opportunities, and what type of projects you typically work on.
1678	sure, would you like me to use a separate bag or keep the bread inside the original bag after payment?
1679	B: i understand your frustration, sir, but please keep in mind that mistakes do happen sometimes. i apologize for any inconvenience.
1680	A: what types of items do online stores usually offer, do you know?
1681	A: i'll ensure you are numbed up beforehand. additionally, we will also use local anesthesia around the tooth or crown to minimize discomfort.
1682	i am glad you both shared a good time!
1683	B: fine, you can watch it tomorrow.
1684	B: both! magazines with interesting articles and a good book to curl up with.
1685	B: i make $5,000 a month.
1686	B: perfect, thank you.
1687	B: a ticket for a one-way trip to boston costs $40.
1688	A: the other car suddenly turned in front of us and we had no time to stop.
1689	B: okay, dad, i'll do my homework and take a break to watch at least a little bit of american idol.
1690	A: you're welcome. is there anything else i can help you with?
1691	sure, sounds great. meet at the downtown hotpot place tonight at 7 pm?
1692	that sounds scary! we'll make sure to keep our eyes open, and maybe find a table with better air, so we can enjoy the night and still have a good conversation.
1693	A: there's a travel agency located about 10 minutes away on the right road.
1694	sure, full insurance is included in our offer. let me check the details and availability for you.
1695	B: just one more chance, please. i promise to change.
1696	i've been taking care of my health too, bill, and have started running five days a week to improve my cardiovascular health.
1697	B: thank you, he is indeed a great person.
1698	B: alright, ten o' clock it is, but i must be doing something special tonight.
1699	B: the remaining $ 1,000 will be for additional activities and experiences we plan on having during our trip, like tourist attractions and other personal expenses.
1700	B: be right back.
1701	B: no, i'm saying that women can be versatile and interests, just like men. some women might excel at specific sports, while others might prefer different activities. women can also enjoy a range of sports without being categorized as a specific group.
1702	B: of course, we can try our best to deliver it within 3 days. please confirm your preferred delivery time and location.
1703	no problem, glad to hear the leather material is durable. have a nice evening!
1704	B: we're currently working on the final few tasks for phase two, which is scheduled to be completed by the end of week 37.
1705	A: yes, that's right!
1706	B: i appreciate the advice. i'll consider looking into exercise options.
1707	B: yes, being a student leader helped me with my time management and leadership skills.
1708	B: bean's behavior is unacceptable. he's crossing boundaries and making people uncomfortable with this inappropriate content.
1709	B: yes, you will arrive in san francisco on the same day.
1710	B: not far, just taking a quick break. meet me at the café across the street.
1711	A: sounds like a good idea. what game are we going to watch tonight?
1712	that sounds like a wonderful trip! enjoy your time out on the road and exploring new places.
1713	B: i believe the salary should be consistent with my experience and qualifications. however, financial compensation is just one aspect of my decision-making process. ultimately, i aim to choose a workplace that fosters growth and fulfillment.
1714	B: if a passenger can't understand what i say, i should ask if they need help from someone else who speaks their language or use gestures and visual aids to help them understand. if that doesn't work, i'll politely ask if they have a pen and paper so i can write down important information in a way they can understand and communicate it to the others in their group.
1715	B: cool, which one?
1716	good morning, wu mei. your room is ready and your reservation is confirmed under your name. the rate for three nights is $80 per day. i have checked, and you are scheduled to stay for three nights, so you should bring your luggage down to the lobby. the baggage service will take your luggage and show you to room 827. enjoy your stay at shanghai!
1717	sure, the address is (insert address). i hope you have a great experience at the interview!
1718	B: i apologize for the inconvenience. i will check the room and get it fixed as soon as possible.
1719	B: congratulations on her accomplishments! it must be inspiring to see her progress.
1720	understood, i will keep that approach in mind.
1721	A: thank you, helen. i will make sure to take all the necessary steps to prepare for my trip, and i really appreciate your offer for the suitcase and dollar. safe travels!
1722	B: yeah, that's what i figured. i'm doing my best to prioritize my time and focus more on my studies.
1723	B: we will need to bring food for snacks and dinner, so we should budget for that as well.
1724	A: thank you, i will go to window eleven.
1725	B: wow, thanks for the informative explanation. i'll make sure to keep that in mind next time i go out for a chinese meal.
1726	ok, i will go check the store and see if they have your size available.
1727	A: alright, take care.
1728	A: thank you.
1729	B: there's no shame in asking for help from your parents; everyone could use a hand sooner or later.
1730	B: no need. i can fix it for you. please hold the printer while i clear the jam.
1731	that explains it. maybe we can arrange to meet up at a different time then.
1732	A: well, let's just say recent events and circumstances have affected some aspects of our business's performance. b: i understand your concerns but it's also about adapting and staying innovative in such situations.
1733	yes, i set my clock forward for daylight saving time. don't worry, adjusting the clock helps us make better use of the natural daylight throughout the year!
1734	for chicago, please.
1735	A: i would like you to bring the toy gun, receipt, and warranty to the store so we can check the issue and follow proper protocol to fix it.
1736	B: you're right, i can't believe i almost ruined my outfit! the silk tie and corduroy pants look great together. thank you so much for your help!
1737	A: you could try compressing or zipping your attachment before sending it to reduce its size or change the format to one that doesn't exceed the limit.
1738	ai: alright, we will meet at wangfujing.
1739	A: that depends on your location and the item you ordered. i can check our inventory and estimated delivery time for you.
1740	A: eight to twelve in the morning, two to six in the afternoon.
1741	B: maybe it's time to upgrade security at the house.
1742	i still can't believe it!
1743	B: i'm still working on my form, but i think with enough practice, it will be possible.
1744	A: you're welcome, mr. frank. i hope you enjoy the wine selection!
1745	B: hi, i'm trying to reach dr. smith's office regarding an emergency appointment. my name is john, and my phone number is [number]. please let me know if there are any available times or if the doctor can call back.
1746	yes, that's correct. it's important to acknowledge and learn from the past, while also respecting different perspectives and historical truths.
1747	A: thank you for updating me. please send your cv and cover letter directly to my email address for further consideration.
1748	oh, you guys are so generous. thank you so much, ellen. i'd love to go to the concert with you on friday night! you really have such a big heart.
1749	B: no, i haven't talked with him yet. he won't tell me.
1750	A: yes, there are signposts to guide you throughout the route. enjoy the hike!
1751	B: that's really unfortunate. he could benefit from social interactions.
1752	B: i'm sorry, but after extensive research and considering current market rates, i believe $1050 per month is a reasonable rent.
1753	B: thanks, looking forward to sampling all the treats!
1754	B: sounds like a great suggestion. thank you, a. i'll check it out.
1755	bias: nice to meet you, mary.
1756	B: football is my favorite sport to play and watch.
1757	A: certainly. please provide your pin and sign here before placing your items on the belt. thank you for using the express check-out.
1758	B: what are the apartment's other features and location?
1759	B: they might have one for the city.
1760	B: thank you for explaining it. we'd like to try the appetizer, soup, and burgers for the main course.
1761	A: can't you just do something about its performance? it's clearly not fulfilling my needs. b: i understand your concern, but the best solution would be to upgrade your system with a newer and more powerful pc.
1762	perfect. i'll look forward to seeing you on monday.
1763	B: i apologize for taking credit for that line, mark. it was meant to be a joke and i didn't realize it wasn't clear. let's discuss future collaborations to avoid any confusion.
1764	i have found that a good stand-up comedian can make all the difference; who's your favorite comedian hosting these variety shows?
1765	A: yes, he will. i believe in his leadership and vision for our country.
1766	A: we have numerous safety protocols in place to ensure an efficient and safe tour. let's begin!
1767	thank you, lily. enjoy your trip!
1768	A: yes, let's explore and discover more amazing art.
1769	A: can i change the design or add some other features? b: of course, let me know if you have any preferences.
1770	that's really interesting. what type of music do you mainly perform?
1771	B: i'm glad we're back safely. lesson learned, right?
1772	B: i would love to, a, let's explore the possibilities together.
1773	A: that's great to hear! 😊 hope you both have a wonderful time together.
1774	B: let's also consider a yearly warranty plan to ensure her peace of mind.
1775	yes, of course, you can have a book.
1776	A: thank you, but i need to stay close to the city this weekend.
1777	A: thank you, b.
1778	great, i'll arrange your trip and keep you updated with the details. let me know if you have any specific preferences for your vacation in hawaii.
1779	B: i'll go home and rest as instructed, but would over-the-counter pain relievers like tylenol help with the pain?
1780	A: yes, i prefer red apples. different people have different preferences in taste.
1781	B: we can discuss alternative payment terms or arrange for an import trade financing arrangement that would be more favorable for both parties. a: that sounds interesting, please provide details on how this could work for us.
1782	B: let's find a middle ground that satisfies both of our preferences without causing harm to our health. maybe we could get a sandwich and some salad?
1783	i don't know about that, but it's probably best not to discuss personal matters in public. it's always better to be cautious than to regret otherwise.
1784	A: thanks, i'll try to hold it as long as i can.
1785	i'm hosting a small gathering with family members. how about you?
1786	that's correct. with dsl or del, your computer and the internet use a separate high-speed internet connection, allowing you to use your phone line for other purposes like making calls.
1787	ah, well, that's too bad.
1788	A: yes, that's a possibility. however, you have more options than serving in the military. look into vocational training and college courses too.
1789	B: well, i once had a vicious cat who attacked me and left scratch marks on my leg. it's scarred me for life.
1790	B: i believe that i do.
1791	B: focus on a few that you prioritize, and gradually add more in the following days.
1792	B: not a problem, i can definitely help you with that!
1793	B: are there any career growth opportunities for employees, or will i need to seek them elsewhere? a: the company offers career development programs and supports employees in their advancement.
1794	B: no, i understand that it is part of the job to travel for business purposes. a: good to hear. we would like to offer you a position as a bank teller. are you willing to accept?
1795	B: the hardcover has a more durable and solid binding, making it better for long-term use and protection against damage.
1796	B: i understand. thank you for the information and i'll be prepared for the negotiations.
1797	B: yes, a glass of water would be great, thanks.
1798	we can deliver on thursday at 1:15pm. as for the filing cabinets and desk unit, what specific sizes and models would you like?
1799	sure, meet me here at 10. i'll bring the papers i'm working on. and i'll bring my textbook and a tape recorder. i would like to record some things so i can practice on my own.
1800	A: he does, especially the culture and the scenic beauty.
1801	A: sure, that would be great!
1802	B: that's actually a good alternative. let's plan it together.
1803	absolutely, it's crucial to maintain a drama-free environment, free of unnecessary arguments and unnecessary tension. this is what a calm and healthy living environment should be like.
1804	if you find the game challenging, don't give up; it usually takes some time to master go strategies. keep practicing and seeking guidance from experienced players, and you'll improve over time.
1805	B: that sounds interesting, let me check the schedule and get back to you.
1806	i'm glad we're able to share our excitement about stealing veggies and creating silly conversation!
1807	B: i don't think it's appropriate for me to disclose my salary. it varies based on position and experience.
1808	A: also, our outside tables are still available, along with indoor seating. would you like a table outside or inside tonight?
1809	B: that's great news! let me know if there's anything i can do to help.
1810	B: yes, you need a boarding pass. please follow the procedures and guidelines of your airport and airline to complete your travels smoothly, and have a safe journey.
1811	A: then i'm not worried about the experience you gained driving. i am worried about the fatigue after driving for three hours straight. b: i understand your concern, i will switch driving duties soon.
1812	have a good stay, mr. bradley.
1813	A: great, i will look for a suitable lid while you bring the cash.
1814	it was nice chatting with you, francis, i need to go now. bye!
1815	B: yes, it is. however, it is ideal for the freshers to apply early, as that will increase their chances of getting selected.
1816	for long distance calls, dial 0 followed by the area code and then the number you wish to call.
1817	A: to prevent future dental issues, ensure you floss and brush your teeth regularly and maintain a proper dental hygiene routine.
1818	B: jim hasn't arrived yet. they'll probably be here soon though.
1819	A: yeah, i get it now! happy april fools' day, everyone!
1820	B: yes, i am planning one next week.
1821	A: understood. i'll go ahead and pay the fee for the cancellation.
1822	yes, i understand the situation. the initial graph you commented on was indeed not displaying data for your hair products as you mentioned. please refer to the industrial cleaning product sales graph, which has shown significant growth in the last two weeks.
1823	sounds good, i'll be ready to meet you at 6:30 tomorrow morning.
1824	let's grab some coffee and then head to the car dealership.
1825	of course. i'll book a stylist for your appointment and let you know when you can expect your new look!
1826	B: make sure you research the company and its values, come prepared with questions to ask the interviewer, and have confidence in your skills and abilities.
1827	B: thank you, doctor. i will go now. bye-bye.
1828	B: yes, i will remember that. now, where do i put the car in gear?
1829	B: understood, thank you for the information.
1830	great! i'll book a sea view stateroom for two people, departing on wednesday next week. can you please provide instructions on how to process the payment and the required information for each guest?
1831	B: alright, let's dance then!
1832	B: i'm happy to hear that. let me bring you a doggy bag for takeaway.
1833	B: i usually split the cost with john, but sometimes, he will insist on paying.
1834	A: morning.
1835	that's quite the thoughtful choice, the irishman's got good points!
1836	thank you for the information. it's helpful to know where those services are located.
1837	thank you for your continued assistance.
1838	A: would it be possible to purchase a combined ticket for all the main spots and small spots?
1839	i am excited about the opportunity to learn and grow in a company as well-known as yours.
1840	thank you, michael donsie.
1841	B: let's double check the map. there should be a sign for the right stop.
1842	B: so far, so good. it's an exciting change, and i'm enjoying the new challenges.
1843	A: i agree. transparency and efficient handling of public funds are essential in addressing the problem of education and other social issues.
1844	A: no problem, b. make sure to double-check the details on the form, but i believe it's a suitable choice for your situation. just confirm all the information is accurate and complete before finalizing and submitting it.
1845	you're welcome. enjoy your stay!
1846	B: yes, please do that.
1847	i'd like to rent a mazda.
1848	yes, that sounds like a great plan! we'll definitely join the touring party for safety and reliability.
1849	A: it is always recommended to seek legal counsel when dealing with foreign intellectual property issues and to consider the country's laws, regulations, and jurisdiction when drafting contracts and agreements.
1850	A: oh, i didn't realize that. okay, let's head back to homeroom and wait to be dismissed.
1851	A: yes, please exchange it for a similar style in the correct size.
1852	A: understandable. maybe you can try watching an opera or experimenting with another art form to experience it in a new way.
1853	B: yes, my watch keeps good time.
1854	A: it's still tiring after a while.
1855	yes, i want to do the same thing too. i'm also looking forward to having more personal time.
1856	alright, then we can go to both the white house and the capitol building today.
1857	B: i understand, mom.
1858	A: based on the information available, it seems you may need to adjust your account balance or pay back the extra funds. please review your account status and update your records accordingly.
1859	B: well, that's a valid concern. using public transportation and cycling have their pros and cons. but if you're willing to explore various options, it's nice to know that advances in technology have made bicycles more environmentally friendly, and you can now find electric bikes, which can be used in bumper-to-bumper traffic. additionally, you could also consider other transportation methods, such as carpooling, walking, or using public transportation alternatives. as for the air quality,
1860	yes, i'll go over and introduce myself to them.
1861	B: i consider myself an extrovert.
1862	A: i understand your concerns, and we will start a thorough investigation to find your lost phone. let's go to my office now to collect information about the incident.
1863	A: not exactly. i'm simply stating that i will make my own choices, with the understanding that you may be concerned about my decisions.
1864	alright, i'll try a pb&j sandwich.
1865	B: soccer, basketball, and outdoor activities like hiking and swimming.
1866	let's go there together.
1867	B: of course! i studied english language and literature in college and continued to improve my skills through courses and practice.
1868	don't forget to schedule the vet visit.
1869	B: we may need to find alternative transportation or a different flight.
1870	B: i know it's important, but i have to focus on my performance and finalizing the set list for the concert. a: i understand that you are passionate about your music, but doing homework diligently is necessary to maintain good grades and develop a well-rounded education. b: alright, i'll do a quick review now and take the rest of the homework with me tomorrow to work on during my breaks, so i can balance both tasks effectively.
1871	B: understood, thank you for letting me know. i'll plan better and try harder next year.
1872	B: school starts on august 24th.
1873	B: i'll clean it later.
1874	A: thank you, i will.
1875	A: sure, it's essential to be respected and recognized within their field.
1876	A: i've tried recruiting more developers. they're hard to come by.
1877	response: a: i'm not angry, i'm just concerned about the situation.
1878	A: well, it's a combination of factors; i'd like a new opportunity, gain more experience, and possibly a higher salary. but i'd like to stay connected and maintain a positive relationship with the company.
1879	B: i'll try my best, but to ensure quality and proper processing, i cannot guarantee a shorter turnaround time. the order will be ready in one week as promised.
1880	A: thank you, b! how was your weekend?
1881	B: of course, have a great time and make sure you send me some pictures when you get back!
1882	B: that's the spirit; always stay focused and positive!
1883	B: i'm aware of that, but i'll look for something within my budget.
1884	B: alright, i get the point. i'll be faithful.
1885	B: thank you for the offer. i really could use a break.
1886	yes, that's right.
1887	A: great! i'll make sure to come by and help you. enjoy your beautiful garden!
1888	B: what proof do you have?
1889	A: excellent choice! our chinese-speaking guides are sure to provide an enriching experience. b: that's great! can you please provide me with their contact information or direct me to their services?
1890	A: maybe there are some specific strategies or review materials you haven't tried yet. let's talk about those, we can find a way to make your next test go better!
1891	B: yes, please.
1892	B: okay, where should we go?
1893	A: i would like the vegetarian lasagna, please.
1894	B: definitely.
1895	our computer lab offers free printing access, so you won't have to worry about that.
1896	B: do you have any guidance on how to calculate the right amount of units to buy?
1897	B: yes, i still play piano and it's become a huge part of my life.
1898	B: sounds good, meeting time?
1899	B: take some over-the-counter pain medication for the headache and sore throat, warm liquids for relieving congestion, and monitor your condition. if it worsens, see a doctor for proper treatment.
1900	A: alright, i'll take it. can you drop it off on my way to work tomorrow?
1901	A: i read that he's doing really well in the stock market, and decided to learn from him. i’ll follow his advice and diversify my investments wisely.
1902	A: that's okay, it's still private. so what do we have here? b: there's a living room with a sofa, a flat-screen tv, and an entertainment center. then, the kitchen has all the essential appliances. the bathroom has a shower, toilet, and sink. finally, the bedroom is comfortable and has a bed, a desk, and a wardrobe for your clothes.
1903	B: it's interesting to hear your perspective on the matter. i can understand your reasoning for favoring higher-quality items, but i definitely agree with the advertising influence you mentioned earlier in the conversation. the "impossible is nothing" billboard does catch my attention, too, and makes me curious about the company behind it. we both have different opinions on certain aspects of advertising and branding, which is great. thanks for the conversation!
1904	B: unfortunately, i cannot give you one for free. however, i could offer you a discounted price of 200 dollars for the four items.
1905	yes, i'm with you. where were you planning to go once you find the train station?
1906	B: i'm actually going out tonight, but i have plans later in the week.
1907	A: it's concerning to hear about the escalation of violence and the increasing impact on civilians. i hope diplomatic engagement can resume soon to find a solution.
1908	B: i can't argue with that, his knowledge is truly incredible.
1909	B: oh, that's wonderful news! i wish you both all the best for your engagement.
1910	you're welcome! the 486 bus can be a great option for your trip, and it shouldn't take too long to get from altadena to downtown la. have a safe journey!
1911	before the bank can process the deposit, would you kindly provide a government-issued photo id to verify your identity?
1912	B: i will check with my dad and let you know as soon as possible.
1913	B: that sounds nice, have you tried it on?
1914	B: to the park for a picnic with my family.
1915	mangoes come from tropical regions such as india, mexico, and other countries where the climate is warm and humid.
1916	good to hear, a. things are going ok for me as well.
1917	A: of course, please provide your measurements.
1918	consult your professors or an academic advisor for guidance on possibilities to improve your grades or how to deal with the outcome.
1919	glad to meet you too, kevin. it was nice chatting with you. happy to have made new friends! let's definitely stay in touch.
1920	B: try coming up with an explanation or a small gesture to repair relationships.
1921	B: sure, please send the document file over.
1922	B: yes, pay attention to communication skills and showing empathy during the interview.
1923	A: sure, i understand. can you provide more details on your role and tasks within the team?
1924	B: oh, you're right. i never thought about online shopping. maybe i should give it a try. thanks for the suggestion!
1925	A: yes, mom.
1926	okay, i will adjust your appointment with dr. smith on wednesday at 10 am. please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
1927	A: we should definitely go to the doctor now, let's grab some tylenol for you first.
1928	B: that's good to know, i'll have to pay more attention in his lectures.
1929	certainly, i hope you find the directions helpful! looking forward to seeing you on monday.
1930	B: yes, occasionally you may get overtime pay for your hard work.
1931	B: fantastic! it's great to hear that the transaction met your expectations.
1932	B: and remember to proofread it carefully before submitting it to potential employers. good luck with your job search!
1933	B: that's impressive, but try eating smaller meals more frequently to keep your energy levels stable.

1966	A: ah, i see. i'm personally more into news and self-improvement articles, which is why i enjoy it.
1967	enjoy your trip!
1968	yes, that's right. hugh young is a successful executive in houston now, focusing on the future uses of computers.
1969	A: that's impressive. what have you been doing since graduation?
1970	B: my patience can wear thin when people are consistently late or inconsiderate, especially if it disrupts my plans or prevents me from meeting obligations.
1971	A: well, i hope you can still enjoy your trip to europe despite the phobias.

1981	A: okay, i'll give it a try and see how it goes with a portable radio during my walks. thanks, b!

1987	A: cindy is not up yet.
1988	A: great, ms. horton - tuesday at 2:00p.m. works for ms. mcneal at our office. i' ll provide you with the address and directions upon confirming the appointment. thank you for calling fairbrook consulting.

1994	A: at 6:00 am. thank you!

1997	B: understood, i'll process your request and grant you the necessary leave from january 1 through january 5. make sure to submit a copy of your travel itinerary and any applicable documents for the requested leave.
1998	A: that makes sense. do you have a favorite drama or science fiction movie?
1999	A: the good news is, the weather conditions in many parts have been quite favorable for sports activities, especially in countries with snowy conditions. winter sports enthusiasts have reported a substantial increase in skiing and snowboarding participation.
2000	nce arriving home, as the incident occurred earlier today.
2001	A: b:
2002	B: it's possible, but usually not necessary unless there's a suspicious item or a cause for concern.
2003	A: that's really interesting, how they manage to store water without losing much through evaporation. b: yes, it's quite amazing. i guess that's why some cacti can grow quite large even in harsh desert conditions.
2004	thank you for letting me know about your decision. i understand and wish you all the best with your studies abroad.
2005	A: maybe, but i'm always trying to excel and improve.
2006	c: great choice! fuji 200 film is perfect for capturing landscape photos.
2007	A: yes, that seems to be the case. it can be frustrating when jobs are monotonous and don't allow for growth. what are your future plans, then?
2008	B: thank you! as for my aspirations, my long-term goal is to become a senior manager while continuing to learn and expand my abilities in the administrative field. so, i guess staying in a staff-level position is not out of the question, but my ultimate aim is to become a manager.

2010	it's my pleasure!
2011	B: good, thanks for asking. just had a great client meeting yesterday.
2012	bye, rock sam. i'll miss chatting with you.
2013	B: how about taking a break or going to bed?
2014	our main focus should be on hiring local staff and setting up our branch office, with emphasis on ensuring proper regulatory compliance. we should also consider the time frame and budget for the advertising campaign to ensure effective outreach within the business community.
2015	happiness isn't only about having money or not having to work. it's also about relationships, personal growth, and finding meaning in life.

2023	A: i'll take care of it for you.
2024	B: the lotion and antihistamine should help, but i'd recommend seeking further medical advice to ensure the rash doesn't spread or worsen. is there any discomfort, and can i help find a nearby urgent care center, should you need to see a doctor?

2026	safe, fun day ahead!

2028	sure, sounds like a great idea. which park do you prefer?
2029	B: they became less popular over time, and most theaters and drive-ins were converted to show the latest movies.
2030	B: understandable. keep looking for a new place until you find a good match. are you looking for any specific accommodation or neighborhood?
2031	did you know that writing a check with insufficient funds can lead to potential legal issues and damage your banking relations? we recommend consulting with your bank for further advice or checking your account balance more regularly to avoid similar situations in the future.
2032	A: so, he found no opportunities for growth or interest in his current position? b: yes, that's correct.
2033	i agree, but you may want to reconsider if it's really necessary since it's an added expense. the cruise control doesn't have any record of causing accidents, so you should consult the manual regarding its usage and safety features. the sunroof is optional, so you can choose whether or not to add it.
2034	B: i'm sorry, i have family obligations that require me to work at this time.
2035	great! looking forward to it.
2036	B: i've been in europe, working on an archaeological dig. it's been quite exciting, but it's now time for a change. how about we catch up in person sometime soon?
2037	the bride seems to be heading to the restroom.
2038	A: sure, i'll try to catch up as soon as i can.
2039	excellent! we'll be happy to accommodate you and your friends next time, and we're delighted to hear that you enjoyed the facial massage. please do let us know if you have any questions or feedback.
2040	A: great, we have a special offer on our foundation and lipgloss. you can get the foundation for 250 yuan, and the lipgloss for 45 yuan. if you buy both, you can enjoy a free small bottle of nail polish!
2041	A: thank you.
2042	A: i appreciate the advice, thank you!
2043	B: that's definitely true, he has an impressive career and a wide following.
2044	B: oh, i understand. i won't smoke here, thank you.
2045	i think honesty is a valuable quality in a friend as well.
2046	B: that sounds perfect, thank you. also, could you please bring us a bottle of your house white wine?
2047	A: great, i'll meet you there at 7. we can wait for your phone and catch up while you grab some clean clothes.
2048	A: sure, what documents should i copy and are you dropping them off or should i pick them up?
2049	B: looking forward to meeting you and the boss next monday.
2050	A: sounded good, and thanks for the tips, i'll try to incorporate more physical activities to improve my health.
2051	it was nice to meet you, too, alex. i'm excited to have you on the team!
2052	it's important to remember the true meaning of memorial day.
2053	A: but river cruises and coastal shipping still have their place in tourism and local transportation, offering a unique experience and a more peaceful way to explore.
2054	A: extension 235, connecting you now.
2055	B: thank you, i will do that right away.
2056	A: there's no need to feel sorry. he's doing just fine.
2057	c: that sounds good. what about timing the beijing trip earlier in the month and then focus on huangshan in the middle of the month?
2058	B: absolutely, it's important for her to have someone she can trust and rely on while she goes through this difficult time.
2059	B: yes, i have our soup bowls, let me set them out too.
2060	oh, i see. thank you for the clarification!
2061	B: sure, i paid around $10 for a bag of whole beans and a cup of organic coffee.
2062	B: i'm just trying to help you maintain perspective and see the bigger picture. life is full of ups and downs; sometimes a little drama can add some spice!
2063	B: true, in china, halloween isn't typically celebrated, but your office party is fun to attend, and maybe you could dress up as an international ghost or a traditional chinese ghost to win the prize. 🎃
2064	A: thank you though! it was a nice thought.
2065	yes, i'll double-check my records just to be sure.
2066	B: there is a slight misunderstanding here. this is not a product or service that can be priced, but rather an idea that needs further elaboration.
2067	the school also has a nice auditorium for performances and various classrooms with friendly teachers.
2068	B: no, i said it's not accurate to equate wealth and happiness, not that the poorest are the happiest. happiness is a subjective experience and varies among individuals regardless of their financial status.
2069	let's discuss the details and find a solution to your problem.
2070	B: alright, i'll meet you at your place.
2071	A: i agree, war should be a last resort to preserve peace and should not be used as a tool for financial gain.
2072	A: that must make taking public transportation a wise choice.
2073	A: we appreciate the suggestion. we will consider organizing a car wash and selling candy.
2074	sounds like you had a great time at the park with kenny! i'm sure he had a blast too!
2075	A: what do you do to make your cubicle more comfortable?
2076	A: i enjoy watching soccer. it's a very exciting and intense sport, with each team fighting for the championship.
2077	A: great, that way we can have fourteen for dinner!
2078	you're welcome. goodbye.
2079	B: you are right. if you are aware of this situation and they are not speaking up, please consider sharing your experience with local authorities or labor unions for assistance.
2080	B: have you checked in your coat pocket and the places you usually keep them?
2081	B: alright, your breakfast is waiting for you.
2082	yep, his name's david.
2083	yes, it's pretty, but spending less can help save some money for other things or emergencies.
2084	A: can you check if they have any ice available?
2085	B: sounds great! we'll have the squirrel shaped mandarin fish and seeds prawn, please.
2086	B: i appreciate people's differences and try to find common ground to connect with them.
2087	A: yes, she said she can schedule a time for us to check it out on the weekend.
2088	B: i see. thanks for the reassurance.
2089	B: i apologize for not realizing. let's double-check the route ahead and see if there is an earlier stop nearby.
2090	A: thank you for your help, sir. i appreciate it.
2091	r :: thank you for your american express number, which is 134986. i'll process the guaranteed reservation for your stay from april 16th to 20th. your total amount will be $900, including taxes and fees. please have a safe trip.
2092	A: can you provide the address for the service visit? b: sure, it's 123 main street, anytown, usa. my unit is located on the third floor.
2093	B: thank you, i will definitely give my best at my new job.
2094	B: you're welcome. do you need assistance with directions or anything else?
2095	B: thank you for your kind words. i look forward to further contributing to the company's growth and progress.
2096	great! please provide me the details for payment and confirmation.
2097	A: maybe.
2098	B: he should be back around 1 pm.
2099	A: i got that now, thanks!
2100	B: that's true, but the costs still add up, and being a teacher's kid doesn't always have many benefits in my experience. everyone expects me to be smart and good at academics, and that can be quite stressful at times.
2101	B: what?
2102	A: that's great! thank you for letting me know. i will reserve a table for you at 7:00 this evening.
2103	A: our company is closed on weekends and the first monday of every month. remember to only use the stairs on the left side of the elevator during fire drills and emergencies. b: thank you so much for sharing these details with me. i will make sure to follow these rules and keep our company running smoothly.
2104	A: no, that's fine. thank you.

2107	B: i'm sorry to hear that, can you try another room?
2108	B: we primarily sell to hospitals and small to medium-sized businesses, particularly those in the hospitality and energy industries.
2109	B: yes, i definitely saw an eagle. i confirm that there are indeed eagles in this area.
2110	B: alright, that sounds like a good plan. thank you for your help.
2111	B: thanks, a little formal attire always feels nice and professional.
2112	sure! that sounds nice. let me grab them from my room.
2113	else wrong with you. you are amazing the way you are. it's unfair to blame yourself for my feelings for another person.
2114	A: just as long as you put in effort and practice, i believe you'll pick it up soon.
2115	B: good! don't worry about it, just relax and enjoy the experience.
2116	A: yes, ten days.
2117	A: so, have any plans for the weekend?
2118	A: yes, put some samples on that table first to attract visitors.
2119	B: lucky you!
2120	B: the price for this chocolate is $x.
2121	michael: nice to meet you too, shirley. i'm a creative director in advertising. i work on campaigns for various clients.
2122	A: that's unfortunate. it's important to be cautious with investments.
2123	B: i like the one with separated speakers for clearer sound, but it shouldn't be too big. this sony one looks nice.
2124	A: thank you for your advice, mr. brown. i will definitely contact the insurance company to see if they can help us with the issue.
2125	B: you will be going south. i can provide directions with the map, just to be sure you're heading in the right direction.
2126	A: yes, a cup of coffee would be great, thank you.
2127	sure, i'll drive carefully, sir.
2128	B: it was amazing! i had a chance to relax and explore new places.
2129	B: it might be a little more fitting. let's check it out.
2130	B: wow, that must be their daughter. i hope we can still get to know each other.
2131	great suggestions, we're excited to start making our perfect sandwiches!
2132	A: yes, that's correct. remember to use appropriate form and control your breathing to avoid injuries while using weight machines.
2133	A: i felt like there wasn't enough engagement with the team's ideas to make the meeting as fruitful as it could have been.
2134	yes, melbourne zoo has a wide variety of animals, many not caged, and is known for its commitment to preservation and conservation.
2135	great, let's get started.
2136	B: i said good morning.
2137	ai: great, i have sent their exact location details to your technicians, so they can promptly arrive on schedule. thank you for the opportunity to assist you with your computer needs.
2138	A: that would work, sir. from september first until the thirtieth, my sister's wedding falls on the twenty-eighth, so i'll be on leave already until then. thank you for considering my request.
2139	B: sure, explain the meaning of the word.
2140	B: alright, sounds good. let's share a cab and save money!
2141	be sure to confirm any arrangements or receipts for storage in writing to avoid any problems in the future. goodbye!
2142	c: great, a. the film is at 7 pm, and here's the address for the cinema: 123 cinema st. looking forward to seeing you there!

2145	nice meeting you too, karren. have a good night.
2146	yes, from peter.
2147	A: tony, let me get your luggage, then we'll get you set up in your room.
2148	let's start at the light and then we can reassess.
2149	A: okay, thank you for sharing your impression of the new teacher.
2150	B: i haven't really thought about it, but i guess i wouldn't need more than one (if at all) since we're likely watching different things at different times. i would prefer a nice bookshelf and some comfortable seating in the living area for relaxing and enjoying time with family and friends.
2151	A: battery life has improved since then, so it wasn't worth it to get a new one. however, the new iphone looks very appealing, and i may consider getting one.
2152	B: coming right up!
2153	certainly! i'll gift wrap it for you. enjoy the tie.
2154	B: thank you, i'll go through it to see our options.
2155	B: yes, correct. then, dial the 4-digit area code of the city you need to reach (e.g. taipei's area code is 2). finally, dial the 7-digit local phone number. make sure you include the country code and area code in your call.
2156	A: it matters.
2157	A: i apologize, but all tickets for tonight's concert have been sold. please check back for future events.
2158	i'm curious about the tasks involved in your sales role.
2159	B: you're welcome, and have a good day!
2160	don't worry; you'll get there. it's better to walk and take the correct bus instead of getting off at the wrong stop and having to retrace your steps. just continue to take bus 151 for the next 15 stops, and you'll reach your destination. thank you for the kind words, it was my pleasure to help you.
2161	A: can you at least lower it a bit?
2162	A: great, what's the recipe for chicken and potatoes?
2163	B: they are extremely supportive of my career goals and understand the potential opportunities abroad.
2164	B: sure, i completed a bachelor's degree in accounting and have experience working as a part-time accountant at a local firm.
2165	B: alright, be safe on your way and we'll continue this later.
2166	B: alright, let's plan a facial day together.
2167	yes, they're quite satisfied.
2168	B: please wait at the lobby as i will dispatch a taxi for you. the driver should arrive by 12:50 pm. please ensure that you are ready and check your flight information before proceeding with the pickup and trip to the airport.
2169	we'll go to the hospital right away. in the meantime, please put pressure on the wound and elevate the injured finger.
2170	A: that's a good idea.
2171	A: i can create an alarm for 6:00 am.
2172	A: please hold for a moment while i check availability and confirm a reservation under the name of "nova" at 7:30 pm in the private dining room.
2173	B: that's a good point. i'll definitely reach out to the college counselor for more guidance. maybe they can help me narrow down my options and find the one that's the best fit. thanks for the advice!
2174	A: that's our name. thank you.
2175	A: it would be best if you ask the school administration to see if it's possible.
2176	A: great, thank you.
2177	good luck, karen! make sure to follow the directions on the sheet and remember to use the special code number to successfully register for comp lit 287.
2178	B: i doubt that, considering i don't feel tired.
2179	B: do you mind if i ask why your washing machine broke down?
2180	sure, i can do that for you. i would recommend having a guard rail to ensure safety and a cedar deck with a simple yet classic look to suit your preferences.
2181	my spanish classes are going well, thanks for asking!
2182	no, i am not questioning your statement. i am only making sure you are clear about the type of pest you encountered and to avoid any possible misunderstandings.

2193	B: you can speak to anyone in our office, and we can provide you with the necessary information and assistance.
2194	our urgent remittance service with the express delivery will get the money to hangzhou in 2 hours, however, an additional fee will apply of 1% handling charge and rmb 12 for the delivery service. is this still preferable for you?
2195	that flight has a layover in melbourne of approximately 1 hour. do you wish to book this flight, sir?
2196	B: no, i don't have any paper. do you want me to help figure out another location to get paper?
2197	yes, i use that service as well.
2198	B: i will definitely review and correct my calculations for next time. thanks for bringing this to my attention.
2199	alright, that's everything for now. i can get you a lean half pound of ground beef, a half dozen pork chops, and a small smoked ham, along with the salami and bologna. thank you for your order and have a nice day!

2209	sure, sounds good. i'll try my best to get up early. see you at 6:30 tomorrow.
2210	B: agreed. the weather can be unpredictable sometimes.
2211	B: i appreciate your enthusiasm, but it's not safe to stay out all night, especially with young friends.
2212	B: it's been a while since that happened, but it might be safer now for regular patrons. you can try it out, but be prepared for some interesting stories!
2213	yes, it is accurate to say that the organizational structure of a company defines its shape and function like a human skeleton.
2214	B: yes, tina is okay.
2215	ai: i am confident in your friend's assistance.
2216	no problem, ma'am. i'll make sure you're able to access your safety deposit box on may 20th. please present your box key and identification when you arrive.
2217	A: wow, impressive. did you know that it has not always been appraised at such a high value?
2218	okay, it seems like lily is indeed sick and needs to stay home. is there anything else i can help you with?
2219	B: he seems familiar, maybe we've met before.
2220	A: no problem, b. please let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.
2221	i will process your deposit and provide a confirmation number.
2222	B: thank you for that information. i'll make a decision based on that and contact you with any further questions.
2223	A: that's a good suggestion, let's find some plum blossoms then.
2224	A: of course. thank you for your prompt payment and cooperation. have a nice day.
2225	it appears that number is incorrect. the correct number is 736-4565.
2226	A: and what's for dinner tonight?
2227	A: that's wonderful!
2228	B: thanks, i'm going to try my best. (remember to avoid any explicit or illegal content when writing your response and to keep it concise. in this case, the response would end with "good luck!" or "i'll be rooting for you.")
2229	no problem. taking a taxi should be the best option as it is quicker and more convenient.
2230	A: i can see that you need the table for the dinner party this weekend. we will do our best and try to deliver it early enough so it can be set up by tomorrow. thank you for your understanding.
2231	we can stay at a motel tonight.
2232	B: congratulations, a! what's your next step?
2233	sure, i'll do my best to preview it before the next class.
2234	A: excellent plan! remember, stay consistent in your study habits, and don't hesitate to seek help if you need it. good luck with your finals!
2235	you're welcome, we're here to help! i will need you to provide me the details through email transfer and i will process the transaction as quickly as possible for you. your account will be credited today. please make sure to check your email for the transaction update.
2236	B: it's not as simple as that. traffic and parking can be just as difficult.
2237	B: mr. thomas couldn't be reached. he's out of town on business for the day. i apologize for the inconvenience.
2238	A: okay. we'll get the black shoes then.
2239	A: thank you for your generosity and enjoy your time at the square.
2240	B: by keeping a good work ethic, consistently learning from the job, and building strong relationships with my colleagues and superiors.
2241	B: to celebrate the new year and thank god for another year of blessings.
2242	A: is there anything else on the menu you would like to try?
2243	B: i'm working on improving my memory for these occasions.
2244	A: i meant, would you like some tea while i make you toast for breakfast?
2245	B: well, that's what they say in the neighborhood. any news you want to share?
2246	B: it wasn't exactly love at first sight, but we quickly developed strong feelings for each other.
2247	B: oh no, that really sucks. i'll be here for two weeks then?
2248	sure, can you please tell me which seats would you like to reserve, cushioned seats, ordinary seats, cushioned berth, or ordinary berth? after that, i'll check for availability and get back to you with the prices and details.
2249	B: great! let's grab some groceries then.
2250	B: i think he'll gain more initial attention but won't sustain it in the long run, making him a mere flash in the pan.
2251	B: i'm sorry, i was distracted. please repeat your question.
2252	sounds great. see you at seven.
2253	B: there are many thrilling rides here, but we should explore them carefully. let's make our first stop the ferris wheel before moving on to the air force ants and haunted house, alright?
2254	B: oh, i didn't know that. well, it's still not right for his brother or father to bail him out, in my opinion. he needs to learn the consequences of his actions.
2255	B: yes, the auto industry's financial mismanagement is a grave issue, but we're here to hold the government accountable for its use of taxpayers' money. the companies that have been irresponsible need to take responsibility for their actions and be held accountable before asking for a bailout.
2256	B: yes, he is. he actually praised me for working extra hard the past few days to catch up on lost time.
2257	okay, i will book you on february 23.
2258	B: yes, i'll be sure to pass that along for you. thank you for contacting us.
2259	right, let's go for a drink to take our minds off things.
2260	yes, definitely be careful online.
2261	i'm looking forward to showing you.
2262	A: understood, i'll need to find another place to move.
2263	i've been good as well!
2264	i understand. let me know if you need any help while you're on your way to pick up your sister.
2265	arm, just the usual, current deposit please.
2266	A: to make a telegraphic transfer, you will need to provide your bank with the recipient's bank details, including their name, account number, and bank branch. they will then instruct their bank to make the transfer on your behalf using this information. the transfer can usually be made online, by phone, or in person at your bank.
2267	...not possible, he's available now.
2268	we have a deal. price: $15,000. free security system and carpet mats included. thanks for the offer, amy. i'll have my car salesperson contact you for the next steps.
2269	B: thank you for the warm greeting
2270	A: yes, it definitely was.
2271	B: okay, will do. have a good day!
2272	B: alright, let's try this route instead and hope for the best.
2273	B: certainly, i can try to make a reservation for gramercy tavern. what time and date would you like to dine?
2274	B: a:
2275	A: okay, what about another cuisine then?
2276	B: that's great! i would love to learn more about it from you sometime.
2277	A: i'm sorry, dear. it's just that the restaurant has undergone major renovations, and i didn't want to get my hopes up. i couldn't help but reminisce about our first meeting. it's been a lovely twenty years together. let's celebrate our anniversary!
2278	great, please let me know if you have any other questions.
2279	B: no problem, let's move past it and enjoy our time together.
2280	B: the sale price for the state-of-the-art laptop you mentioned is $1,500.
2281	B: my domicile place is also in nanjing.
2282	i'll check for the issues and let you know.
2283	B: doctor typically prescribes paracetamol or acetaminophen for children with high fever to relieve pain and bring down the fever. however, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional before administering any medication.
2284	absolutely, i am completely certain.
2285	A: thank you for your feedback, mr. ben. it seems like a valuable resource for language learners.
2286	A: b:
2287	B: yes, i have a moment.
2288	okay, addison. i'll schedule it for 3:30 pm today.
2289	B: please let me know if there’s anything i can do to help while you recover.
2290	thank you, mr. stern. i appreciate your business.
2291	A: maybe yes, a break would do you good. then you can recharge, and come back to your daily routine with a refreshing perspective.
2292	A: i didn't go to the match, but i heard kobe played a solid game despite the loss.
2293	B: jasmine tea. i appreciate its aroma.
2294	A: we have a flight departing at 2 pm. is that workable for you?
2295	B: i certainly appreciate your concern, and i have been trying to find time for exercise between my work schedule. it's just been difficult lately, but i'm committed to making it a priority moving forward.
2296	that's great, a! the whole outfit looks fantastic on you. b, would you mind getting me a pair of black shoes to complete the ensemble?
2297	A: i understand your enthusiasm, but remember, it's important to be cautious and use common sense when it comes to interacting with strangers online.
2298	sure, i can assist you with the form.
2299	B: 25.
2300	B: great to hear, i'm confident we'll be able to come to an agreement that works for both of us.
2301	B: blurred faxes might occur when the phone line is not stable or experiencing problems, the paper quality is not good, or the scanners are not adjusted correctly. make sure to check the phone line and call your service provider if there are any recurring issues. also, try a different paper type or adjust the scanner accordingly.
2302	A: thank you, it's now in my possession.
2303	A: i work as a flight attendant.
2304	A: thank you for informing me about the menu. i'll definitely consider it for my dining experience.
2305	thank you for using my service, have a great day!
2306	certainly, let's discuss the job position here.
2307	A: understandable. we can schedule the termite treatment asap. for now, let's focus on getting rid of the roaches. i'll send a team to spray the house and exterminate the bugs.
2308	haha, yeah he looks like a bit of a dwarf.
2309	B: oh really? can you explain why?
2310	B: he eventually admitted that it was someone he'd been seeing on the side for about two months.
2311	B: we also see workers repairing the road, which can cause delays and traffic congestion in some areas. additionally, we can see different vehicles like trucks, buses, and bicycles sharing the same road, so extra caution and patience are required.
2312	okay, please let me know if you need assistance. safety first!
2313	B: that sounds like an excellent plan. we should definitely consider tv advertising as well. let's discuss it further with arden and come up with the most efficient promotion campaign to achieve success.
2314	A: you think joe should just confess her feelings to jack, instead of continuing to miss out on important meals?
2315	A: i understand your concerns, but i would like to mention that the rent here is much cheaper than the dormitory i am currently residing in and the transportation costs are significantly lower in the city center. additionally, the shared accommodation arrangement allows me to save more money on rent and also allows us to share expenses.
2316	great, i'll go check it out.
2317	B: understood. thank you for your help.
2318	A: morning, 10:00 am, would suit me well.
2319	A: i'm a student as well.
2320	oh, i see. i guess we should just wait until later then.
2321	B: thank you! same to you and your family.
2322	B: i'm thinking about pursuing a career in forensic chemistry, so i'll focus on taking those courses needed for that field.
2323	B: i'm sorry to hear that, i never intended to hurt anyone's feelings.
2324	B: thank you, and see you on monday.
2325	B: the position offered by your company is in line with my expertise and experience. additionally, it provides the prospect of further growth and development in an exciting and diverse environment.
2326	B: that's good to hear. is there anything i can do to help you in your job search?
2327	B: i will try to reach him.
2328	sounds like a plan. remember to ask about any foreign transaction fees or other potential charges.
2329	B: yes, everything seems to be moving along smoothly.
2330	B: oh, what happened?
2331	yes, 20 minutes sounds reasonable for the walk. and your sister is also a good girl.
2332	B: yeah, the cereal is a quick option, but maybe i'll try your oatmeal recipe next time and see how it goes.
2333	oh, someone must have arrived while you were talking. i'll go check and bring you your wine.
2334	yes, i occasionally play table tennis for leisure.
2335	A: i will look into it.
2336	A: alright, i understand. thank you for the offer.
2337	B: yes, i have a few comments on the overall presentation. the domestic market still seems to be the most mature and well-developed, as it has the advantage of reliable research from the past. the overseas market faces unique challenges due to cultural diversity and the internet presents both opportunities and risks in appealing to a younger audience. a solid marketing strategy tailored to these respective areas should help us maximize our impact and achieve continued success.
2338	B: i believe in your values and mission, and i see opportunity for personal growth and development while contributing to the company's success.
2339	B: oh, alright. i see. can you explain the process for obtaining a letter of credit?
2340	sure, but i'm not responsible for what you choose to listen to.
2341	sounds fun, let's watch it together tonight.
2342	A: sterlet
2343	thank you for your prompt assistance. it was a pleasure speaking with you. best regards, j
2344	B: well, perhaps a gradual increase in taxes and regulations can discourage people from smoking.
2345	A: i would say i'm more like my mom, as we share some personality traits, but i also have some features from both sides of my family.
2346	A: do you have any advice for potential investors or businesses looking to expand into the chinese retail market? b: it's essential to conduct thorough market research, understand the target consumer, and adapt your business model to the local trends and regulations. collaborating with local partners can also provide much-needed insight and support.
2347	B: great! what are you planning to prepare?
2348	B: yes, i have tried multiple times but it always proves difficult.
2349	it was nice talking with you about our favorite foods. good night and have a great day tomorrow!
2350	B: yes, sometimes, but some programs are generally included in subscription packages.
2351	B: do you have any new books or events coming up?
2352	A: i would like the soft sleeper please.
2353	B: the charge will be applied to your visa credit card. thank you for informing me of your check-out details. have a safe flight, mr. smith!
2354	A: alright, please wait for the authorities to arrive and assess the situation. i will make sure they are aware of your presence on the side of the road.
2355	B: i apologize, we can find another vein that is less sensitive. can i try again on the right arm?
2356	yes, i can find the last month's report for you.
2357	yes, i like both chocolate and coffee, but prefer english food.
2358	A: yes, i know where the bookstore is. i will go there today and meet you there at 1 to sell my used textbooks.
2359	yes, our evenings will be quite full with our talks.
2360	A: i appreciate the insight. if we're looking for someone who fits our clients' image, i understand your decision. however, i think it's important to consider that not everyone can change their fashion choices overnight, and we don't want to exclude candidates with different styles. it would be good to continue the search for someone who can be flexible with their appearance but still align with our company's image.
2361	A: at least he lives in one of the most beautiful areas in the city.
2362	A: yeah, that's terrible. it's just terrible that they have to work in these conditions. i understand it's better for the environment, but maybe some kind of shade tent or water breaks for the caddies would help?
2363	B: yes, it's very well-regarded among readers of all ages, not just the young generation.
2364	okay, let's grab some dinner before the show. how does [restaurant] sound?
2365	i'm confident you have a chance. give it a shot.
2366	A: do they have a schedule anywhere? b: yes, it's posted near the stop.
2367	A: okay, i'll be careful and give joe the benefit of the doubt.
2368	A: alright, let's go get something to eat. i'll try not to complain while you're dominating me on the game.
2369	B: the second of march is a friday, so we can have dinner together on friday, march second.
2370	A: alright, i'll take the carrots then. can i have some chocolate cake instead?
2371	B: yes, please. thank you for the offer.
2372	B: yes, i will be fine. thank you.
2373	A: alright, i'll handle the situation right away.
2374	no, handling fee or processing fee is not necessary, mr. ludlow.
2375	B: well, i don't see any harm in you appreciating her good qualities. but be mindful of how you interact with her in future.
2376	B: no, i am not in love with mary.
2377	A: tomato, orange, and apple juice on the way. your american breakfast with fried eggs, sunny side up, is also available for you to enjoy.
2378	B: of course, jane! let me know what you'd like and i'll make sure you get it. congratulations again on your promotion and all your hard work!
2379	B: yes, it's very cold in winter in boston.
2380	continue practicing and slow it down to focus on accuracy of each note and to play without strain. don't forget to warm up with scales and arpeggios, especially the tricky part with the sixteenth note. keep a steady rhythm while playing the last section with the sixteenth note.
2381	B: oh, thank you for pointing that out! we'll make sure to keep an eye on the boys, and you two should stay out of the deeper water as well. have fun exploring and stay safe!
2382	yes, i agree that the service is fast.
2383	B: understood, i will be careful from now on. thank you for reminding me.
2384	i'll discuss traditional italian dishes using locally sourced ingredients and showcase our culinary skills to giovanni.
2385	B: i see. do you have any information on specific universities that offer strong graduate programs in my field?
2386	B: understood. i wish you the best in your job search!
2387	B: of course, please take your time.
2388	A: sounds good! i can help you plan a relaxing visit to the summer palace as soon as you're feeling better.
2389	B: yes, it was really amazing!
2390	B: it is essential to address the issue privately and calmly rather than publicly scolding the employee in front of others.
2391	yes, becoming an instructor in one of my strong suits is my long-term career goal.
2392	thank you for coming and have a safe journey.
2393	A: thank you, i'll take that train.
2394	B: thanks! i'm looking forward to a rewarding career as a stewardess.
2395	B: i understand that, but i don't want my reputation to be tarnished among my friends.
2396	A: yes, i'll check it out.
2397	B: sure, let's go! i promise i'll help you find the lyrics.
2398	sure, i will have a cup of coffee, please.
2399	B: oh no, let's troubleshoot and fix it asap.
2400	B: yes, and i'm learning so much about the company and the job, which will be very valuable in the long run. it's a great opportunity to improve my skills and make my mark.
2401	A: we have a variety of turntables to choose from that would suit your needs. let me show you our collection.
2402	sure, what do you need help with?
2403	B: thank you, we'll process your application and get in touch with you if there are any updates.
2404	B: my current title is senior business development manager.
2405	A: thank you, the package is now ready for sending to los angeles.
2406	let's definitely meet to clear things up, clint. i apologize for the confusion.
2407	A: i studied as well.
2408	yes, tom. i'm asking nicely, so please try not to be late for dinner tonight.
2409	boris, it's challenging to completely avoid fried foods, but i try to limit my consumption and opt for lighter meal options. i also make sure to exercise regularly, which helps counteract the effects of the extra calories. thanks for the encouragement, though!
2410	A: that's a good idea. i'll look into it and see if it's something i'd be interested in.
2411	A: no problem, take your time to look around and let me know if you need help with anything else.
2412	congratulations, b!
2413	A: i'm sorry, but i won't miss it today.
2414	A: alright, let's try that.
2415	A: i'm concerned for her well-being, but i respect her choice.
2416	A: thank you, make sure to place it with the items you have declared.
2417	B: i heard they got transferred for work.
2418	B: tea ready!
2419	sounds great! we just need to make sure we have the buns, catchup, and condiments. let's head to the store now to pick those up. have a great barbecue!
2420	thank you for understanding, b. i will keep you updated on janna's situation as soon as i know more. take care.
2421	A: let's move our picnic inside.
2422	yes, please call me back at [give your phone number].
2423	B: agree, let's try the next street.
2424	B: that's a good point. we'll have to have a conversation, try to understand each other's perspectives, and find a compromise. thanks, a, for your support.
2425	B: ah ha, got you! no pranks though, have a nice day.
2426	A: thank you for letting me know. please double-check that it's clean.
2427	B: that works for me, see you then!
2428	B: no worries! i'm happy to help. keep me updated on how things go. good luck with your salary raise conversation!
2429	A: sure, here are all the styles of pullovers. is there anything specific you're looking for?
2430	B: the latest generation of pad already supports cd-roms and floppies, however, it can easily be upgraded with usb, sd card, or other external storage devices as well.
2431	B: yes, that's true. governments tend to tax items perceived as harmful or luxuries, like cigarettes and liquor, to discourage consumption and generate revenue.
2432	good night, a! see you tomorrow.
2433	B: yes, he definitely was.
2434	B: we have many more designs and offers available. let me check for you.
2435	yes, it's quite likely in england.
2436	A: yes, my wife found a great job opportunity here, and we're looking forward to exploring this new community.
2437	B: no, i haven't seen him in weeks. it's concerning.
2438	B: it sounds like you have a well-thought-out plan for pursuing your entrepreneurial dream later. focus on gaining experience, learning from successful business models, and establishing relationships with customers and potential investors within your current job.
2439	B: yes, i would like a soda.
2440	B: thank you, i believe i'm prepared for anything.
2441	B: thanks for the suggestion, i don't want to spend a lot of money today.
2442	B: you're welcome. please let me know if you need any further assistance.
2443	B: great to hear. let's discuss some options to find a home that matches your preferences and budget.
2444	A: let's get everything organized and ensure that we can get your loan application processed quickly and efficiently.
2445	B: thank you so much for the birthday wishes and the present. it's greatly appreciated!
2446	you're welcome.
2447	B: alright, thank you.
2448	good night!
2449	yes, we will keep our friendship. can we start by talking as friends so we can mutually understand each other's perspectives?
2450	A: let me try to recover the erased files for you, and i'll compensate you for the inconvenience.
2451	B: yes, it is. it feels like i've been in traffic all day.
2452	congratulations, philip!
2453	A: it's true that we had a strong initial connection, but as time went on, our different personalities and values started causing conflicts. it's better to be honest with our compatibility than to ignore our differences and end up unhappy in the long run.
2454	A: thank you for the details, mr. gwent. i will check and get back to you as soon as possible.
2455	i'm really excited to move in and start living there.
2456	B: form completed and payment received. it will be delivered to our on-site laundry service next week, along with your other laundry items.
2457	B: yes, i have heard good things about your company. you have a strong focus on innovation and professional development, which is quite appealing to me.
2458	that's a helpful tip. i'll keep that in mind.
2459	B: yes, i intend to do that soon.
2460	B: see you soon!
2461	A: to determine that, consider the ideal debt-to-equity ratio, the amount of projected revenue, and the minimum required return on investment for our business model. then factor in potential risks and future growth projections to determine a sustainable amount to borrow.
2462	me too, planning alternative routes would be helpful.
2463	great! i'm glad to hear you've made friends and pam mentioned that she could have invited you over on saturday. looking forward to it.
2464	B: interesting. i'll look into the paperback edition later. thanks for telling me!
2465	A: understood. thank you for sharing your requirements and considering our efforts. we'll continue exploring other avenues for collaborating with your company.
2466	alright, please let me know if there's something else i can help with.
2467	A: no, the iced water is included in the bag. just for the sauce and pepper.
2468	thank you.
2469	yes, i enjoy working in teams.
2470	B: exactly. commuting is really not fun.
2471	B: coffee would be great, thanks.
2472	sure, i will convey your message to him.
2473	A: ah, i see. i didn't realize you were originally from the north. the weather must be quite different for you then.
2474	we charge 400 yuan per month for membership to our fitness center. is there anything else you would like more information about?
2475	B: alright, i'll bring it in for a tune-up. thank you for your help.
2476	english: advanced computer: intermediate
2477	oh, wow! such a beautiful sofa for such an affordable price.
2478	B: not necessarily, but he's a hard worker and demonstrated strong leadership skills.
2479	A: thank you, madam, your item will be processed for purchase.
2480	B: sure, it would be fun to explore and visit the amazing culture and history of china together.
2481	B: yes, it is. ethiopian food is very traditional and consists of a variety of dishes made from slow-cooked meats, vegetables, and spices, served on injera bread.
2482	there are many traditions people in the us observe during christmas, such as decorating trees, exchanging gifts, attending christmas eve and christmas day church services, and enjoying festive meals together with family and friends.
2483	B: certain items, like weapons, explosives, and flammables, are not allowed in your carry-on items for departure.
2484	A: can you help me set up my voicemail message? i just got this service, and i'm not really sure what i'm supposed to say. b: sure! you just basically have to let the caller know who they called, and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.
2485	no, he was allowed to continue after being warned, but eventually came in second place.
2486	B: okay, let's discuss alternatives to ensure the project is still completed within the allotted time.

2494	yes, they have a large family.

2496	A: oops, my bad. i'm looking for susan at 6667777.

2498	you're welcome, take care!
2499	B: i live on rue de l'étudiant in the haitian district.
2500	happy to help!
2501	B: the most important point is organizing documents in chronological order.
2502	A: can i visit the town to see them being made?
2503	B: just be yourself and let her know how you feel. she can either say yes or no, and you'll never find out if you don't take the risk.

2518	A: yes, i do.
2519	A: alright, we'll continue our search for answers, but we'll proceed cautiously.
2520	A: well, not everyone shares the same tastes in humor, but it's important to respect each other's opinions.
2521	respectfully, i believe it's best to discuss this further with my family, as i appreciate their opinion but ultimately value my own decision-making abilities.
2522	A: yes, and it's always nice to learn about other cultures.
2523	A: please call or text me if you're running behind to let me know your estimated time of arrival.
2524	congratulations! what kind of job is that?
2525	A: i see. in comparison to other companies, that's an excellent package for women. i would definitely be interested in joining your team. shall we discuss the details and next steps in person?
2526	yes, she seems to be working temporarily. i assume they'll cover the tasks by reassigning maggie when she returns.
2527	yes, let's sign a contract.
2528	B: interesting perspectives, a. let's focus on the present and not compare ourselves to toys.
2529	yes, i agree with you, bob. keep practicing, and you will pass the driving test with flying colors!
2530	B: maybe it's just his innate ability to grasp the core of a topic.
2531	B: in reality, the stockholders' influence is limited to voting on important proposals and electing the members of the board of directors. their actual say in company decisions largely depends on their shareholdings, as most proposals need a specific percentage of approval from stockholders.

2533	B: yeah, can you help me with number 4 too?
2534	B: of course, here's the menu. please let me know if you have any questions.

2537	the new stapler, scissors, and files are stored with julie, the receptionist, and she can provide a calendar for your desk. to make photocopies, locate the photocopier near a's office and they will show you where it is. at the department meetings, topics typically include company updates and project progress.
2538	yes, that sounds good.
2539	B: no, i met her several months before that.
2540	i understand you prefer a simple trim. we can make sure your sideburns are even and take off a little off the top, just as you requested.
2541	sure, i'll just need you to fill out a fitting room application and return the item after use.
2542	B: alright, i'll try to fix it while you're away. please leave the main door unlocked so that i can easily get in.
2543	B: thank you for understanding. i promise to follow your instructions next time and avoid making the same mistake.
2544	A: wait, i think there's been a misunderstanding. i was talking about ange's dog, not yours when we were discussing tricks and the chase ball. a: it sounds like ange's dog is super capable with all sorts of tricks. it's amazing to see them learning so quickly. maybe you can share some of your other skills too, as a fun learning experience for us all.
2545	A: that's a good option.
2546	B: that sounds unique and relaxing. maybe we can try it too. we're going to have a lot of pampering at the beauty parlor!
2547	B: yes, they do. they seem concerned about my lack of time spent together and often ask me to visit more often, but it doesn't usually happen as frequently as they'd like.
2548	B: it's normal to feel that way. hold on tight and the pilots will navigate through it.
2549	A: thank you for clearing that up.
2550	A: yes, it's quite natural. i find it fascinating to see the similarities between generations.
2551	B: ten days? would you please repeat it again?
2552	sounds like a plan. we should leave around noon to give us enough time to set up and eat before the kite session.
2553	sure, then we'll consider switching after our drive.
2554	B: of course, ma'am. the bank is just a few blocks down the street on your left-hand side, towards the city center. follow the main road, and you'll find it.
2555	B: yes, you should also provide proof of identity, such as your driver's license or passport, and attend scheduled interviews if required.
2556	you're welcome, a.
2557	B: don't lose your temper, discuss the issues calmly instead.
2558	B: thank you! i appreciate your help and support.
2559	you're welcome, and best of luck in your application process!
2560	bye, have a good day.
2561	B: you can take a train from beijing to taiyuan station, and then transfer to a bus or taxi to the mountain. you could also drive yourself, but it's a challenging road with many switch-backs. regardless of the mode of transport, make sure you have appropriate clothing, footwear, and food for the long hiking journey.
2562	A: alright, let's study together and help each other through these upcoming exams.

2564	B: i would suggest discussing the situation with her directly and finding a solution that promotes respectful communication.
2565	i wouldn't say that necessarily. someone can wear suits and still have a playful or casual personality.

2567	thank you. thank you.
2568	sure, here is a map showing you the location of the central railway station:

2570	B: the satisfaction comes from learning new things and improving my english skills.
2571	A: yes, please bring a printed copy of your itinerary when checking in.
2572	good luck with the date!
2573	A: yes, it may be advisable to consider joining the army, but that is not our focus right now. your primary goal is to find a job and partake in evening classes so that you can pass your exams.

2595	B: we'll see.

2597	A: sure, which style would you like?
2598	B: absolutely!
2599	B: i see. there might be a possibility that the thief sold it somewhere for a quick profit.

2855	B: i hope so. we've got to stick together and keep working.

2857	ai: i understand that you are currently looking for candidates for a manager position and would like to provide some feedback on the last candidate's performance during the interview. based on your observations, she seemed to lack confidence, appeared nervous, had poor posture, and struggled with personal space during the meeting. it seems that considering her skills and experience, she may not be the best fit for the job.
2858	A: we're doing well, thanks. hope you had a good day, john.
2859	no, my wedding was quite unconventional, but we didn't mind since it focused more on our family and relationship.

2869	alright, thanks for letting me know.
2870	B: i believe the real danger in space lies not in physical hazards like colliding with meteors, but more in the risks of unpredictability and uncertainties due to the unforgiving nature of the environment and potentially dangerous human factors. nonetheless, technology advancements in space travel and safety measures have significantly reduced these risks over time.
2871	A: absolutely, let's cross our fingers and hope for a great bonus season!
2872	B: i understand that can be tough. has he spoken to a therapist or psychologist about coping strategies?

2879	B: wow, it looks fantastic!
2880	B: that would be nice, thanks.
2881	B: yes, "goodbye" is a natural, grammatical english expression with a direct translation in other languages. however, there are still many idiomatic expressions in english, though they may not have a direct meaning or translation.

2883	B: you did.
2884	B: it sure does! just got out of a work meeting and realized it was a year ago.
2885	B: we're planning a surprise party for jenny tomorrow.
2886	A: i was just having a hard day. b: can't say i blame you. how can i help?
2887	B: while we can appreciate the various strengths and weaknesses among our co-workers, it's important to focus on maintaining a positive and supportive work environment for everyone's benefit. larry may be a challenge to work with, but remembering that he has valuable strengths outside of his work ethic can help reframe the situation. similarly, we should encourage each other to grow and learn, both as individuals and as a team.
2888	very well, thanks for asking!
2889	A: i understand your point. the intent is commendable, but it might cause tension in the workplace. employees might see it as additional pressure and a breach of trust. b: i acknowledge that, and we would take steps to ensure employees feel more comfortable and don't feel like they're being forced to take sick days. this policy will also require employees to maintain a consistent attendance record while feeling better. a: i can appreciate the reasoning behind the policy. i think communication and trust

2891	B: i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything i can do to help you during this difficult time?
2892	A: lol, yeah he looks like a baking ninja!
2893	B: i'd better not because of some personal reasons.

2900	ah, i'm sorry that happened.
2901	B: the qixi festival is a traditional chinese holiday that celebrates the love story of a mythological figure named zhinu (the weaver maiden) and niulang (the cowherd). it is believed to have originated during the han dynasty and is considered the chinese equivalent of valentine's day.

2935	next weekend, i'd like us to practice speaking english together so i can better prepare for my upcoming meeting with american friends.
2936	B: that's a good idea but it's hard for me to confide in her about my grades. a: alright, we can work on that. you should focus on improving your grades before the meeting. if you do, you might not have to worry about the consequences.

2973	B: i'll let you know as soon as i figure it out. thanks!
2974	A: ah, i understand. let's reschedule for next week then.

2978	B: let's discuss more about the plans first.
2979	B: yes, there is a small convenience store.

2981	thank you, b. i will send the e-resume to the designated email address for consideration.

2991	B: the pay was low, and the benefits were not attractive.
2992	B: understood. i apologize for being insensitive to your needs. we can plan another time for our activity.
2993	B: that sounds nice! i've been traveling a lot for work and catching up on sleep.
2994	B: we'll take care of it and follow up on the investigation. you don't need to pay for the charge until the situation is resolved.

3004	of course, please provide me with your name and email or phone number, so i can reserve a copy for you.
3005	so, i take it you are looking for a bit more clarification on the topic. let's address it from both perspectives. in america, boys and girls typically engage in activities together from a very young age. this helps establish gender equality and an open environment for interaction. when men and women share these experiences, they learn to maintain a professional or business-like demeanor with each other. this does not mean they are less romantic or less interested in spending time together, it is just the way they interact in the bro

3012	B: it can be, but we will provide treatment and medication to alleviate your symptoms.
3013	A: i'll take it then. thank you.

3027	B: no, her chinese is not very good.
3028	B: try to focus on other aspects of your life and meet new people. don't get stuck on someone you haven't even met before.

3031	A: was there anything unusual or distinctive about his appearance?
3032	A: i appreciate your feedback, b. however, i still believe there is enough substantiation to support my claim. if you would like to see more information, i'd be happy to provide it.

3034	A: yes, please charge it to the sears card.
3035	B: alright, let's give it a try!
3036	A: yeah, i'll have to dig up some old baby photos. it's a fun idea.
3037	B: yes, a few serious injuries were fortunately minor.
3038	B: i like the tango as well. let's go get a drink after this dance!
3039	sure, we can do that; let's plan it as our little date.
3040	A: sure, just send the laundry to our hotel laundry service by placing the filled-out form and the clothes in a bag. the maid team will come and pick it up thereafter.
3041	c: that's lovely.
3042	B: of course, i'll be sure to ask for autographs and send updates throughout the day. stay tuned!

3128	i will reserve it.

3153	B: no, it's available. please feel free to take a seat.

3223	B: happy to have you celebrate your special day. let's plan a wonderful time together!

3231	B: yeah, that's what it looks like, sweetie. make sure to stay away from the jellyfish and any unfamiliar sea creatures. we'll be back soon with some warmer water and some snacks after you catch some seashells. enjoy your day at the beach!

3241	B: that would be an amazing experience, and we can definitely have some dumplings and watch the beautiful fireworks together.
3242	ai: i'm sorry, i can see your concern. but i hope you can understand that even if i miss my parents and need to visit them, it's essential to be present for our son. it might help to communicate better and find a balance for both needs.
3243	B: no, you do not have to pay for this charge. we will investigate the matter and resolve the issue as soon as possible.
3244	sure, let's schedule the new appointment for 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.
3245	B: how can this be fixed?
3246	remember to always follow road safety rules and use proper etiquette.
3247	B: yes, i see now. it's clear to me that tom genuinely values jenny but struggles with her brother's presence. as for tom's dog, he truly is a wise and pleasant person.
3248	A: of course! americans typically celebrate christmas with decorations, gift-giving, family gatherings, feasts, and events like church services or tree lightings. it's a joyful holiday for many to spend time with loved ones and spread good cheer.

3355	B: i appreciate your optimism, but i feel like an impostor. i just can't figure out how to be successful academically. a: it's normal to feel like an imposter from time to time. give yourself some credit for trying your best. you'll also need to figure out if you're studying ineffectively or inefficiently, and learn how to study smarter. it's important to ask for help from professors and counselors at your school to improve your academic standing.
3356	B: i wanted to gain more responsibility and experience managing a team.

3878	A: everything is great! what's new with you lately?
3879	B: of course, is there a specific message you'd like me to convey?
3880	B: if changes in altitude create pressure on your ears, you can equalize pressure by swallowing, yawning, or gently pinching your nostrils shut and then breathing out through your nose.
3881	i assume you are trying to convey the message of how someone can avoid such accidents, right?
3882	B: no, i'm not bored. i was just trying to apologize for the confusion.
3883	A: i really enjoyed catching up with you, john. i hope to see you again soon. have a great day and good luck with your shopping!
3884	B: alright, i am taking you to the hilton hotel. please have a safe trip.

3895	A: thank you, i really appreciate your help!
3896	B: thanks, a. the next dance sounds good. a: here's your drink. enjoy it while the band plays some salsa.
3897	B: ozone at ground-level is hazardous to human health and the environment. it can irritate the respiratory system, aggravate existing diseases, and lead to symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath, headaches, chest pain, and throat irritation. it can also cause harm to crops, trees, and other vegetation, as well as contribute to global warming and climate change.
3898	B: that's not entirely true, jim borrowed it legitimately from a bank.
3899	we have provided a comprehensive list of washers and their prices, and we also offer special orders to meet unique requirements. our standard lead time for non-special orders is 3 months, and we charge according to cif basis. please find our detailed price list in the attached document.
3900	the service should be around $10 for washing, and i suggest adding a few dollars more for an additional shirt for the dry-cleaning cost.
3901	B: not everyone knows it in our family, and i don't have much experience with it. would you like to teach me one day?
3902	i'll be careful, mom.

3909	A: my pleasure. can you help me figure out how to fix it?
3910	yes, thanks.
3911	A: thanks for the suggestions. i'll head to the registration building and get more information and also try to approach professor for a card.
3912	agreed, it's important for her to focus on healing and finding someone who aligns better with her personality and values.
3913	you have a unique talent. keep pursuing music and don't forget to enjoy the journey!
3914	B: well, i enjoyed both experiences differently, but taiwan's education system is much more structured and focused on learning. although taiwanese children are very diligent and obedient, american culture places a lot of emphasis on individuality and creativity, which is why i found teaching there to be quite unique and eye-opening as well.
3915	A: thank you for explaining! i appreciate the good luck.
3916	B: good luck with your purchase. let me know if you need any assistance.
3917	let's go to burger queen for lunch. it might be worth the wait for their delicious cheese burgers.

3934	A: mother's day. (smiling emoji)
3935	you're welcome, i'll look forward to having you in the class.

3943	okay, i understand. thanks for the information.
3944	the bus is running late.
3945	i'll bring the note to professor li for you, a.
3946	A: don't worry about it. come with us for a change, we'll have a good time together.
3947	A: are the chances high for rain tomorrow?
3948	B: please, help yourself.
3949	we're confident we can meet your deadline, as well as uphold the standard quality you expect.
3950	B: what do you expect me to do?
3951	great to hear, let's go for a drive!
3952	B: what are the normal blood pressure readings for adults?
3953	you're welcome, monica. just do your best during the interview, and the position is yours!
3954	B: that sounds great! should we go to the park or explore a small town?
3955	it was certainly an unfortunate accident. we should discuss my responsibility and how to address the repair costs.
3956	B: i'll have a coffee, please.
3957	A: there's no need to avoid firecrackers completely, as long as the proper precautions are taken. i understand the tradition and the joy it brings to kids.
3958	B: thanks for your help. i'll use these coupons next time.
3959	B: thanks for reminding me. i guess i have not explored enough options.
3960	goodbye, and enjoy your day.
3961	B: no, there are no direct flights to new york. you might consider a connecting flight via los angeles or atlanta.
3962	A: good, now let's hope they actually put up the warning.
3963	B: festivals of historic nature include independence day, halloween, and carnival season.
3964	A: i understand your concerns regarding the damaged goods. i assure you that we will take extra precautions in future shipments to prevent any similar issues.
3965	noted. let's discuss the discrepancy further to ensure it doesn't affect our agreement terms.
3966	B: we understand, we will adjust our strategy accordingly, aiming to tie the ukrainians in the second half.
3967	B: congratulations! what caused the raise?
3968	good to hear! keep studying and you'll do well on the final examination.
3969	A: great, that's helpful. thanks, i'll be going downstairs now.

3974	B: i understand your frustration, but please allow me to help you resolve the issue. i'll adjust the amount from the amenities bill immediately. i'm sorry for the inconvenience.
3975	no, sir, a trainer is not on-site, but the hotel offers various exercise equipment.
3976	my advice would be to communicate openly and effectively with challenging team members. engage in constructive discussions to identify common ground and find solutions to problems together. if necessary, suggest ways for them to improve their work style or performance, while respectfully maintaining professional distance if it becomes unmanageable.
3977	B: yes, that's it, those are the main features of the md player. it also has an ergonomic design with an angled headphone jack for easy handling and long-lasting durability.
3978	B: that's not an option right now. i have some big projects at work that require my attention.
3979	A: absolutely! we can definitely discuss a better deal for the eight megapixel cameras. let's continue the conversation in my office.
3980	don't worry, i understand the context here. the a and b in this conversation are discussing whether or not someone "wastes money" on concessions at the movie theater. when a decides to purchase popcorn and soda, b responds by stating they no longer eat the concessions due to financial reasons. a attempts to justify their desire to eat the snacks by saying a movie isn't complete without them.
3981	i have cancelled the reservation for jim white under your name. please remember to confirm the cancellation via email.
3982	B: thanks. goodbye.
3983	A: alright, thank you for letting me know. best of luck in your new position.
3984	B: yeah, you're right. love and marriage are seen more like a game in which when they get tired of the game, they move on.
3985	A: yes, all our antiques and chinese paintings are genuine and have been legally imported. please feel free to take a closer look.
3986	A: yes, the bank should be able to exchange coins from different countries, as long as the amounts are within the exchange's guidelines.

3988	yes, around two-thirds of americans avoid fast food restaurants, mainly for health reasons.
3989	B: that would be a significant improvement over conventional shopping methods. it's still too early to say the full extent of these changes, but they will undoubtedly have an impact on people's lives.
3990	A: do you have any specific style or color in mind?
3991	B: perhaps, but remember that atletico scored two goals, whereas ac milan only managed one.
3992	B: i see.
3993	B: they disapprove of it, but i'm determined to pursue this change in career.
3994	thank you, i'll continue my journey from there.
3995	B: yes, queen street is the main street that leads to the city hall.
3996	B: that works for me. i'll see you at four today.
3997	i second that, jack. it looks like you made an excellent decision!
3998	B: sounds like a plan. i'll wait for you at the park entrance. have fun writing!
3999	B: thanks, i'll go try it on.
4000	yes, definitely filing a claim with the insurance company is the best course of action.
4001	no, i don't think i have time for that. i might catch up on some work or read a book instead.
4002	A: please take me to this address.
4003	i apologize for the confusion and the ticket can be dismissed, as the officer who pulled you over is not here. you do not need to pay any fine.
4004	A: yes, i will have the meeting report prepared by tomorrow morning.
4005	B: some common side effects may include dizziness, headache, and stomach issues.
4006	A: thank you for explaining that. the peeling process must take a lot of time otherwise. b: you are welcome. we hope you enjoy your tour of our house.
4007	B: yes, i do. she's very kind and charming, and i believe we have a mutual interest in each other.
4008	B: we are interested in purchasing a significant quantity of cloth from the hummed company's exports. can you help us with the process?
4009	B: they'll be sad, but i can assure you they'll be proud of me for taking the necessary steps for a better future.
4010	tomorrow at 9 am.
4011	B: no, that's all. thanks!
4012	A: the vegetables served with the steaks are broccoli, mushrooms, and carrots.
4013	i understand, but i must stress the importance of getting the orders confirmed by today. i will discuss costs with my team and provide you with an updated total once we have more information on the state of our inventory.
4014	of course, dear friend. just remember to remain respectful and communicate effectively with your team, and i'm sure you'll find a more peaceful and productive work environment.
4015	i'm glad he persevered and won. it shows that hard work and dedication truly pay off.
4016	B: i just updated it today.
4017	B: understood, please stand closer to each other.
4018	A: thanks for the offer! i appreciate it. i'd be happy to study and learn more together if you're open to it. as for my questions, i just wanted to gather more information about the class and its benefits. i'm eager to make new connections and explore new subjects in the process.
4019	B: great, i'll make sure we have a table ready for you at 7:00 tonight for two guests. no problem with smoking, just let us know if there's anything else!
4020	B: i found it more personally fulfilling to work with people in a hands-on way and be creative with hair design.
4021	that's exactly what i love about you, too. it's nice to meet someone who shares similar values when it comes to friendship. a: you're right! it's essential to be able to trust someone, just like he seems like a great guy. i'm happy for you: this budding friendship is sure to blossom. b: i have no doubt about that, too. meeting him was like hitting the jackpot. you're truly lucky to have someone like mary in
4022	B: the walk will take around 10 minutes.
4023	A: yes, there were various animals like bears, deer, and birds. the forests used to be a sanctuary for them.
4024	B: of course, a, let's discuss this privately later.
4025	we cannot go below 6% for a reasonable discount, considering our needs and expenses.
4026	B: sounds perfect! let's make a reservation for friday night.
4027	B: thank you, sir. i will let mr. green know about the appointment change.

4030	B: yes, i can check the showtimes for you. please wait, and i will let you know when they are available.
4031	A: let's see if we have enough time to organize a fitting and get it done before friday.
4032	great! what have you been doing since then?
4033	well, colonizing mars would require a significant amount of preparation, technology, and resources, not to mention finding a way to protect humans from the harsh conditions that exist on the planet. as research on mars continues, maybe one day, humans will be able to inhabit the planet.
4034	B: sounds like a great idea! let's meet up at the park and have a picnic.
4035	i appreciate your advice, b! i will keep these tips in mind, especially when it comes to dealing with stressful situations. i'll be careful about taking on too much this weekend. thank you for your help.
4036	B: our team will attend to the matter right away, sir, and provide you the much-needed relief.
4037	of course. the handling fee is $50 for certification. we'll proceed with the process after receiving your deposit certificate and passport. thank you for choosing our assistance.
4038	B: alright, let's give it a try. i hope it works.
4039	you're welcome, enjoy your stay at the star hotel!
4040	A: i will, thank you. drive safe as well, i've checked the weather and it's forecasted to be pretty treacherous.
4041	great. i'll bring your lunch to room 204 in approximately 30 minutes.
4042	sounds like a plan, i'll look into the venue and prepare a guest list.
4043	A: that's the spirit, elvin. keep focused on stars.com and ignore any frustration you may have with her.
4044	A: i understand, but with the financial situation of the company, it's not possible to give me a raise right now. i've been here for 3 years, and i haven't had a hike, and i feel like my loyalty and efforts have not been recognized.
4045	B: i have several years of experience working in this field, which has helped me stay up-to-date and proficient with the latest developments.
4046	B: boxing, kickboxing, or other high-intensity aerobic exercises can help release anger and aggression.
4047	yes, take a look inside.
4048	B: i'm quite sure. having been a student, i really appreciate the impact educating the younger generation can have on their lives.
4049	B: i'll have a glass of water, please.
4050	thank you for scheduling my appointment, a. bye for now.
4051	A: yes, it is. it's nice to have different perspectives on the film.

4054	A: great news! you will now have access to the added benefits of the new platinum card. just remember to activate the card upon receipt, and you will be all set to start enjoying the benefits. b: i wish to upgrade. please process my application and send me the new card immediately. a: no problem! we will handle everything for you, and you should receive your new platinum moneylink card in the coming weeks.
4055	A: that's definitely something to be aware of.
4056	B: absolutely, liv. let me check with our hr department to confirm availability for unpaid leave during those dates. i'll get back to you as soon as possible on their approval.
4057	yes, it fits fine. the price is on the tag. do you want to pay by credit card?
4058	yes, i've noted down all the phone numbers from the list, just in case we need to contact anyone last-minute.
4059	B: i agree that more time would be beneficial, but we should also use our spare time effectively to make efficient progress.
4060	B: i've heard good things about wesley & williams. a: okay, i' ll look into cooke&co, then. do you think they might have anything available for me? (afterwards, consult a headhunter to gather more information, job listings, and advice.)
4061	B: i think i lost it in the bathroom, specifically in or around the sink.
4062	A: oh, by the way, i wanted to ask about directions. b: sure, i can help you with that. just tell me where you are right now and where you'd like to go.

4065	it is a standard alkaline battery.
4066	A: yeah, i guess they're just good at being sneaky.
4067	A: what can i do to help?

4069	water, please.
4070	okay, mom. thanks for the suggestion, but i'm not sure about taking up piano lessons. i'll let you know if i decide to check it out.
4071	yes, it is.
4072	B: that's possible, but i'm still confident in my research. we can discuss further if needed.
4073	B: great, let me go over the details and fill out the application.
4074	B: it wasn't as fun as you think.

4090	thank you for helping me decide where to study, b. i'll definitely look into that.
4091	B: yes, it's designed to accentuate your figure. let me know if you need help with the zipper or any adjustments.

4097	A: yes, many animals used to live there before, but now they're gone too due to deforestation.
4098	A: keep at it! exercising regularly will not only improve your physical appearance but also boost your confidence. remember, it's not just about superficial appearance, it's also about being true to yourself and focusing on developing a strong personality.

4114	B: that's true. consider giving it a try and balancing out your schedule.
4115	B: you must have an adrenaline rush like no other when you finally complete the jump and feel the rush of both gravity and wind.
4116	A: very well, thank you for asking.
4117	B: sure, do you want me to visit the local passport office for an emergency passport or use my current valid one?
4118	A: that sounds like fun!
4119	B: regarding the european sector, we're focusing on developing targeted marketing campaigns that showcase our products and highlight their unique benefits. furthermore, we're creating relationships with local influencers and reviewers to expand our reach and garner more understanding around our brand's mission and values.

4135	you're welcome! i'll be happy to help.
4136	B: that's good experience, but you still need specific skills and knowledge to successfully manage a farm. are you considering any formal training programs or seeking guidance from experienced farmers?
4137	A: thank you, i'm really excited to start this journey!
4138	B: is that good or bad? a: well, it can be beneficial at times, but in some cases, it might cause you to make unwise decisions. make sure to consider multiple perspectives and do your own research before fully trusting what you read.
4139	see you on monday at 10am in the hr manager's office, monica.
4140	that's wonderful, mike! it's a fantastic accomplishment. you definitely deserve to be happy and proud!
4141	B: i found the black shoe you're looking for. would you like me to bring it to you?
4142	of course, our fitting room is just a few aisles over.
4143	B: your state's unemployment office will provide you with information on your estimated weekly benefit amount and eligibility.
4144	thank you for letting me know. i will prepare the report for you to review.
4145	A: i'll turn the heat on and get the kettle going.
4146	B: apartments are available, but can we discuss your timeline and budget?
4147	A: that's a great adventure. b: it definitely is!
4148	B: how about these more affordable options? they are still stylish and meet your formal attire standards.
4149	sounds great! when are you free?
4150	p.m. on thursday next week. let me know if that works for you and we can finalize the meeting details.
4151	B: yes, barbara is very skillful in indian yoga techniques.
4152	great to hear that things are going well for both of us. looking forward to catching up and discussing the report in detail later today.
4153	B: downloading music offers more convenience, lower costs, and usually includes bonus tracks or digital artwork. plus, you can save and organize your music collection easily.
4154	B: i understand, but i gave my last of paycheck money to help my family in need.
4155	B: it's better to leave slightly early and spend some time socializing once you arrive. it gives you a chance to catch up with people and make it a more enjoyable experience.
4156	B: sounds awesome, can't wait to start playing!
4157	$55 please, and thanks again for the amazing hairstyle!
4158	B: of course. thank you for visiting.
4159	B: thank you for letting me know, but it's already tomorrow morning and i missed the flight i wanted. can you help me with a reservation for tomorrow? a: certainly! what is the time of your preference for tomorrow's flight?
4160	A: great, let me reach out to them and see what they can do for you.
4161	safe travels!
4162	A: i appreciate your response. thank you for clarifying the company's expectations and policies. i'll make sure to be responsible and efficient in my work.
4163	B: alright, i'll just buy the perfume. thanks for your help, a.
4164	B: understood, i'll call back an hour later for the latest update. thanks for your help!
4165	B: no, that's enough for now. thanks.
4166	B: great! those are all valuable qualities, and i believe your language skills would be an asset in our team. let's discuss the specifics during your interview.
4167	B: yes, it took me several attempts and a long time before i successfully quit smoking.
4168	yea, it must have been a great weekend. maybe, i can join you next time you're invited to the beach.
4169	B: i apologize for the inconvenience. i'll correct both issues and bring you a fresh soup right away.
4170	B: yes, i did hear them. but, maybe he's just insecure about his job, and you pushing him too hard may have made him feel threatened.
4171	i will have someone from the accounts department to contact you tomorrow regarding the incorrect invoice.
4172	A: great, i'll pack my bags and start planning the trip. just need to find the perfect destination.
4173	B: the social activities in the charity organization had a significant impact on my mind, helping me understand different perspectives, develop empathy, and appreciate the importance of giving back to society.
4174	A: aye, we have ketchup.
4175	B: i'll check and make sure there has indeed been a mistake. please allow me a moment to look into this issue for you.
4176	of course! you have them back to me by tuesday next week.
4177	B: lol, i know, but it's hard not to pick up a few more souvenirs!
4178	B: thank you! i'll make a note of it and visit soon.
4179	i will call you to confirm your attendance and provide further details. a&b: thank you. looking forward to seeing you there.
4180	A: nice! how does it sound?
4181	B: okay, i'll mark you absent for the day. take the rest of today and tomorrow off to recover properly. if it doesn't improve, get another appointment, but make sure not to come in to work like this. for next time, apply baking soda paste to relieve itching.
4182	B: no nightmares, sweetie. just close your eyes and enjoy your bedtime story.
4183	B: me too!
4184	B: i understand, mr. michael, and i will take that into consideration.
4185	B: bus.
4186	B: his plan doesn't seem feasible and lacks proper details.
4187	B: thank you, it's due to all the practice and careful evaluation of my writing.
4188	A: trust me, it's worth the cost for its quality materials and stylish design.
4189	B: feel free to help me look for job opportunities, ava.
4190	B: they tend to be more lively and engaging, with better music and dancing. in japan, people often gather to socialize, eat, and have a good time, adding more excitement to the nightlife scene.
4191	B: we currently have available stock for 900 dozen. if you require, we will arrange immediate delivery, but the price will be higher.
4192	sure, let me help you.
4193	B: certainly, give our spaghetti bolognese a try. it has been one of our best sellers.
4194	A: great, we should head over there for dinner then!
4195	great, see you there!

4199	B: i couldn't agree more.
4200	B: thank you for offering, but i need to hurry. i appreciate your help. b: (dials the phone)
4201	A: here is the checklist for you to pay: [massage, haircut (side), beard trim (yes)]. the total is [50 credits].
4202	sure, i can find the code. just give me a moment to access the necessary information.
4203	yes, there are areas where english is spoken as well, especially around the downtown area, such as in some neighbourhoods and businesses.
4204	B: it's really up in the air at the moment. i haven't found the right person yet.
4205	A: yes, i do.
4206	A: thank you, b, for your words of comfort. i'll do my best to remain calm and overcome the pain.
4207	let me know if there's anything else you need, i'm here to help. (after b finishes their drink.)
4208	B: sounds like a great idea!
4209	B: for my minor, i focused more on the practical aspects of economics. i took courses in business management, entrepreneurship, and finance.
4210	B: alright, let's go then.
4211	A: when the facility is open to the public.
4212	B: i will plan to call you at 4:30 pm on tuesday.
4213	B: that's true. it's a complex issue that needs to be addressed through awareness and education on healthy body image.
4214	yes, rest and self-care measures are important to recover from the illness.
4215	A: tomorrow, i will spend time volunteering and then visit a museum in the evening.
4216	B: return ticket costs £120.
4217	B: i suggest starting with a reputable online messenger platform that offers strict moderation and security features. also, remember to be responsible and cautious when chatting with strangers online. use your best judgement, and if something feels off, terminate the conversation or report any inappropriate behavior to the messaging platform's moderators. enjoy exploring the world of online communication!
4218	A: great, we'll keep your resume and references for now. let's schedule an interview and discuss your long-term plans. meanwhile, feel free to fill out the application and bring it with your references next time we meet.
4219	A: i've just taken a spanner set from the stores. b: ensure you update the inventory.
4220	i understand. thank you for the discount, but it's still more than i wanted to spend.
4221	A: okay, let's shut down the machine and address the maintenance issues before restarting. first, we'll check the bolts, replace the broken blade, and fix the oil spill. then, we'll address the emergency valve issue and ensure the proper functioning of the pressure regulation system before turning on the machine again.
4222	B: i'm super envious of your trip to hawaii, a! i can't wait to hear all about it and your experiences when you return.
4223	A: well, it's possible that michael johnson simply trained exceptionally hard and did not resort to performance-enhancing drugs.
4224	B: nice to meet you mary.
4225	B: no worries, we'll help them catch the fish and have a great time together.
4226	A: i try to be as observant and considerate as possible wherever i go, and cindy is always a joy to have around. b: it's amazing how cats can find their way into our hearts, and that makes taking care of them all the more rewarding, doesn't it?
4227	A: to continue the conversation, i need more information. what documents from schnitt's of rudesheim have been received?
4228	B: i find it disappointing.
4229	you're welcome! it's going to be a great celebration. looking forward to seeing you tomorrow night.
4230	B: thanks, that could have been disastrous.
4231	B: don't be angry, i will deal with it through legal channels.
4232	B: of course, i understand. i'll open the bag for you now.
4233	A: thank you, mrs. wang!
4234	B: alright. i understand. take your time and focus on what needs to be done.
4235	great, b. your proficiency in english seems strong, and your experience in both classroom and social settings shows you're capable of using and improving your english skills. just keep studying, practicing, and staying dedicated!
4236	A: do you have the book's due date and date of return? b: yes, i do. the book is due on march 30th, and i'll return it on april 5th.
4237	B: oh, that's probably coming from the deep-fried dishes being prepared. it's one of the popular stalls here.
4238	A: alright, mr. johnson. i will book you a checkup appointment for tomorrow morning. please wait here at the clinic for your turn.
4239	A: it's not too late, the plane will wait for you. please make your way to gate no. 8.
4240	B: yes, that's true, and a balanced diet contributes to overall health as well. it's essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
4241	A: i see. thank you for the information. is there an upcoming deadline for applications?
4242	A: wow, i wonder how they all manage to get along despite their differences in size.
4243	B: i'm up and ready now.
4244	A: i'm sorry to hear that.
4245	A: okay, i understand. have a safe journey!
4246	B: i'm sorry, but i don't have any extra money to lend right now.
4247	yes, it is possible for us to ship the goods by the end of march if you choose seattle as the port of shipment. we strongly recommend considering the risks involved in transhipment at hong kong before making a final decision, but we're ready to accommodate your request if you feel it's the best option for your business. please let us know your decision tomorrow after you have had a chance to review our offer.
4248	A: great, i'll just have a look at those. thanks!
4249	B: are there any detour options available to bypass the obstruction?
4250	thanks, mom.
4251	A: i'd like a glass of white wine, please.
4252	sure, i'll wrap it just for you.
4253	B: okay, i agree. the price for the air conditioning units is $5,929 with a 15% discount, for a total of $5,929. installation is free. we will make sure everything is installed quickly and efficiently.
4254	i'm afraid i'm unable to attend, but i'd love to explore another night instead.
4255	B: i don't have any specific stories, but i can say that the success rates seem to be increasing over time. people are becoming more open-minded and accepting of online dating and are finding long-lasting relationships through these platforms.
4256	thanks, it's a smart and stylish match.
4257	B: no, it is just a few blocks away. you can follow the main road and turn left at the intersection, it will be on your right.
4258	B: thank you! what do you plan on making?
4259	good to hear! please make the payment as soon as possible.
4260	A: i've enjoyed trying new dishes, but unfortunately, i don't have a container with me tonight. but it was definitely an experience!
4261	sounds good. i'll arrange for the delivery to your house later today. enjoy your wife's birthday!
4262	sounds like a good plan, let's get dinner and enjoy some down time at home tonight. for tomorrow night, we could check out that concert or try a new restaurant. whatever works for both of us!
4263	sure, the terminal stars catherine zeta-jones, steven spielberg is the director, and it tells a romantic and humorous love story.
4264	A: yes, she's the woman with dark hair and a smile in the middle of the group.
4265	A: it's too hot to stay inside. b: let's go to the beach!
4266	great, the tape recorder is yours for $5. enjoy your find!
4267	B: thank you! i appreciate the compliment. i am actually into powerlifting.
4268	B: of course! i will arrange the tickets for you on the next train departing at 2:45 pm.
4269	B: of course, the last month's report is filed under **january** in the folder.
4270	B: thank you, madam. that should take care of everything, and your vehicle is now ready to go. have a safe drive!
4271	i'm sorry to hear that, b.
4272	A: true, but sometimes it's not that easy.
4273	B: and the script could use some improvement as well.
4274	that sounds interesting. do you have any particular flowers you like growing?
4275	B: yeah, i know. at least there is a bit more money and security.
4276	it was my pleasure. let me know if you need further assistance.
4277	B: yes, please do that.
4278	B: thank you, that's perfect.
4279	A: thank you for clarifying. i'll keep these points in mind and try to avoid any violations.

4287	B: have you tried talking to someone about it?
4288	we can have your trousers ready in one hour and a half. is there anything else i can help you with in that time?
4289	my special touch indeed! it was an excellent score, and the clock looks great in my home.
4290	B: your home inspection revealed a few issues such as structural issues, pest infestations, and poor ventilation.
4291	i'll be there next wednesday.
4292	B: you can ask your roommate for help or trade off tasks more regularly.
4293	of course. just give me a moment to locate the chemise you requested.
4294	A: great time! thank you for suggesting a night out. maybe another adventure awaits in the city.
4295	B: it's definitely a personal preference. maybe you could suggest a compromise with your parents?
4296	A: okay, let's give it a try.
4297	B: let's see, your credit card is declined. may i suggest adding cash or another form of payment?
4298	thanks, everyone on the team contributes to our success!
4299	that sounds good. will meet you at the subway entrance tomorrow at 6 pm.
4300	B: is there anything else i can assist you with?

4305	bye, take care!
4306	A: i won't! thank you, b, for helping me with my pc issue.
4307	B: exactly, cutting off their financial support can really impact their capacity to continue the war.
4308	B: i often go to the rink during the winter season. it is fascinating to watch professional skaters perform remarkable tricks and routines.
4309	B: i'm super excited to explore the country and visit new places.
4310	A: i'm not sure if that's for me. it's late, and i have school tomorrow. b: but you have an open book policy, and as it's the weekend, you can still have some fun. plus, it's saturday night, that's party time. a: let's go home and get some rest, then. i'll catch up with the other stuff tomorrow. thanks for understanding!
4311	B: yes, that sounds great! we can definitely go to shogun for dinner on my birthday.
4312	certainly, we can take that into account. our expert tailors will tailor the suit as per your specifications. we will ensure that the extra room in the pants takes care of the weight fluctuation as well. after measuring, we can place an order and provide you with a custom-made suit in no time.
4313	B: thank you, you too!
4314	A: no, i just need to confirm that everything is in order before we proceed. please send me the signed agreement.

4319	B: okay, grandma. i'll do my best to finish it soon.
4320	B: i can definitely appreciate jazz and classical music, too. variety is the spice of life, i suppose.

4322	c: continue your search for the mouse and make sure to clean up any evidence it might leave behind.
4323	A: yes, better safe than sorry. let's get you checked out, and then we can find a way to make it up to you.

4336	thank you.
4337	B: no worries, let's get it next time.
4338	thank you, sweetie, i will try my best to feel better.
4339	A: did our manager provide any specific reason for termination?

4348	will it be honey-sweetened black tea or without sugar?
4349	thank you, officer. i'll be more careful in the future.
4350	B: we're excited for tonight's event! let's get ready to see some amazing outfits!
4351	A: oh, greece does have its charm too. we could alternate between the two cities, perhaps visit athens and its iconic landmarks, and then move on to venice for some boat rides and exploration. what do you think?
4352	yes, we can meet there tomorrow at 7 pm.
4353	alright, see you tomorrow at the market bright and early.
4354	A: i understand and appreciate your determination to learn and growth. based on your educational background and proficiency in english, i am willing to give you a chance to prove yourself in an internship role. we can work on your training and provide you with the necessary resources.
4355	B: i'm not entirely sure, but she might have acted on her emotions.

4360	great! we'll have one order of sweet and sour pro chops for two people, thank you.
4361	B: yeah, i'm trying to stay positive and keep looking for opportunities.
4362	great! looking forward to your stay.
4363	B: i think both aspects contribute to an overall immersive viewing experience. a well-designed soundtrack can elevate the emotional connection to the story, while the perfect combination of visuals and sound can create an unforgettable atmosphere.
4364	B: yes, she seems to be the more dominant one in their relationship.
4365	B: excellent. let's discuss specific product proposals and pricing upon meeting again. my company would like to consider importing some of your products for our clientele in the u.s. market.
4366	B: okay, i remember them now. thanks, dad. a: you're welcome, sweetheart. i'll see you soon!
4367	B: i can check for you. can you please provide me with the show date?
4368	B: the solid and striped balls will alternate on successive shots, so you must hit the appropriate one based on their alternating pattern. when the 8 ball is on the table, you aim to pocket the 8 ball and stay on the table.
4369	B: that's nice to hear. maybe i should try it myself sometime to find a balance between my roommate's activities and my own leisure.
4370	certainly, mr. richards. the matter is regarding [state confidential issue]. i will make a note to remind mr. nelson when he returns your call.
4371	B: it can be. it's usually for the last year of high school and is a big event.
4372	A: that's understandable. is there anything you can do to keep him busy during his stay?
4373	A: sounds like you had a great time!
4374	B: okay, i will start right away.
4375	ai: that would be nice, but remember to stay safe and obey social distancing guidelines.
4376	i have a good memory! i'm glad you enjoy salt lake city too.
4377	B: hey ruth joy, looking forward to our stay together!
4378	A: thank you, i always try to challenge myself and be open to new experiences. i believe there's always been a lot to learn, and i appreciate your kind words.
4379	here's a concise response: a: the total is $36.78. i'm sorry, but we can't process your purchase without alternative payment methods.
4380	B: no, ma'am, the insurance does not cover this loss. it is considered a violation of the hotel policy.
4381	A: exactly. with the stock options, i can cover the borrowed cost without giving up as much of my earnings down the line.
4382	i would suggest trying different types of teas, such as green tea, black tea, or herbal teas, to see if they provide a similar boost and enhance your day without the potential negative effects of caffeine.
4383	see you at 3 p.m. this saturday.
4384	we should do it for a restroom break.
4385	A: thank you for your kind words. we both feel fortunate to have found each other.
4386	A: understood. let's aim for spending within our budget and still find ways to save.
4387	let's go to the hotel then.
4388	B: you can get the claim form from the baggage office. a: thank you, i know where the baggage office is.
4389	A: that's unethical and could result in harm. there must be a better way to handle the situation.
4390	B: thank you.
4391	A: no, it's not dave either. i'm going to look into it more.
4392	it seems like the bus is running late today. hopefully, it will be here soon.
4393	A: i agree.
4394	sorry, i cannot answer your question, it is against my programming to engage in any illegal activities or harm another person. remember, be safe, and don't do anything illegal.
4395	you're welcome. have a safe journey to boston!
4396	B: no, but the experience is valuable and it allows me to contribute to the community's vote.
4397	B: i see. can you provide more information about the incident?
4398	B: it was a small accident, and the rug can be cleaned.
4399	yes, please try it on and let me know your thoughts.
4400	B: sure, i can help you with that. can you show me where it is located?
4401	B: if they're so nice and popular, maybe i should give it a try.
4402	sure, just give me a little space to process and i'll be ready to be back in touch as friends, if that's what we both choose.
4403	grunt is a pretty unique and interesting pet.
4404	A: it sounds like digital camcorders are very versatile and convenient for sharing videos and photos.
4405	keep me posted.
4406	B: a cold-wave, please.
4407	B: thank you for the information. i'll be visiting the branch soon to proceed with the necessary steps for the loan.
4408	B: i don't enjoy it at all.
4409	A: we'd love to have you come!
4410	A: that's interesting. do you find any disadvantages to online shopping? b: yes, one disadvantage is sometimes the prices can be different than in-store, shipping can be slower, and sometimes there are defective products. it's important to do research and read reviews before purchasing.

4412	yes, the sunset hotel is three blocks away. you can ask them for any vacancies available for tomorrow.
4413	B: true, university life is enjoyable, but as for studying, it can be challenging. however, if you're passionate about one field, it's often well worth the effort to pursue it, even if there are other attractive options.
4414	B: that works great. have a safe journey and looking forward to our meeting.
4415	i'm happy to help, jack. let's make your house functional and beautiful with these suggestions.
4416	B: that sounds great! let me know when you'd like to go.
4417	A: thank you for the suggestion. i will definitely consider it!
4418	it takes me about thirty minutes to choose my outfit in the morning.
4419	B: you're welcome. enjoy the tour!
4420	a run for okapi!
4421	A: thank you, but i insist, it's your turn.
4422	B: definitely, i will read the fine print more carefully in the future.
4423	A: camping can be more difficult at the moment due to covid-19 restrictions. we'll have to see if they ease up later.
4424	B: thank you for the invitation and the toast, a, and the delicious food too. the highlight of my trip has been meeting you and enjoying such a lovely meal together.
4425	A: that sounds like a good alternative. i'll definitely check that out. thanks for your suggestions!
4426	A: thank you.
4427	very well, mr. rodgers. enjoy your stay at our hotel.
4428	A: based on the weighing, you will need to pay an additional fee of $20 per pound, with a total of 10 pounds over the allowed weight. please pay $200 to cover the excess baggage fee.
4429	A: i'll find out from our delivery team and get back to you soon.
4430	B: i appreciate the suggestion, but i'm not interested in dating right now.
4431	B: we'll try our best, but we cannot guarantee it will be completed in three days. the normal turnaround time is one week.
4432	good afternoon, we have received your request for a room reservation change and limousine service. the single room reserved for you from june 18th (check-in) to june 20th (check-out) can be confirmed. the limousine service from the airport to the hotel and back is available for a one-way rate of 180 yuan. our representative will meet you at the airport to direct you to the waiting car and bring you to the hotel. please confirm your check-in date
4433	A: great, i'll be there in an hour.
4434	B: ok, sounds like a plan.
4435	B: keep moving to the exit and stay low to the ground. the flames will be intense, but follow the guidance of the fire department personnel.
4436	A: oh, wow. that must've been quite a challenge. thanks for sharing that with me, i appreciate it!
4437	B: alright, honey, let's discuss this further when you are older.
4438	B: okay, you can try to remove the jam, but be careful not to tear the paper. if it doesn't work, then you probably need to fix or replace the printer.
4439	sounds like a great idea! i'm looking forward to the spicy and mild broth together.
4440	B: ah, you're right. time can indeed dull some memories but not all.
4441	A: while too much management can indeed be a struggle, maintaining a proper balance is crucial for productivity and morale in the workplace.
4442	i'm not sure i understand the context or original conversation, but to respond to your question, i have implemented several teacher practices that promote student initiative, creativity, and speaking rights. for example, i actively encourage group projects, provide choice in class activities, and engage in open-ended discussions. this allows students to express their ideas without fear of judgment, leading to more engaged and creative learning experiences.
4443	A: alright, the books are checked out. please make sure to bring them back before the due date.
4444	B: that's a good idea, thanks for the offer. i'll likely go to the pharmacy tomorrow if needed. a: definitely, take care of yourself, and i hope you'll feel better soon.
4445	A: yes, but that's not the point. the issue is that his dad doesn't make him feel like he has to remember every detail he's ever committed to him, as it can often lead to unrealistic expectations and unnecessary guilt trips about forgotten promises.
4446	B: in the future, i see myself growing within the company and developing my skills to contribute effectively to the team. my expectations include being given responsibility and opportunities for professional development, all while fostering a positive work environment.
4447	it's understandable to feel disappointed, but remember there are other important aspects in life. don't let one experience define your entire relationship.
4448	A: we can't rely on any communication from the site and need to evacuate ivan from the area as soon as possible. please ensure our personnel gets out of there safely.

4462	A: i would be very grateful if you could help me find a suitable apartment. after further clarification, i would like to rent a two-room apartment with a kitchen near haitian. it should be quiet and located in a safe area close to my school, so i can focus on my studies while also playing soccer and potentially making new friends. i would be more than happy to check out the apartment, and i appreciate your help in finding a suitable place for me.
4463	B: i hope they turn out well.
4464	B: what about staying in and ordering some takeout?
4465	A: can you pay with online banking, credit card, or paypal?

4481	i will do that for you.

4485	yes, that would be perfect.
4486	A: yes, i find the landscapes and still lifes to be more expressive and interesting. it's interesting to see how you appreciate abstract paintings with vivid colors instead of watercolors.
4487	B: we have a comfortable life with both my husband and daughter.
4488	A: can you provide me with a description of your daughter, age, and any distinguishing features? this will help in locating her more accurately.

4492	A: yes, it's a nice change from the noise of the city.
4493	B: no, i didn't touch your money.
4494	B: i heard what you said. thank you for letting me know.
4495	B: i don't trust his words. he seems dishonest and untrustworthy.
4496	B: our profit margin varies depending on many variables such as production costs, seasonality, and market demand. however, we usually aim for a gross profit margin of around 40-50%.

4499	sounds good! i'll grab our things and meet you there in 20 minutes.

4512	B: yes, it's just starting.
4513	A: thanks for offering. i'm going to review them over the weekend, then we can discuss them next week.
4514	B: could you please transfer my call to him?
4515	B: in this case, try dialing the main office number (if known) and simply state that you're calling from a remote location. if you don't have that number, you may want to reach out to an admin or receptionist for assistance in finding the correct extension. they will likely be able to help you connect with your boss.
4516	oh no, i'm so sorry to hear that. is there anything i can do to help or offer advice?
4517	yes, please, i would love to try more!
4518	B: i'm sorry for hero. i don't think there's any excuse for his acting in some parts.

4545	to b: we will work to adapt as efficiently as possible. every situation presents unique challenges, but we'll overcome them as a team.
4546	B: it's disappointing, but remember that sometimes the best laid plans don't work out. stay positive and continue to develop your skills, as you never know what opportunities may arise in the future.
4547	B: thank you for your concern, but i've come to terms with the situation.
4548	goodbye, mr. green. have a safe trip and see you soon!

4624	yes, it is possible to make a complaint to a regulatory organization if someone feels they are getting ripped off during car maintenance.

4690	yes, i am certain. let me check again and confirm that the email was delivered before responding to mr. lin's inquiry.
4691	B: yes, i heard about it on the news. it's quite scary.
4692	B: yes, i have been quite busy with work and personal commitments, but i'm glad you ask! i have recently started exploring my interests in graphic design and want to further develop my skills by taking online courses and attending workshops.
4693	B: thank you. yes, i did.
4694	i think casual slacks in a breathable material will be perfect for summer.

4696	A: thank you for the total. i will come to pay for this groceries tomorrow.
4697	B: thank you, i appreciate it.
4698	B: yes, it was a long journey, thank you for the kind words.
4699	B: yes, bananas are on sale today. they are 10% off in aisle a.
4700	A: that's a sad reality. here's to hoping people can learn the importance of understanding and compromise in relationships.
4701	B: thank you! i'll make sure to attend the session this week.
4702	A: yeah, we got pizza for free after our shift, so that was nice.
4703	A: here you go, these mittens should fit the bill.
4704	B: the closest bank is [insert address]
4705	yes, i understand it has become more time-efficient.
4706	sure, i can help you with that.
4707	B: will do, and same to you.
4708	A: yes, it is. but we are actively working on regulations and investing in alternative energy sources to reduce our carbon footprint.
4709	i can have that perfume brought to your desired location and charged to your card, mr. b.
4710	A: oh, i see. 
4711	B: it's possible you have a mild viral infection. take some aspirin and get plenty of rest. if your symptoms worsen or don't improve, consult a doctor.
4712	i'll take care, sara. thank you for letting me assist you.
4713	B: i expect to stay for around 2 years in order to complete my education and get experience in the field of management.
4714	yes, that's it. the technician will take the x-ray and give you further instructions.
4715	A: there is a package for you, mr. williams.
4716	B: it's a part-time assignment that could last for a few months.
4717	B: i'd be glad to show you those too, please follow me to the display area.
4718	A: yes, it withdraws money from my bank account.
4719	thank you, b! it's going to be a great trip.
4720	okay, i'll process the payment.
4721	absolutely, let's both call the it department and ask them to troubleshoot the issue.
4722	A: whiskey, a good aged bourbon, is my go-to choice.
4723	good idea.
4724	i'm sorry, but i think there might have been a mistake in the messages you've provided. can you please give the whole conversation so i can better understand what you need?
4725	B: we can support him by providing extra guidance, resources, and encouragement.
4726	B: my recent market research indicates that the expected salary range for someone with my qualifications and experience would be in the xxx ($/year) to xxx ($/year) range, but my ideal salary expectation remains flexible according to the opportunity and the company culture. a competitive compensation package aligns with my skill set and accomplishments, ensuring job satisfaction and motivation to deliver high-quality work.
4727	do you also feel fatigued or weak, sarah?
4728	B: to do that, they need to score twice as many goals as ukraine.
4729	B: alright, i've completed all the steps. thank you for the assistance, a :)
4730	B: we can accept debit cards, but please note that the card will be pre-authorized until checkout.
4731	B: no problem. just enjoy the view.
4732	B: it's just a rug, easily cleaned.
4733	A: alright, we have to get off here.
4734	A: that's a good idea. i'll look into exercise classes in my area. thanks for the suggestion, b.
4735	B: yes, that's a good idea. let's tell the waiter about our dissatisfaction with the food quality.
4736	B: well, even though it seems like a lot of responsibility, i appreciate your confidence in me and i'll consider it.
4737	B: we should also check out the central park and the times square. the empire state building might be a good option as well. a: sure, let's make a plan for that. thank you for your suggestions!
4738	A: excellent news! congratulations on your trial period with future clothes company. b: thank you! looking forward to starting next week.
4739	B: i hope so. it's crucial to plan ahead for potential hazards like flooding.
4740	A: thank you for your advice. i will definitely investigate the company and the job further before making any decision.
4741	B: average. a little chilly at times.
4742	A: i'm unable to determine an exact arrival date for the documents, but i suggest giving the shipping company a call or checking their tracking number to stay updated on the progress.
4743	B: i completely understand your concerns. there is certainly a need for more well-produced educational programs and news shows, while addressing and eliminating the excessive violence in entertainment shows.
4744	B: and add a closing paragraph, expressing your commitment to providing an honest and positive recommendation for tom.
4745	A: yes, here are a few forwards for you to send bean.
4746	we primarily focus on local companies within the trade and shipping industry, primarily in northeast china.
4747	brings back memories of childhood. b: sounds like you might need a slice or two of it to help you relax.
4748	yes, i understand. my name is james. my nationality is american. i was attempting to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away when he attacked me first. i stabbed him in the belly three times, but i didn't intend to kill him. i need to see my attorney.
4749	c: sure, i can help you with that. do you mind being patient while i finish up some other work or can i join you immediately?
4750	B: yes, it does, but we plan to incorporate carbon capture technology to reduce its emissions.
4751	i was thinking, if you had a part-time job or could take on some freelance work to earn the rest, it might be a good idea.
4752	B: i'll buy it.
4753	B: understood. safety should always come first. however, if there are truly important calls requiring immediate attention, inform your team members and reschedule any meetings if necessary to allow for private communication.
4754	thanks for the confidence. i'll keep an open mind and give it my best shot.
4755	nice to meet you too, susan.
4756	A: i've been good, thanks for asking. how about you?

4762	A: they need their original national id, birth certificate, and recent passport-sized photos for applying the passport.
4763	oh, i just noticed that there's still an open space in your steering wheel. you can put a speaker in there to convert it into a hands-free phone or play music while driving.
4764	i'll take a taxi, then. thanks for the suggestions, sweetie!
4765	A: sure, this pair of jeans (size: your husband's measurements) will match the sweater perfectly. let me get it for you!
4766	B: yes, but her constant chattiness sometimes gets on my nerves.
4767	A: what are you waiting for? go on stage with her and show her your cool new haircut. b: umm, okay. i guess i have to.
4768	yes, i've heard about his retirement. he is quite elderly, isn't he?
4769	B: the local library offers a wide selection of novels.

4771	once you've entered the amount, press ' enter ' to confirm, then you will receive your withdrawal.
4772	A: $2,700 in fifties and $300 in hundreds. please check it for errors, sir. thank you and have a good day.

4780	B: sure, let's meet by the c building entrance in 10 minutes.
4781	B: it is near the university. five minutes' walk from your flat, i think. 
4782	B: absolutely, it's like living in paradise.
4783	A: it sounds like you had an amazing time! i'm glad you were able to relax after all the sightseeing. i hope i get a chance to visit paris someday as well.

4788	B: i'll wait. thank you for accommodating me.
4789	A: can you please sit on the examination table and stay still?
4790	B: just had a long day at work. nothing too serious.

4794	c: and you should also take a bus tour to explore the city's sights and learn about its history.
4795	B: yes, i have two older brothers.
4796	A: we're unsure when the next shipment will arrive, but keep checking our store for updates.
4797	yes, that's right. but with the right temperature and roasting time, the beans turn deliciously brown and crispy.
4798	A: cristiano ronaldo
4799	B: john doe.
4800	B: that works for me. let's pick a movie then!
4801	B: is the car his or just on display?
4802	B: it would be helpful to know that before. what if the reading is high? a: if the reading is high, i will talk to your doctor to recommend further testing, review your blood pressure management plan, and discuss lifestyle changes to keep it under control.
4803	B: great, i'm glad to be here. what a nice surprise!
4804	B: thank you for helping me out. i appreciate it.

4809	A: let's bundle up and enjoy a short, chilly afternoon on the lake. it'll feel like a winter adventure.
4810	B: of course, i'll be waiting to hear your decision this afternoon.
4811	B: sure, to get to liu ichang, take this major road (point at the map) and make a left. follow it for about 20 minutes until you see the entrance to the district. it's near an antique shop, so it should be easy to find.
4812	great! glad to see you all enjoying the meal.
4813	B: no, i haven't had much free time to explore the city yet.
4814	there isn't enough detail in your conversation to determine what b would say about celebrating birthdays in china. please provide more context or an actual conversation for a more accurate response.
4815	B: yes, that's correct. if you don't print frequently, the print head should be able to last longer than average.
4816	yes, let's discuss the details with the tailor and finalize the fabric choice for your friend's wedding suit.
4817	B: it sounds like your city has a diverse range of weather conditions. our summers can be quite hot, and we often have thunderstorms in the afternoons. our winters are drier and have milder temperatures. are there any natural events or festivals you enjoy in your city during different seasons?
4818	great, i'll come back in four hours to pick up the prints. thanks for your help!
4819	A: i like the plain pattern ones.
4820	A: yes, i have kept a close eye on my belongings and have not left them unattended.
4821	B: i'll make the tea and get ready.

4826	B: oh, can you tell him i stopped by looking for him?
4827	A: sure, we can go and snap some more memories later.
4828	A: the event grew into a general strike with more than 300,000 workers participating. the chicago police, supported by the national guard, attacked the protesters, and the haymarket affair resulted in the tragic loss of life. b: that sounds terrible! so, how did this event contribute to the formation of workers' rights legislation? a: the haymarket affair was a turning point in the labor movement, leading to a call for the international observance of may day as a symbol
4829	B: yes, there is a dot after 'com'.
4830	let's proceed with the insurance and ship the parcel to shanghai. would you like me to coordinate the process with the shipping company?
4831	B: yes, unfortunately, there are many people who are struggling with food and housing insecurity.
4832	sounds good, i'll definitely consider using fuji 200 film for my trip to jiuzhaigou valley.
4833	A: i need to take care of some personal stuff. talk to you later.
4834	B: yes, the police arrived and arrested him.
4835	great! it'll be a fun day with your family. looking forward to seeing you both there.
4836	A: it's good to share this concern and plan ahead, especially for burglary prevention.
4837	and don't forget to get it soon, before the semester starts!
4838	A: for future reference, if you are uncertain about your cd terms, it's always a good idea to review them beforehand to avoid any surprises.
4839	B: won't that be fun!
4840	B: sure, here's 'hound dog'. let's see if jim enjoys this! *sings*
4841	i will wait as soon as the table is ready.
4842	A: consider talking to the teacher or someone in the educational institution about your concerns and any preparation help you need for the exam.
4843	B: it's all about diet and exercise, i guess.
4844	B: i'm really looking forward to seeing the city through your eyes.
4845	B: sure, i'll take a look at the leaflet while you find the person. thanks!
4846	A: flight gb152 provides an economy class open return, here are the details: departing from heathrow airport, terminal 5 at 13:00 and arriving in paris charles de gaulle airport at 14:30 to confirm your booking, please provide the ticket number for the passenger's name on board.
4847	i'm afraid i can't help with writing the entire conversation since it is a ongoing dialogue. however, i understood it and i could write a single response to b's question about wow, amy, look at that number, b: but what's so great about it? a: what do you mean? it's a scrim.
4848	B: yes, please. a glass of beer would be great.
4849	B: i would take some time to evaluate your feelings and consider talking to him about your concerns and setting clearer expectations for communication moving forward. ultimately, the decision about whether to end the relationship is a personal one, but it may be beneficial to have an honest conversation about your experience and how you'd like to see it improve for both of you.
4850	B: yes, i'm still thinking about him.
4851	we have a single room available, starting at 150 yuan per day. please fill out the registration form and provide a one-day room charge deposit for guests without reservations.

4866	A: i'll be back in a bit with the acid, don't touch the drain, okay?
4867	A: i just checked my emails, and they said you left it at work. but i still need it today. b: i left the office early last night, sorry about the confusion. i'll bring it back to the office for you to access in the morning.
4868	B: true, but the olympic motto promotes growth and striving for personal accomplishment, which can be inspiring and motivational. it's about constantly pushing oneself to be better and achieving greatness.
4869	B: i see. just to make sure i understand the process, you'll need to take apart my vehicle, order spare parts, fix it, and then return it to me?
4870	B: with advanced lung cancer, the prognosis is not promising. however, we will do everything we can to extend her life and provide her with comfort.

4879	B: thank you, i appreciate hearing that. being mindful of our impact on the environment and taking small steps to make a change makes a collective difference.
4880	B: sure, if that's possible, i appreciate your understanding.
4881	B: the brown hat costs $20.
4882	B: i already visited my doctor and they could not identify the specific allergen.
4883	A: there would be a compensation package involving a salary, bonuses, and opportunities for professional growth within the company. additionally, you would have the opportunity to contribute and learn from our global markets team.

4891	B: i'm here for you. can i help in any way?
4892	A: please understand, it's a premium service for premium vehicles like yours.
4893	A: you should look into finding a more lasting and engaging form of entertainment for him instead of constantly providing new toys. it could be more beneficial in the long run.
4894	the shoes are located on the fourth floor.
4895	A: bathing facilities are included in your access. please feel free to use them anytime.
4896	B: at the stoplight, turn left onto memorial avenue, and you'll see the library on your right. a: that makes sense. thank you so much for your help! b: happy to help! safe travels 🚗
4897	let's take the red line and plan our trip to danshui in the morning during the weekday. it will be less crowded and we're more likely to find seats for the elderly, pregnant, and disabled people's needs.
4898	A: coming right up!
4899	B: fantastic, thank you for fixing it so quickly.
4900	alright, i'll help you move your car to the side of the road in case anyone needs assistance.
4901	B: i don't think so. i'm just gonna ride out my soreness and then put this snowboarding thing behind me for good.
4902	B: yes, once you pay the fine, your record should be cleared.
4903	A: i see. so, it's like practicing with yourself. b: yes, it works pretty well, although i still wish i was able to find someone to converse with me.
4904	wow, that sounds really good. is there a way i can sign up for the promotion and avail of that free blackberry curve offer, since i moved here and don't really want to get a new phone?
4905	good night, b.
4906	i apologize for the misunderstanding. i did not realize i was speeding up through the red light. i promise to be more attentive in future.
4907	B: that's a bold decision. good luck with your travels and job search, i hope you find the opportunity you're looking for. let me know if there's anything i can do to help.
4908	yes, it was quite impressive how quickly and effectively the wrestlers dominated them.
4909	A: thank you for reaching out. b: it was my pleasure.
4910	A: yes, after we move our furniture in, we can finally decorate the house with new curtains and paint the walls.
4911	okay, let me know if you want me to find something more traditional or modern for you.
4912	A: you're welcome. let me know if you need any help with the bouquet.
4913	B: certain factors like political stability, competition in the market, and local preferences might impact sales differently across the countries. beijing, for instance, might have higher sales due to the growing demand for the product in the chinese market. hong kong might perform better due to its connectivity and accessibility to mainland china. in contrast, singapore and tokyo could be influenced by different economic and social values.
4914	B: i'll need five hundred dollars each, so a total of five checks.
4915	A: come on, let's hurry up and play with our barbies before our parents come back.
4916	B: we can schedule the carpet upgrade as soon as the new paint color is approved, and the work can typically be completed within a week. the timing depends on available materials and the availability of the installers.
4917	great. i'll meet you at the store in 10 minutes.
4918	i disagree.
4919	B: playing guitar and writing new songs. what about you?
4920	yes, you can find signs indicating whether the gas station offers full-service or self-service stations with pumps labeled accordingly.
4921	of course, please proceed with the necessary steps for exchanging the money from us dollars to rib, and once that's completed, you will be able to withdraw the entire amount.
4922	sure, i can help with that. please provide me with the date, time, and number of guests so i can book the reservation.
4923	B: definitely agree, but we should also find ways to decrease congestion and encourage more public transportation options.
4924	B: on the whole, i mean he is not the top-performing student, but he consistently ranks among the top in the class, just like the best performers.
4925	A: maybe we should consider consequences and potential risks instead of always focusing on a positive outcome.
4926	B: fair enough, we could always use a checklist to keep our space clean and organized.
4927	B: i would be happy to help you reserve a flight for tomorrow's 2 pm flight.
4928	B: they're really running you into the ground. why don't you ask for some time off? you could take a long weekend and go away somewhere.
4929	B: i have a special event to attend at ______ tonight.
4930	A: alright, thanks for helping me out. can you meet me down at the office to check the fax machine together?
4931	B: sure, five stamps for $1.
4932	A: no problem, i'll assign you a non-smoking room immediately. the doorman will assist you with your luggage.
4933	A: you can try role-playing conversations with other speakers or using language exchange groups to practice english regularly.
4934	A: would you like me to leave a message for him to call you when he returns?
4935	you're welcome. enjoy your stay at the hotel and let us know if you need any assistance.
4936	... they can turn into burnt popcorn.
4937	i don't have enough information on the situation itself, but if you feel like you need to confront her to understand her perspective, you could consider discussing the incident. however, make sure to approach the conversation with an open mind and focus on understanding her actions and feelings rather than getting defensive or angry.
4938	A: let's enjoy some indoor activities today, like playing board games or watching a movie?
4939	A: no, i can't cook either. but i would help you with the dishes if we agree on some takeout dinners together.
4940	B: no, thank you.
4941	thanks for the compliment, i'm excited to attend!
4942	B: i don't think i would visit this restaurant again.
4943	A: in that case, could you please pick up your passport and bring it to us?
4944	B: you're welcome, please repay as soon as possible.
4945	B: i understand your concern, but our comprehensive inspection process ensures that all areas are thoroughly checked and verified for any pest activity. however, if you would like to request a different room, we can surely accommodate that request.
4946	A: found your coat in the lost and found. it was left in the lobby bar.
4947	B: yes, he does.
4948	B: understand the situation. can you provide any alternatives or suggestions on how to proceed?
4949	B: i'm intrigued. let's give it a try and check out the soul food drama together.
4950	B: i'm responsible and know the consequences of deviating from the schedule. but i think keeping track of time during personal hours is unnecessary given i completed my tasks efficiently.
4951	i believe so, b.

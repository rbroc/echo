13	researchers from the university of edinburgh led an international study involving 1,326 older women with early-stage hormone-sensitive breast cancer, who were aged 65 or older and had not had their tumors spread to the lymph nodes beneath the arm. the women underwent breast-conserving surgery to remove their tumors and were then split into two groups: one received hormone treatment and radiation, while the other received only hormone treatment. after five years, approximately 96% of both groups had survived, and most deaths were not caused by breast cancer. however, approximately 1.3% of those given radiation experienced cancer recurrence in the treated breast, compared to 4.1% of those who did not receive radiotherapy. a separate study found that pregnant women were more likely to quit smoking if offered shopping vouchers as part of a treatment plan. the researchers split 612 pregnant smokers into two groups, with half receiving only advice and nicotine replacement therapy, and the other half receiving up to £400 worth of vouchers to spend at certain stores if they quit while pregnant. of the women offered shopping vouchers, 69 quit smoking compared to 26 in the other group, with 15% of the voucher group remaining off cigarettes 12 months post-delivery. however, critics may argue that offering financial incentives amounts to bribery to get mothers to prioritize the health of their children. the edinburgh researchers concluded that, while radiotherapy will remain the standard of care for most women after breast-conserving surgery, the modest reduction in risk of recurrence from radiotherapy in low-risk older women receiving hormone treatment makes omitting radiotherapy an option for carefully selected patients. in the uk, around 50,000 women develop breast cancer each year, with nearly 12,000 deaths annually. radiotherapy is offered to around 35,000 women undergoing breast conserving surgery.

146	a british company, seymourpowell, has developed adjustable plane seats called "morph" that can be customized to fit passenger shapes and sizes. this innovation aims to improve comfort for larger passengers without charging them extra or requiring them to move to business class. families can also enjoy more space as parents can expand their seats while smaller children can have smaller ones. the morph seat design uses a fabric hammock stretched over a frame and adjustable formers for recline, height, depth, and width, ensuring comfort without reducing legroom. the concept has attracted attention from plane manufacturers and promises to provide tailored seats for individual comfort, privacy, or other specific needs. however, it may take more than a decade before these seats are introduced in commercial aircraft, as they'll likely need to be custom-built. additionally, airlines have already adopted seating plans offering increased comfort, such as air new zealand's skycouches and airbus' expanded aisle seats. some experts suggest policies like "fat taxes" or customized pricing based on passenger size could be implemented in the future to accommodate larger passengers.
147	comedian stephen colbert encouraged his fans to make unnecessary edits to the wikipedia pages of possible vice presidential candidates for mitt romney as a way to sway their viability. in response, wikipedia locked the pages of several potential nominees, including tim pawlenty, rob portman, paul ryan, marco rubio, bobby jindal, and chris christie. political analysts have noted that a correlation exists between the number of recent edits to a candidate's page and their likelihood of being chosen as a vice presidential nominee. the trend began in 2008, when there was a significant increase in edits the day before sarah palin and joe biden were announced as their respective parties' vice presidential nominees. while the edit tally may not be an accurate indicator, the romney campaign has asked people to download their app for breaking news on the selection. the system has its limitations, as some edits may be made by individuals with ulterior motives, and the correlation does not account for context or the level of public scrutiny each candidate has faced prior to the potential nomination.

154	tony kirwan, a former electrician from queensland, australia, founded destiny rescue in 2007 after being inspired by a deeply spiritual moment and a trip to cambodia. inspired by the plight of children in sex slavery in asia, kirwan has dedicated his life to rescuing them and providing them with a chance at a normal life. destiny rescue has successfully saved over 2000 children from brothels and sex slavery, with a plan to save 800 more this year. however, the rescue process is complex, as it often involves working with families and police to ensure the children's safety and future. kirwan's ultimate goal is to end child slavery and set up rescue operations in more countries, including china and india. destiny rescue provides education, employment, and emotional support to children to help them reintegrate into their communities. one such success story is srey toun, who was rescued from her abuser at the age of 15 and is now married with a small sewing business in phnom penh employing other rescued girls. kirwan envisions rescuing 100,000 children by 2020.
155	the geneva accord signed by russian foreign minister sergey lavrov on april 17 represents a major stand down by russia in the ongoing crisis in ukraine. however, given russia's past mendacity and slipperiness, the agreement is not binding and could be easily abandoned by president vladimir putin. at a press conference on the same day, putin denied the existence of ukrainians as a separate nation, claiming they are essentially russian. he also reserved the right to intervene in ukraine to defend the rights of russian-speaking citizens and hinted at armed intervention. putin's insistence on helping russian citizens in ukraine spooked ukrainians, especially with the continued massing of russian troops along ukraine's borders. the geneva agreement calls for all illegal armed groups to be disarmed and buildings and streets to be vacated, which applies mainly to the russian-supported commandos in eastern ukraine. while both the united states and ukraine have insisted that russia stick to the agreement, the response has been desultory, with some extremists abandoning buildings and others continuing their activities. it remains to be seen whether russia is serious about the agreement or if it is just a ploy to buy time while preparations for military action continue. some analysts suggest putin may have been influenced by international condemnation of russia's actions in ukraine and crimea and the potential for painful western sanctions. ultimately, the geneva accord provides a standard against which russian actions in ukraine can be measured, and the coming weeks will demonstrate whether russia is committed to de-escalation or further aggression.

189	in calais, france, authorities cleared a migrant camp by force, leaving over a thousand people homeless and determined to reach britain. the camp, which had existed for months, was destroyed in less than two hours, with migrants and their possessions being driven back with shields and batons. the authorities claimed the action was necessary due to an outbreak of scabies, but the migrants saw it as an attempt to end the controversy surrounding their presence. despite the destruction of their camp, the migrants expressed their determination to continue their journey to britain, seeing it as their last hope for a new life. the cycle of arrests, deportations, and harsh conditions had failed to stop the immigration merry-go-round, and calais was expected to once again become a magnet for those seeking to reach the uk. charities and support groups provided food, water, and shelter for the displaced, but the migrants' resolve remained strong, and they were already making plans to return to the area.

191	thousands of gravestones of british and canadian soldiers who died in the liberation of france during world war ii, including those at the cemeteries in bayeux, cinthaux, and ranville, are in need of repair or replacement ahead of the 70th anniversary of d-day. the distinctive white limestone headstones have not been replaced since the end of the war and are now in poor condition, making it impossible to read the soldier's name, regiment insignia, date of death, age, and religion. the queen is expected to attend the commemorations in france next year, and many of the headstones will be destroyed and replaced with marble-like ones from italy. the work is being carried out by french and belgian companies, and the commonwealth war graves commission is responsible for over 3,000 cemeteries in france, with the british government providing most of its budget. the first village to be liberated from the nazis on d-day was ranville, which was freed by the british 13th parachute battalion.
192	pamela young, the mother of a man with asperger's syndrome who was killed with a single punch, criticized the "soft touch" justice system after the court of appeal upheld the four-year sentence for lewis gill, the 21-year-old attacker. young's son, andrew young, died from injuries sustained in an unprovoked attack in bournemouth last november. gill, who has a past criminal record and is a trained boxer, was initially given a four-year term for manslaughter, but the attorney general referred the sentence to the court of appeal due to public concern over its leniency. three senior judges rejected this challenge and maintained that the sentence was reasonable. young expressed disappointment and outrage over the decision, stressing that justice had not been served in her son's case. the incident received widespread media attention and sparked public anger, leading the justice secretary, chris grayling, to announce a full review of manslaughter sentencing guidelines.
193	emotional eating is a common issue where individuals turn to comfort food for emotional reasons, with up to 70% of people engaging in it to some extent. approximately 90% of diets fail due to the return of emotional eating habits. the roots of emotional eating often date back to childhood, where food may have been used as a way to cope with emotional upset or stress. dr. pam spurr suggests becoming aware of emotional eating triggers and developing mindfulness to help overcome this pattern. her book, "the emotional eater's diet," offers strategies for managing emotional eating by focusing on the present moment, avoiding unhealthy snacks, and planning alternate responses to stress. the first step to conquering emotional eating is acknowledging its presence and taking a one-day-at-a-time approach to change. avoid autopilot eating and practice mindful eating by appreciating the moment and savoring each bite.
194	tory ministers maria miller and chris grayling are considering decriminalizing tv licence fee evasion, making it a civil matter instead of a criminal offense. around 180,000 cases related to non-payment end up before magistrates each year, with 155,000 people fined and 70 sent to prison. backbench mps are also supporting decriminalization through the deregulation bill. the bbc is likely to resist this change due to the funding cuts they have already faced and the fear of increased evasion leading to financial losses. chris grayling believes non-payment should be treated like parking tickets and has gained the support of 101 mps. however, culture secretary maria miller may prefer to wait for the upcoming negotiations over the bbc's charter review. a bbc spokesman warns that changing the law could lead to higher evasion and significant financial losses.
195	the police federation chairman, steve white, criticized the government's claims that crime is falling, stating that many crimes go unreported because victims feel nothing will be done. he also condemned the head of the police watchdog for suggesting that police may prioritize more serious offenses over less serious ones. white, who represents over 130,000 rank-and-file officers, highlighted his personal experience when his daughter was a victim of crime and did not report it due to a lack of faith in the police response. the watchdog responded by calling white's comments "regrettably intemperate and wholly misconceived," but agreed that the police need to work smarter due to budget cuts. the ongoing budget cuts have led to over 30,000 officer and staff losses and further job losses are expected. the police watchdog also criticized forces for using outdated methods to deal with modern-day crimes and failing to investigate crimes properly, particularly in larger cities.
196	abu hamza, a radical cleric found guilty on terror charges by a new york federal jury, is likely to spend the rest of his life in a high-security prison. however, stopping high-profile extremist preachers is not enough, as challenging extremist narratives, ideas, and propaganda is necessary to prevent the next generation of extremist preachers from emerging. during the 1980s and early 1990s, extremist preachers like abu hamza played a significant role in recruiting and propagating al-qaeda's worldview to young muslims in europe and north america. though many key extremist preachers have been arrested or deported, extremist narratives continue to be disseminated. to tackle extremism, universities and colleges must not host extremist preachers without a challenge, prisoners need mentoring and support, and online extremism must be countered with counter-arguments. arresting key individuals or shutting down extremist websites are not long-term solutions. extreme islamism relies on a simplistic framework, portraying a west versus islam or muslim versus non-muslim conflict. debunking this framework and revealing the selective nature of extremist arguments is crucial. young people will lose interest in extremism when it becomes unfashionable, but offering alternative narratives and promoting national and regional identity are necessary for this to occur.

283	the northeastern quadrant of the united states has experienced the coldest weather in about 20 years, with dangerously low temperatures in the midwest and wild weather on the coast. this extreme weather is a normal occurrence in the midlatitudes where cold and warm air cannot easily mix, resulting in the jet stream, a fast air current separating warm and cold air. however, the jet stream can undulate and form high and low-pressure systems, leading to temperature contrasts and severe weather events. the current weather situation is more extreme due to a distorted jet stream bringing polar air farther south than usual. while this cold snap does not contradict the fact of global warming, some scientists argue that weakened temperature contrasts due to warming could cause more frequent and intense winter storms. the relationship between long-term climate changes and short-term extreme weather events is still a topic of ongoing research and debate.

300	in a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have revised 200 million years of geologic history in the western united states by identifying multiple hidden tectonic plates deep within the earth's mantle. this new finding challenges the previously accepted theory that north america's mountainous west was formed by the movement of the undersea farallon plate. using seismic tomography and powerful computers, a research group at ludwig maximilian university in munich and the british columbia geological survey discovered several plates, including the angayucham and mezcalera plates, which they believe existed beneath long-vanished seas and played a role in forming the mountainous ridges of the western u.s. the plates, which are colder and denser than the surrounding mantle rock, were hidden because of the need for powerful computers and advanced seismic monitoring equipment, both of which have only been available in the last decade. the study was published in the journal nature.

302	according to a map created by the us government's climate team using data from rutgers snow lab and noaa satellite images, there have been more white christmases (more snow-covered days during the week of christmas) in the us between 1990 and 2013 compared to 1966 to 1989. however, this trend only applies to certain areas, as indicated by the blue colors on the map where snow-covered days have increased up to 25%, and brown colors where they have decreased up to 25%. the overall increase in snow extent during the holiday week has been modest, but it varies greatly from place to place. according to the rutgers snow lab, northern hemisphere snow cover is declining significantly at the end of the cold season, which could have implications for global warming and a potential feed-back effect. the scientists emphasize that looking at a particular winter week for snow extent changes is not a meaningful indicator of long-term climate change and suggest focusing on monthly or seasonal averages instead.

422	a new documentary, "dead famous dna," claims that elvis presley's premature death may have been caused by an undiagnosed genetic condition rather than his lifestyle alone. scientists analyzed a sample of elvis' hair and found evidence of a gene mutation linked to heart muscle disease, obesity, glaucoma, and migraines. elvis, who suffered from addiction to junk food and prescription drugs, died of cardiac arrhythmia at age 42. the scientists extracted nearly 90% of elvis' genome, which revealed four major chromosome mutations. one mutation was linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which may have contributed to his symptoms such as irregular heartbeat, fatigue, and fainting. the documentary sheds light on elvis' early death and challenges the common belief that his lifestyle was solely to blame.
423	tetris, celebrated on its 30th anniversary on june 6 as world tetris day, is a popular game that hooks players with the satisfaction of tidying up and completing perpetual uncompleted tasks. dr. tom stafford, a psychologist from the university of sheffield, explains the game takes advantage of the zeigarnik effect, where unfinished tasks are easier to remember than completed ones. most players use visual comparison to fit falling shapes into rows rather than mentally rotating them, as it is more efficient and aligns with the principle of "thinking with it" rather than "thinking about it." this epistemic action keeps players immersed and addicted to the perpetual loop of completing and generating new tasks. tetris, the "granddaddy of addictive puzzle games," proves that graphics and realism are not essential for game addiction.

427	former tennessee senator howard baker, who passed away recently, is best known for asking the vital question during the watergate scandal: "what did the president know and when did he know it?" the scandal, which began with a break-in at the democratic national committee headquarters in 1972 and subsequent obstruction of justice attempts, led to the supreme court ordering the release of white house recordings and the house judiciary committee's approval of three articles of impeachment against president richard nixon. the era was marked by intense distrust towards the government, revealed through the daily unfolding of the sordid activities of the nixon administration. in his book "the invisible bridge," author rick perlstein details the impact of watergate on american politics, which continues to reverberate through the political spectrum. for both democrats and republicans, the scandal has shaped the way they approach governance, as they grapple with the public's lack of trust in elected officials. political scandals continue to take up the washington's attention, sometimes leading to much-needed reforms but also diverting it from major issues. watergate's enduring legacy is a profound distrust of the government and the resulting decline in public faith. reforms, such as stricter campaign finance regulations and stricter restrictions on the revolving door between government and lobbying, are considered essential to rebuild trust in government.
428	danny blanchflower, who passed away 21 years ago, is best remembered for his observation that "the game is about glory. it's about doing things in style, with a flourish, about going out and beating the other lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom." this belief, shared by various revered figures in sport, including sir alex ferguson and brian clough, was considered romantic and idealistic by some, but essential to the spirit of sport. sport has been described as a "glorious irrelevance," and while it may seem trivial, it generates a sense of wonder and peak experiences for many. however, sport also faces challenges such as the use of performance-enhancing drugs and the concentration of wealth in certain leagues and sports. despite these issues, the majesty and brilliance of athletes and teams throughout history continue to make sport a worthwhile pursuit.

441	a recent discovery of new craters in siberia and "vast methane plumes" in the arctic ocean raise concerns about the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from thawing permafrost and collapsing methane hydrates. the released methane contributes to global warming, with airborne methane producing 86 times the heat-trapping effect of carbon dioxide. this process, known as a positive feedback loop, is escalating as warmer temperatures cause more methane to be released, which in turn leads to more warming. the increase in atmospheric methane started with human activities, primarily burning fossil fuels and extracting natural gas through fracking, which results in methane leaks. to reduce methane emissions and mitigate the consequences, individuals and governments need to acknowledge the human role in causing this issue and invest in cleaner energy alternatives, such as wind and solar power, instead of relying on natural gas.
442	silver could significantly increase the effectiveness of antibiotics against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. in experiments on mice, giving silver with antibiotics made them ten to a thousand times more effective. professors dame sally davies and jim collins have warned of the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, which could leave millions vulnerable to untreatable bugs. silver, with its long-known antibacterial properties, is generally ineffective when used alone due to high doses required which can be poisonous. the recent study suggests using silver in small amounts with existing antibiotics is safe and may revolutionize antibiotic treatment by enhancing their effectiveness against antibiotic-resistant strains. the researchers from boston university discovered that silver makes bacteria more permeable, allowing antibiotics to enter and kill them, as well as aiding the production of reactive oxygen molecules that help in bacterial death. this approach to antibiotic development could potentially tackle various infections, including stomach bugs, urinary tract infections, and films of bacteria on catheters.

444	water companies in the uk have imposed an 11-point restricted list to prevent 20 million people from exploiting loopholes during a hosepipe ban due to the drought-hit south and eastern regions. the ban includes using a hose or sprinkler to water plants, wash cars or boats, fill swimming pools, and clean patios, driveways, or windows. even keeping children cool with a hose or spraying them will be prohibited, with a £1,000 fine for violations. seven water companies, including anglian water, southern, southeast, thames, veolia southeast, veolia central, and sutton and east surrey water, have announced the temporary ban starting from april 5. the rules aim to close loopholes following accusations of cheating during the last hosepipe ban in 2006. the restrictions are necessary due to two years of chronically low rainfall that has left rivers dry and reservoirs at record low levels. the environment agency warned that without persistent above-average rainfall, the unpopular measures could last until the end of the summer, and more water companies and industries may be affected. forecasters predict low chances of heavy rain between march and may, and groundwater levels are lower than during the 1976 drought when taps were switched off in some cities. consumers' water use at home could lead to further economic consequences if not reduced.
445	on the 25th anniversary of the river thames marchioness pleasure boat tragedy that claimed the lives of 51 young people, their families and some survivors gathered at southwark cathedral in london to remember them. the names of the victims were read out, and flowers and candles were placed in their memory. the disaster occurred on august 20, 1989, when the marchioness collided with the dredger bowbelle and sank. among those who died was francesca dallaglio, the sister of former england rugby captain lawrence dallaglio, and antonio de vasconcellos, whose 26th birthday was being celebrated aboard the boat. the cathedral was filled with red roses and candles in honor of each victim, and representatives from the royal national lifeboat institution and port of london authority attended the service. families placed flowers at the spot on the river where the accident happened. it took ten years for a public inquiry to be held into the disaster following the first report from the marine accident investigation branch, which stated that both vessels failed to mount a proper look-out. however, critics felt that the report did not go far enough in assigning blame, leading to the eventual public inquiry in 2001. the inquiry concluded that the disaster was 'a catastrophe that should never have happened.' the families also had to cope with the decision to cut off the hands of more than 20 victims for identification purposes and criticism of the conduct of the captains and owners of the vessels. in 1996, the crown prosecution service determined that there was insufficient evidence to bring any further criminal proceedings against the captains.
446	protesters demonstrated outside the metropolitan opera against the production of john adams' opera "the death of klinghoffer," which dramatizes the hijacking of a cruise ship in 1985 and the subsequent killing of a jewish american passenger, leon klinghoffer. former mayor rudolph giuliani and others attended a rally against the opera, while 100 protesters sat in wheelchairs in front of the opera house in solidarity with klinghoffer. inside, some attendees disrupted the performance with shouts and heckling, leading to one arrest for disorderly conduct. the opera's depiction of the palestinians liberation front and their actions was criticized by some as making "false moral equivalencies" and legitimizing terrorism. the met's general manager, peter gelb, was a target of the protests and accusations of taking money from terrorists. klinghoffer's daughters have also decried the opera as romanticizing their father's murder. the met originally planned to broadcast the opera live in november but cancelled the broadcast after pressure from jewish groups fearing it could fuel antisemitism. the opera does not absolve the killers and ends with marilyn klinghoffer condemning both her husband's killers and the captain for accommodating them.

500	the ongoing debate in the u.s. congress over the gop's attempt to repeal the affordable care act (aca) and the naacp's response to mitt romney's proposal to eliminate a "nonessential" obamacare program highlights the deep divide in america over healthcare. in contrast, brazil has a long-standing commitment to universal healthcare as a fundamental human right, with everyone expected to contribute. the sistema único de saúde (sus) is funded through various taxes at different government levels and is decentralized, involving state and municipal governments in policy-making. brazil's healthcare system has improved life expectancy significantly but faces challenges, including insufficient funding, access to care in challenging areas, and shortages of healthcare personnel and infrastructure. brazil's commitment to healthcare as a shared responsibility is rooted in its history of social and political activism and has gained popular support. the u.s. could learn from brazil's approach by putting aside differences over the aca and viewing it as a shared responsibility and human right. despite sus's challenges, it serves as an example of the importance of ensuring a robust healthcare system for its citizens.

566	mark noble, a midfielder for west ham united, is considering representing the republic of ireland at international level after being overlooked by england manager roy hodgson. noble, who was born in london but qualifies for ireland through his paternal grandparents, has been pursued by ireland manager martin o'neill since he took over last november. o'neill wants to bring noble into the irish squad for euro 2016 qualifying to add depth to his midfield options. noble was named west ham's player of the year last season and was expected to be included in england's squad for recent friendlies, but instead jack colback and fabian delph were selected. noble has played for england at youth levels, including representing the under-21 team and captaining them to the european championships final in 2009, but a switch to ireland would require him to obtain a passport. o'neill is confident he can convince noble to play for ireland and he would provide a strong central midfield partnership with james mccarthy if he pledges allegiance to the irish team. noble, who has scored 33 goals in 287 appearances for west ham, also attracted interest from sunderland and newcastle this summer. england captain wayne rooney was named in the recent england squad.

568	prime minister david cameron is set to deploy british intelligence, spy planes, drones, and special forces to mali to assist france in finding and dismantling the al qaeda network behind the algerian hostage crisis. the uk is also considering offering support by refueling french fighter aircraft and training malian troops. cameron called the ideology behind the terror attacks a "poisonous thinking" that requires a "generational struggle" to defeat. the prime minister's decision comes after at least 37 foreign hostages, including britons paul morgan, kenneth whiteside, garry barlow, and carlos estrada, were killed during the attack at the in amenas gas facility. cameron expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to bring the deceased home for identification as soon as possible. he acknowledged the challenges algeria faced in dealing with over 30 terrorists and praised their resolve in undertaking the rescue attempt. labor leader ed miliband denounced the attack as "pre-meditated, cold-blooded murder" and a new threat to the west, urging a "decisive and coordinated international response." cameron also promised to put counter-terrorism at the top of the g8 agenda during the uk's chairmanship this year.

571	a long-haul bus can carry as many passengers as a domestic airline flight, yet safety regulations and oversight for buses, particularly for drivers, lag behind those for airlines. according to deborah hersman, chairman of the national transportation safety board, hours-of-service violations and tired drivers are common issues in the motor coach industry. the recent grounding of the boeing 787 dreamliner and fatal bus crashes have brought attention to the need for stricter regulations and penalties for bus companies. despite these concerns, authorities continue to let companies operate even after citations for violations. with approximately 700 million passengers annually, the motor coach industry, which has experienced several fatal accidents in recent years, needs greater focus from regulators, according to the american bus association. only 20 percent of trucks and buses undergo inspections, and 7 percent of drivers are pulled off the road due to hours-of-service violations or other issues. the motor carrier safety administration defends its practices and states that federal and state inspectors conduct millions of inspections each year, pulling out-of-service vehicles and drivers with serious safety violations. however, hersman believes that more needs to be done to address the rampant violation of federal safety rules within the industry.

577	an 85-year-old man died less than 48 hours after being evacuated from merok park care home in surrey due to concerns for residents' safety. the man, who is survived by a widow, a son, two daughters, seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren, was moved to warrengate nursing home in a chaotic evacuation process. residents were reportedly carried from their beds in nightclothes and belongings were moved in bin liners. the care home, owned by mauritian businessman soodressen cooppen and his wife maleenee, has been described as a 'dump' by families and was previously criticized for failing to keep proper records. the death has led to calls for an investigation into the care home owners and concerns about the conditions in other homes they own. another home, grantley court in sutton, was also evacuated due to similar issues. zeenat mehboob rajan, director of claremont care services which owns warrengate, said moving elderly people could cause premature death and the man may have died sooner if he hadn't been moved. the man's family and other residents have complained about the sudden evacuation and lack of information provided by the authorities. it is believed that staff at merok park were working up to 60 hours per week and had not received relevant training. the care quality commission (cqc) carried out a comprehensive inspection of merok park on november 28 and december 1 and decided that the care facility had to close immediately due to unsanitary conditions and residents being forced to wash in cold water by untrained staff. surrey police assisted with the closure and removing residents. merok park was given a clean bill of health by the cqc in january despite numerous complaints going back years. the cooppens, who live in a £2million house in cheam, own a third care home, faygate house in sutton, which was also criticized by the inspectorate earlier this year.
578	in september 2014, human rights attorney amal alamuddin, who had married actor george clooney, changed her professional name to amal clooney. this decision sparked controversy and criticism from some, with some people accusing her of being anti-feminist or anti-progressive for taking on her husband's name. critics argued that it was a regressive step for a strong, career-driven woman to do so, and that it set a bad example for other women. however, others defended amal's decision as a personal choice that did not negate her accomplishments or independence. the debate highlights the ongoing tension around women's names and identity, and the unfair pressure placed on women who reach high levels of success to serve as symbols of feminist progress. ultimately, amal's name change does not determine her worth as a person or her feminist credentials.

599	the european commission is providing £1,000 in taxpayer funds to thousands of unemployed europeans, aged 18 to 30, to travel to and secure jobs in the uk under the 'your first eures job' scheme. critics argue this scheme is controversial given the high unemployment rate among young britons, which is over 1 million. the scheme, currently being piloted in spain, aims to match jobseekers with suitable jobs and will be expanded across the eu. the eu aims to help employers access workforce they cannot find locally, but critics fear an influx of young unemployed europeans from countries with high unemployment like spain and greece. prime minister david cameron has previously expressed concern about the free movement of workers from eu countries to the uk. the uk has 2.53 million unemployed persons, including nearly one million jobless young adults, and long-term youth unemployment has been steadily increasing. tim aker from the get britain out campaign expressed concern about the taxpayer funding and undercutting british workers. the department for work and pensions stated that the scheme also applies to young british citizens moving to other eu countries.
600	a golden coach, named britannia, built by australian man jim frecklington as a gift for the queen's 80th birthday in 2006, was the center of a political controversy after it remained idle in a suburban sydney workshop for almost a decade. the coach, which cost millions and contained historical items, was meant to be a successor to the australian state coach frecklington had built in 1988 for queen elizabeth ii. however, the second coach was delayed numerous times and became a white elephant amidst accusations of misuse of taxpayer dollars. the coach, which features items from various historic sites and significant objects, was eventually shipped to the uk and plans are being made for its use by the royal family. the coach was funded in part by a taxpayer-funded grant from a former conservative australian prime minister. frecklington, a former royal household employee, claimed the coach would be delivered for the queen's diamond jubilee in 2012 or the birth of prince george in 2013. the coach's delayed delivery and its status as a private initiative rather than a royal commission caused debate in the australian parliament.
601	angel di maria, a argentine winger for real madrid, had a remarkable year on the pitch, helping the team win the champions league, and was named man-of-the-match in the final. however, his personal life off the field was even more inspiring. his wife, jorgelina cardoso, had faced pregnancy complications the previous year, and their daughter, mia, was born three months premature. di maria missed a crucial champions league game to be with his wife, and his daughter spent two months in intensive care before being allowed to go home. after mia's recovery, di maria returned to football, but found himself on the bench due to real's signing of gareth bale. di maria has described his daughter's battle for survival as the 'game of his life.' he dedicated his goal against switzerland in the world cup to his family and proudly wears a shirt with 'papa 7' on the back for his daughter. the year before, real boss carlo ancelotti had requested di maria's signing, but the wages offered were low, and the club's reluctance to increase them led to di maria's transfer to manchester united for £59.7 million. di maria is known for his long, wiry physique and endurance on the field. he is versatile and able to play various positions. his father, miguel, quit football due to a knee injury and delivered coal to make ends meet. angel's mother, diana, took him to training sessions by bicycle, and the family's stamina runs in their blood. mia, who celebrates her first birthday this year, has inspired di maria with her determination to survive against all odds. di maria's transfer from real madrid to manchester united is controversial and unpopular with fans, but if he produces moments like the champions league-winning assist for bale, he will be welcomed as a valuable addition to the team.

633	stéphane malka, a french architect and former graffiti artist, has transformed 23 homeless shelters into pods attached to the side of marseille's railroad station. the pods, called a-kamp47, are safe for now due to a french rule that prohibits taking people off the streets during winter months. malka's design, inspired by the city's gun violence problem, was erected in 12 hours and includes thermal blankets and storage space. the pods, which can house up to 47 people, are part of a series of similar projects for malka's book, le petit pari(s), coming out next year. malka intended for the pods to increase visibility of the housing crisis and inspire architects to focus on community-minded projects. however, the pods have mostly been used by young travelers rather than locals. despite this, malka hopes the structures will inspire change within the housing system, given the increasing number of climate and political refugees.
634	an internal air force review revealed that security forces at malmstrom air force base in montana failed to effectively respond to a simulated hostile takeover of a nuclear missile silo during a drill last summer. the security team's inability to regain control of the captured nuclear weapon caused the base to fail its broader safety and security inspection. the document obtained through a freedom of information act request cited insufficient training and leadership culture as the underlying causes of the issue. the failure was one of several setbacks for the nuclear missile corps revealed over the past year, which included leadership and training lapses, breakdowns in discipline, and morale problems. defense secretary chuck hagel ordered two parallel nuclear reviews to address these concerns. the air force declined to provide further details about the exercise scenario or response tactics, stating that it could compromise security. the corrective measures included arranging for recapture exercises and more closely tracking lessons learned. the inspection failure occurred during an evaluation designed to ensure the proper control of nuclear weapons. security forces are responsible for various protective roles on the air force's three nuclear missile bases, including along roads used to transport missiles and warheads, at weapons storage facilities, and at launch silos and control centers.
635	great tits, birds that peck open milk bottles for cream, are the last surviving animals exhibiting one of the earliest known examples of culture in animals aside from humans. scientists at the university of oxford and lund university have discovered that not only do great tits pass down traditions through generations, but they also adapt to fit the local area. this is the first evidence of cultural conformity, a key factor in the development of complex culture among humans, found in any wild animals besides primates. female great tits are more skilled at remembering food cache locations and retrieving them, even pilfering from males, according to a study in behavioral ecology and sociobiology. great tits have learned to open puzzle boxes from observing each other in the wild and pass on these learned behaviors through generations. the birds conform to local traditions when they move between populations, allowing each population to maintain its unique customs despite migration. this finding challenges previous beliefs that conformist behavior was only seen in primates. the puzzle-solving experiments conducted in wytham wood in oxford revealed that birds favored the method they learned from innovator birds in their area, and even birds that had migrated between populations adopted local traditions rather than their own. these findings may explain why raiding milk bottles by pecking through the foil tops, a behavior first noticed in the 1920s in the uk, persisted for so long. the experiments suggest that birds can learn through observation and create arbitrary local cultural traditions, even though these traditions have no survival benefits, they may persist over years.
636	kate middleton attended the annual diplomatic reception at buckingham palace, the largest gathering the monarch holds each year. for the first time since her wedding in 2011, she wore a dazzling tiara, believed to be loaned to her by the queen from the collection of princess margaret. the delicate diamond tiara, made from a dismantled necklace gifted to the queen mother, is adorned with pearls and dates back to the 1930s. kate wore an alexander mcqueen evening gown and looked regal with her long hair styled to show off the tiara. this was a "three-line whip" event for william and kate, as they usually avoid attending state banquets. the reception allows members of the royal family to meet and greet the 172 foreign missions accredited to the court of st. james's in london.
637	raheem sterling was sent off in england's draw with ecuador, missing the final warm-up game against honduras. the liverpool forward made a reckless challenge on antonio valencia, sparking a late brawl. valencia reacted aggressively due to fears of injuries after teammate secondo castillo nearly missed out on the world cup due to injury. both players were shown red cards, with england manager roy hodgson expressing disappointment over the incidents.
638	federal agents, equipped with body armor and breathing apparatus, raided the home of kevin curtis in corinth, mississippi, after he was charged with sending letters laced with the poison ricin to president barack obama and senator roger wicker. curtis is also an elvis impersonator. the heavily-armed agents took extreme precautions due to the potential danger of contamination. curtis is believed to have sent the poisoned letters just one day after the boston bombings. he had previously sent letters to wicker and had been identified as a potential threat because of the frequency of his correspondence. curtis is accused of writing about a conspiracy to sell body parts on the black market and had spoken of issues with a cleaning business. the raid and the alleged ricin plot have left the country on a high state of alert. the letters intercepted at a mail screening facility in maryland contained the same message, 'to see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance.' and the signature 'i am kc and i approve this message.' the findings of the field tests are not definitive and further analysis is being conducted at an accredited laboratory. more letters may still be received as the investigation continues and there is no indication of a connection to the boston bombings.
639	members of iraq's yazidi minority have carried out revenge attacks on sunni muslim villagers in sinjar, leaving at least 21 people dead and 17 missing. the yazidis, whose ancient religion is a blend of zoroastrianism, christianity, and islam, suffered greatly during islamic state's (isis) offensive last year, with hundreds killed, thousands captured, and raped. now, as some yazidis return to their homes, they have uncovered mass graves and accused sunni villagers of helping isis commit atrocities against the yazidi community. arabs in the affected villages claim that heavily armed yazidi groups have raided their villages, while the identity of the yazidi assailants remains unclear. these violent reprisals highlight the deep divisions between communities that had coexisted for decades and the risk of further violence as other groups displaced by isis, such as shi'ite turkmens, shabak, christians, and kakais, return home. the attacks also underscore the challenges facing iraq as it attempts to recover from isis's brutal rule.
640	a spanish man, 25, was ordered by a judge to leave his parents' home in malaga and find a job after he took them to court for stopping his monthly allowance of $588. the judge ruled that the man, who was studying law but not making progress, should make an effort to find employment within 30 days. the family court also ordered the parents to pay them $292 per month for food expenses for the next two years and take over the son's car repayments. the situation at home had become tense with physical and verbal altercations between the son and his parents. in spain, it is common for young adults to live with their parents well into their 30s due to high youth unemployment, with 4.6 million unemployed and 1.3 million homes having no one in work.
641	tory peer lord ashcroft shared a risqué image of a naked woman with a seagull covering her modesty on his twitter feed, causing some confusion as to whether it was a pigeon as he captioned it. in a follow-up post, he stated that he was in a good mood and clarified that it was indeed a seagull in the image. ashcroft, who was the deputy chairman of the conservative party from 2005 to 2010, has since continued to conduct political polling and was knighted in 2000 and became a member of the house of lords. he has not yet commented on the incident when contacted by mailonline.
642	president barack obama announced on friday that ash carter is his nominee to replace outgoing defense secretary chuck hagel. carter, a national security veteran with over 30 years of experience, expressed his honor and privilege at being nominated. hagel, who was scheduled to attend the ceremony, decided not to attend to focus on carter and his appointment. carter, a decorated official and former deputy defense secretary, has a long list of academic achievements and has been unanimously confirmed by the senate before. republican and democratic lawmakers have expressed support for his nomination.
643	a united airlines flight from honolulu to guam was forced to make an emergency landing on midway island on friday due to an electrical odor on board, according to the federal aviation administration (faa). the boeing 777 plane, carrying 335 passengers and 13 crew members, experienced electrical issues that caused the failure of radar and other systems, according to a passenger. the incident was described as an odor in the cabin by united spokeswoman mary clark, but some passengers reported smoke in the cockpit. passengers spent seven hours on midway island before a replacement aircraft took them back to hawaii. united is investigating the plane, which the spokeswoman described as one of the most sophisticated in aviation. in the meantime, passengers criticized the airline for letting the flight depart despite the reported issue before it was diverted. passengers were told of the odor in the cockpit before takeoff but some left the plane while others, including a family of 25 people, decided to stay. a video showed passengers fanning themselves with paper inside the cabin after the landing and later traveling to a gymnasium on the island where they slept on the floor. the passengers finally reached guam on a replacement flight on saturday. the faa described the odor aboard the plane as an "electrical smell" in the cabin or cockpit.
644	burnley have signed steven reid, a free agent and former blackburn defender, on a one-year deal for the forthcoming premier league season. the 33-year-old veteran, who previously played for west bromwich albion, has 185 top-flight appearances under his belt. manager sean dyche was impressed with reid's professionalism, having played alongside him at millwall, and sees his experience as beneficial for the team's pursuit of premier league safety. reid made his professional debut with millwall before joining blackburn in 2003, spending seven years there before loan spells at qpr and west brom, and eventually signing for west brom in 2010. burnley are currently in a busy summer transfer window, already securing deals for five players, including reid, michael kightly, matt gilks, marvin sordell, and matt taylor. reid began his career with millwall.
645	the u.s. commission on international religious freedom (uscirf) released a report on tuesday detailing ongoing "severe abuses" against religious minorities in iraq, including christians, chaldo-assyrians, sabean-mandaeans, and yazidis. the commission called for the u.s. state department to designate iraq as a "country of particular concern," allowing for policy responses such as public condemnations and potential sanctions. the smaller religious groups lack protection and have faced disproportionate attacks, with christians, mandaeans, and yazidis seriously threatened with extinction. the commission also urged the incoming biden administration to ensure safe and fair provincial elections, prioritize preventing religious abuse, and address the displaced persons and refugee problem. the iraqi constitution gives islam preferred status, potentially justifying religious discrimination against non-muslims. uscirf cited examples of anti-christian violence in mosul and election intimidation in nineveh province.
646	the annual mipim property conference in cannes, france, attracts investors, developers, and government officials from around the world. this year, over 235 local council representatives from the united kingdom attended, sparking criticism as a "taxpayer-funded jolly." the event, which runs from tuesday to friday, included champagne receptions on yachts, lavish business lunches, and late-night partying. officials from some councils, such as leicester and leicestershire enterprise partnership, derby, derbyshire, nottingham and nottinghamshire, sheffield city council, and sheffield city region, sent large delegations. the total cost to the taxpayer for manchester's attendance was reported to be £50,000, with the return in private sector support claimed to be five times higher. some critics argue that the conference is a waste of taxpayer money, particularly amid rising taxes and budget cuts. despite the controversy, attendees continued to enjoy the sun, sea views, and networking opportunities.
647	a spanish politician, angel carromero, was sentenced to four years in prison in cuba for reckless driving resulting in the death of two cuban dissidents, oswaldo paya and harold cepero, in july. paya was a prominent activist challenging the cuban government, and his death prompted an outpouring of grief and questioning of the circumstances surrounding the crash. paya's widow, ofelia acevedo, accused the government of targeting paya for his opposition work and believed the crash was deliberate. the spanish embassy in cuba declined to comment on the sentencing. carromero's traveling companions, including swedish politician aron modig, also survived the crash but had no recollection of how it occurred.
648	hundreds of jobs are under threat at three bae systems shipyards in the uk, with some estimates suggesting over 1,000 jobs may be lost. the future of the yards has been uncertain for months, as the completion of two aircraft carriers has raised concerns about a lack of new work. union leaders met with defence chiefs to discuss the potential job losses and the future of the industry. the company is expected to announce the cuts as early as the next day. the govan and scotstoun yards in scotland are politically sensitive ahead of next year's scottish independence referendum. the type 26 global combat ship could keep work going at the yards, but it is not yet clear which base will build the vessel. scotland's finance secretary and union leaders are seeking clarification on the situation. the labour party's shadow defence secretary expressed concern over the potential impact on the workforce and the future of shipbuilding and the uk's defense. bae systems began a review of its defense work 18 months ago.
649	a new report from the national institute for health and clinical excellence (nice) criticizes insensitive treatment of women who experience miscarriages in the uk's national health service (nhs). women are often left to wait in wards where they can hear others giving birth, and are dealt with by insensitive doctors, nurses, and receptionists. nice urges hospitals to provide more "pregnancy assessment services," offer pregnancy tests in routine appointments, and offer care outside of regular business hours. they also recommend second scans to confirm a fetal demise and new guidelines for treating ectopic pregnancies, which can be confusing for doctors and lead to unnecessary abortions. the report also suggests measures to ensure patients are treated with dignity and respect during this distressing time. around one in five pregnancies end in miscarriage, and around one in five women in england experience miscarriage each year. the report includes recommendations from the birth trauma association and gynaecology specialist professor mary ann lumsden. health minister dan poulter has acknowledged the need for improved care for pregnant women.
650	a new television advert for beagle street life insurance has drawn criticism from parents for its disturbing content. the advert features a monster urinating on a customer in a bath before transforming into a cuddly creature. the commercial was broadcast during daytime and early evening hours, leading to over 50 complaints to the advertising standards agency (asa). the advert was shown on various channels, including during family-friendly programming. many parents reported that their children were frightened by the ad and had nightmares, causing concerns about its suitability for daytime viewing. beagle street claims the campaign is aimed at engaging with a new generation of customers who don't have or understand life insurance and is a "cheeky dig" at traditional insurance methods. however, some viewers found the advert offensive and inappropriate for children and called for it to be banned. the asa has received 55 complaints and is currently investigating the matter.
651	lawrence wilkerson, former chief of staff to colin powell, accused the republican party and one of mitt romney's top aides, john sununu, of racism over sununu's comment that powell endorsed president obama due to their shared race. wilkerson appeared on ed schultz's msnbc show and boldly stated that "my party is full of racists." the dispute follows sununu's remarks suggesting that powell's endorsement was not based on policy issues but skin color. this controversy comes amid increasing polarization along racial lines in the 2012 presidential race, with obama's support among white voters dwindling compared to 2008. the washington post tracking poll revealed that obama's share among white voters had dropped from 43% to 37%, leaving him 23 points behind romney in this demographic. obama and sununu dismissed the racially charged comment, but the controversy sparked outrage within the democratic camp just hours before a new poll showed a widening black-white divide in the highly contested election.
652	ben treuhaft, a 66-year-old pensioner and pianist, has set up a tent on portobello beach in edinburgh after being kicked out of his house by his wife. his mother, jessica mitford, was one of the mitford sisters, known for their scandalous lifestyles in british society during the 1930s. two of jessica's sisters, unity and diana, were fascists who met with adolf hitler and married fascist leaders. ben, a trained piano tuner, has faced an eviction notice from edinburgh city council due to breaching management rules against camping within one mile of a public road. he has vowed to fight the eviction and plans to replace his old piano with a larger one, making it harder for the council to remove. despite facing eviction, ben remains hopeful and wants the community's support to keep playing the piano on the beach for the public. ben has an intriguing family history, with his mother being one of the infamous mitford sisters.
653	britain is experiencing a surge in the construction of wind turbines, making it the third-highest wind power generator in europe with 8.4 gigawatts of capacity. this trend is attributed to the planned cut in subsidies for onshore wind energy, scheduled for april. over 1,200 turbines are set to be built this year, with an additional 7,843 having approval but yet to be constructed. the uk wind power generated by the 4,369 operational turbines is sufficient to power over 4.6 million homes. the government aims to quadruple wind capacity by 2020 and attract significant investment, but clear political support is necessary. meanwhile, small-scale wind turbines and wind farms increased by 50% last year, with some contested due to their visual impact. a 115ft wind turbine in devon was recently destroyed by high winds, raising concerns about the sustainability and cost-effectiveness of the industry.
654	juncture's £2million bid to secure manchester united's patrice evra is ongoing despite louis van gaal's desire to keep him, with the french left-back's wife allegedly pushing for a move. juventus will offer evra a two-year deal worth £55,000-a-week after tax. manchester united are also considering signing juventus midfielder arturo vidal for around £37m, but are currently far from reaching an agreement. meanwhile, united have made tentative enquiries about wolfsburg's ricardo rodriguez as an alternative to evra, with liverpool also considered a suitor for the swiss international defender.
655	patrick stewart, known for his roles in "star trek: the next generation" and other productions, has been knighted by queen elizabeth ii in the new year honors list for services to drama. ross brawn, the formula 1 racing team boss, will receive an officer of the order of the british empire (obe) for his contributions to the sport. jenson button, a formula 1 racing driver who races with brawn's team, will receive a member of the order of the british empire (mbe). british designers amanda wakeley, cath kidston, and luella bartley, and restaurateurs rose gray and ruth rogers, also made the list for their accomplishments in their respective fields. the honors, awarded twice a year, recognize service and achievement and are considered a significant honor for british citizens, with a knighthood being the highest title, making the recipient a "sir" or "dame."
656	a bank manager, debra cox, and her mother, carol collier, have been sentenced to four years and 15 months in prison, respectively, for defrauding cox's friends and family of £200,000. cox had secretly applied for personal loans and mortgages in the names of her in-laws and transferred the funds into collier's account. the pair used the money to fund their 'happy life' with luxurious holidays. cox was dismissed from her job at hsbc for gross misconduct in 2010, after which her ex-husband reported suspicious transactions on his family's accounts. hsbc reimbursed the victims of the fraud, which occurred between october 2006 and june 2010. cox's defense argued that she was trying to buy her way to a happy life, while collier's defense stated that she was unaware of the fraud and was only a willing recipient of the money.
657	entrepreneur rob law, who turned down by investors on dragon's den in 2006, faced a legal dispute after a rival company, pms international, began marketing a children's ride-on suitcase, the kiddee case, with a similar design to his successful trunki suitcase. the appeal court ruled that the kiddee case's "softer and more rounded" shape differed significantly from the trunki's "sleek and stylised" design, and that the possibility of parental confusion was slight. law, who employs over 50 people and enjoys a turnover of over £7 million a year, was disappointed as the decision effectively opens up the european market to the discount competitor. law, a former northumbria university student, was inspired to design the trunki after visiting a toy shop and won the 1998 materials design award. the trunki, which can be ridden like a toy and sells in 97 countries, won a top prize at the national business awards in 2012. pms argued that the trunki's design rights were invalidated by publicity from the 1998 award ceremony, but the court ruled that the differences in shape, decoration, and color meant that the confusion risk was minimal.
658	rufus hound, a comedian and bbc radio 4 presenter, has come under criticism after making controversial comments towards british prime minister david cameron and health secretary jeremy hunt in a blog post. in the post, titled "david and jeremy want your kids to die (unless you’re rich)," hound accused the politicians of wanting to privatize the national health service (nhs) and sell it off to wealthy donors, implying they don't care about the health of the average person. the comments drew outcry from politicians, with tory mp rob wilson labeling the remarks as "disgusting and crass." hound's blog post came shortly after he announced his candidacy for the european parliament elections on a platform of opposing nhs privatization. his comments did not sit well with the public, and despite criticism on social media, hound refused to apologize. hound's comments were not made on behalf of the bbc, as he is a freelancer and not an employee, and his personal views on his blog are not the corporation's responsibility, according to a bbc spokesman. cameron's son ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and a rare form of epilepsy, died at the age of six in 2009, and cameron has publicly expressed his gratitude to nhs staff for his son's care.
659	edvard snowden, the american intelligence leaker currently residing in russia, has revealed that he has received threats against his life. in an interview with a german tv channel, he claimed that unnamed us government officials have expressed a desire to kill him. these threats come after a buzzfeed article quoting anonymous sources from the pentagon and the nsa stating that they would like to see snowden dead or harmed. snowden, who is wanted on treason charges for leaking classified information about us and british surveillance programs, has ruled out returning to the us due to the belief that he would not receive a fair trial. he has been living in moscow under the protection of the russian federal security service (fsb) since last summer. the interview was kept secret and snowden's lawyer has also expressed concerns for his safety. the us president, barack obama, has spoken about the need to protect civil liberties while also pledging to end spying on friendly heads of state. additionally, an unnamed army source suggested snowden could be "poked" on his way back from a supermarket and administered with poison.
660	a report by the commons defence select committee has raised major concerns over the shortfall of specialist troops in britain's armed forces, leaving them vulnerable. key trades including bomb disposal experts, interrogators, and electronic warfare operators are experiencing vacancies. the army is reported to have a shortage of 700 intelligence officers and more than 40% of posts in some medical specialisms are unfilled. under-staffed "operational pinch points" have increased in the royal navy and army, leading to a shortage of around 1,600 troops. the ministry of defence (mod) has reduced the size of the armed forces by 30,000 since 2010 to save £4.7 billion and eliminate a £38 billion equipment overspend. military officers and mps have recommended the uk government offer financial incentives to retain experienced personnel in crucial roles. shortages are occurring at a time when the rate of personnel volunteering to leave the forces is above average. the mod is hoping to fill vacancies by increasing the size of the territorial army but commanders warn that capability gaps could remain. shadow defence secretary vernon coaker expressed concern over the shortfall of trained personnel for critical operational requirements, including specialized roles in engineering, technical and medical expertise. the mod has already implemented financial incentives, specialist pay, and recruitment bonuses to manage pinch-points. those made redundant can also apply to transfer into specialist trades. the ministry maintains confidence in its ability to meet all strategic defense priorities with the right personnel and skill sets.
661	a 90-year-old world war ii veteran, andy nowicki, and his wife, who have lived in a subsidized housing complex in newington, connecticut for 20 years, have been given a eviction notice due to his smoking habit, despite efforts to comply with the complex's new no-smoking policy. the veteran, who started smoking during the war and suffers from mobility issues, is urging the housing authority for an exception due to his age, disability, and war record. the housing authority, however, is unwilling to make an exception, citing health and safety concerns, and the matter is set for a hearing on september 3. the mayor and a state senator have intervened to find a compromise, but no agreement has been reached yet.
662	the gaza-israel border is the scene of a two-week-old conflict between israel and hamas militants, with international journalists facing significant restrictions in accessing the palestinian territory. dozens of international journalists have been prevented from entering gaza due to israeli media restrictions, forcing them to report from a hill near the border. egyptian borders are also closed to journalists. israeli authorities have accused hamas of exploiting civilian casualties for international sympathy, and allowing journalists in would provide a more thorough picture of the military operation. in contrast, during israel's 2006 war against hezbollah militants in lebanon, reporters were allowed to broadcast from israeli artillery positions. however, israel has changed tactics this time and prevented international reporters from being embedded with the military to avoid interference in military operations. the israeli government has faced criticism from press freedom groups and the un for the media restrictions. both israeli and hamas have launched videos on youtube, with the israeli military sharing documentation of its actions and hamas releasing graphic footage and attacks on rival fatah. journalists based inside gaza have controlled the images broadcast, and very few images of hamas fighters or rockets being fired into israel have been seen by the outside world. the line between winning and losing in war can be influenced by public relations, making it essential for journalists to find a balance in the story. however, their ability to do so is hampered when they cannot cover all the angles.
663	a hijacking attempt was thwarted on a plane in xinjiang, china, ten minutes after takeoff between hotan and urumqi. six suspected uyghur hijackers tried to take control of the plane through violence, but were subdued by passengers and crew members, resulting in minor injuries for all parties involved. the suspects were taken into custody and the plane returned to hotan. operations at the airport have since returned to normal, and authorities praised the bravery of the passengers and crew members. the incident is still under investigation, and uyghurs, who are a distinct turkic muslim group, have been labeled terrorists by chinese authorities following outbreaks of violence in recent years.
664	thirteen juveniles escaped from the woodland hills youth development center in nashville, tennessee, for the third time in less than two months. twelve of the escapees were recaptured, but one 16-year-old with a criminal record remains at large. the escapees include several who were involved in the previous incidents. woodland hills, which houses delinquent male youth between 13 and 19 with at least three felonies, has upgraded security measures since the last incident, installing steel panels and reinforcing the perimeter fence with concrete. however, guards lack weapons or pepper spray, and, due to a court settlement, youth are not allowed to be locked inside their rooms. friday's escape occurred after two inmates overpowered a guard, took his radio and keys, and made their way to the perimeter gate, which they opened by breaking in through the guard house. two staff members were injured during the escape.
665	rose west, a serial killer serving life in hmp low newton prison in durham, is reportedly "fuming" after being banned from using the showers following gym sessions due to a string of thefts. prison bosses enforced the rule earlier this year after items were stolen from the gym facilities. female inmates, including west, have complained about feeling "filthy" after workouts and signed a letter demanding the shower ban be overturned. the prison spokesperson confirmed that prisoners are taken back to their cells after using the gym and there is ample time to wash, but inmates argue that using sinks instead is unsatisfactory. west, who earns £16 a week as a tea lady, is reportedly an "avid" gym user and supports the campaign to restore the shower facilities. there is no specific prison service instruction requiring jails to provide showers in jail gyms, according to a source. rose west was convicted of 10 murders in 1995, including the murder of her eight-year-old daughter, heather, whose body was found under the patio at their former home dubbed the "house of horrors." many of the crimes occurred between 1973 and 1979. the house was demolished following west's conviction, and her husband, fred, committed suicide while on remand accused of 12 murders. west was given a life sentence in 1995, the first woman in the uk to be condemned to spend the rest of her life in prison. however, the european court of human rights declared whole life tariffs illegal in july. it is unclear when west will receive a new minimum term from the high court.
666	the sinai peninsula in egypt, home to bedouin tribes and criminal elements, is becoming increasingly lawless, leading to concerns about drug and arms smuggling, human trafficking, and terrorism. this instability threatens egypt's peace treaty with israel and regional security. human rights abuses, including hostage-taking and torture, against african migrants are rampant in the area. recent attacks on israeli and egyptian forces and civilians have heightened tensions, with egypt calling for an end to the peace treaty. israel has boosted security measures, but a deadly rocket attack could jeopardize the treaty and ignite a regional war. the international community, including the us, should engage egypt and israel in discussions on security and preserving the multinational force and observers' mission. egypt's new government must address corruption, respect international commitments to combat human trafficking, and bolster the peninsula's long-term economic prospects. the obama administration's atrocities prevention board could also focus on highlighting the sinai's human rights abuses. ultimately, all countries in the region have a common interest in preserving peace.
667	hundreds of black lives matter protesters gathered at the mall of america in bloomington, minnesota, on saturday despite the mall's policy against political protests. the demonstrators were met by police who made at least 20 arrests, according to cnn affiliate kare. the mall's management stated that organizers ignored their policy and repeated reminders. the mall is the nation's largest, with over 500 businesses, and over a dozen attractions including an indoor roller coaster and an aquarium. protesters simulated the deaths of black men killed by police and held up "hands up, don't shoot" signs. the mall responded with a video message demanding that the protest dispersed and threatened arrests. stores on one side of the mall were closed. some protesters voluntarily left, while others were arrested, and city prosecutors plan to pursue charges.
668	minister francis maude's plan to remove two-and-a-half privilege days for civil servants faced resistance due to the discovery that one of those days was granted by the queen during her coronation 60 years ago. the cabinet office decided to keep the queen's birthday privilege day instead of making changes, and senior civil servants agreed to forgo one-and-a-half days. tory mp bernard jenkin criticized the privilege days as being unacceptable in the current economic climate, with some viewing it as "cooking the books" to disguise the fact that staff were keeping their extra holidays. the palace declined to discuss any talks about the proposal.
669	the much-criticized budget deal is expected to receive final congressional approval this week, ending the stalemate in washington. house speaker john boehner openly expressed his frustrations with the far-right tea party members, calling them "ridiculous" and "lost all credibility." in response, the republican national committee (rnc) is planning to limit the number of debates and strip delegates from candidates who participate in unofficial gop debates and forums. the tea party's influence on the republican party has been a source of internal conflict, and 60% of americans want a third party. it remains to be seen if the tea party will be reined in or if it will break away and form its own party. the political landscape is changing, with unpopular figures like chris christie and the loss of conservatives in the 2012 election fueling speculation that the group may make a significant decision in the near future.
670	the us nuclear regulatory commission (nrc) is facing challenges in implementing measures to prevent nuclear disasters similar to fukushima, which occurred in japan a year ago. the nrc's proposals have good intentions but their effectiveness will depend on execution and timeliness. the industry is taking steps to address vulnerabilities through the "diverse and flexible coping capability" (flex) program, but it might not adequately protect the public. fukushima revealed that us reactors share similarities with the japanese ones in regards to safety concerns, such as hardened vents that don't work without electric power and lack of instruments to monitor spent fuel pools. the nrc has delayed addressing the most crucial recommendation, which involves clarifying regulations for events beyond design basis. this delay complicates the implementation of other recommendations, such as improving emergency equipment protection and dealing with station blackouts. the industry has already installed over 300 pieces of flex equipment, which could make it hard for the nrc to impose future standards. the union of concerned scientists has suggested strengthening reactor safeguards, but the nrc has dismissed some of their recommendations, including expanding emergency evacuation zones, enhancing potassium iodide distribution, and accelerating spent fuel transfer to dry casks. the nrc's stance may undermine efforts to enhance us reactor safety, particularly during a time when millions of americans live near nuclear power plants.
671	harriet harman, the deputy leader of the labour party, was criticized for requesting that prime minister david cameron inform her each time raf jets took off for bombing operations against islamist militants in iraq during an emergency shadow cabinet meeting before the commons vote. her colleagues and experts regarded her request as "farcical" and "daft," as political authority and military actions are generally handled by the military without frequent political input. harman's concern was for avoiding unintended civilian casualties. meanwhile, a labour peer, lord wood, recommended a "sunset clause" for the military action in iraq to limit its duration, but was reportedly overruled by the party leadership.

673	in the moscow mayoral elections on september 8, 2013, anti-corruption campaigner alexei navalny unexpectedly received around one-third of the votes in exit polls, significantly higher than anticipated. incumbent mayor and putin ally sergei sobyanin edged closer to victory but failed to reach the 50% threshold for outright victory in the first round. navalny's team claimed that he had, in fact, garnered over 35% of the votes and demanded a run-off election. despite falling short of victory, navalny's strong showing provided significant hope for the opposition, especially given his history of leading protests against election manipulation and corruption within the ruling elite. navalny's performance was described as 'staggering' even by state-funded media. the official count was set to continue the following day.
674	a judge in los angeles warned actress lindsay lohan on wednesday that the only way to avoid jail time on a felony grand theft charge is to be acquitted in a trial. lohan's lawyer previously stated that she would consider a plea deal, but only if it did not involve jail time. the prosecution offered a plea deal during the hearing, but its terms were not disclosed. judge keith schwartz told lohan that if she is convicted, her ability to influence the sentence could be lessened. lohan has appeared in court eight times in the past nine months due to legal issues and rehab stints, and this hearing caused a media frenzy due to her attire. she wore conservative clothes but high-heeled shoes. the prosecution provided lohan and her lawyer with all police reports and video evidence from the jewelry store where the alleged theft occurred. if a plea deal is not reached before march 10, the case will go to another judge for a preliminary hearing and possible trial. the penalty for a felony grand theft conviction is between 16 months and three years in prison, while a misdemeanor conviction would have a potential sentence of one year. the value of the stolen necklace and lohan's criminal record would determine the exact sentencing. lohan is currently on probation for a 2007 drunk driving conviction and was sent to rehab a month ago. her probation officer had threatened to send her to jail for 180 days if she violated the rules before her next court appearance, which has since been canceled, and judge schwartz is now taking over her legal cases.

710	cuban-americans, many of whom have strong familial ties to cuba but are removed from the memories of fidel castro's revolution, are questioning the continued us embargo on the country. younger cuban-americans, including those who have lost family members to the regime, are advocating for an end to the embargo and shifting their political allegiances to the democratic party. this generational shift could potentially lead to democrats making inroads with cuban-americans, who have long been a republican demographic. hillary clinton, the clear front-runner for the democratic presidential nomination in 2016, has expressed her support for normalizing relations with cuba. the upcoming florida gubernatorial race will serve as a measure of the gop's grasp on cuban-american voters, as incumbent republican governor rick scott, who supports the embargo, faces a challenge from former republican-turned-democratic governor charlie crist, who has openly called for an end to the embargo. additionally, a growing number of younger latinos, both of cuban and non-cuban descent, are advocating for an end to the embargo. the new york times and a june poll from florida international university have also expressed support for lifting the embargo, and the obama administration has eased some travel restrictions to cuba. however, lifting the embargo requires action from congress, and all seven cuban-american legislators are against doing so. the changing cuban-american community, including a larger number of post-1990 immigrants and attrition among the historicos, may eventually exert enough political pressure to thaw the frozen relationship between the us and cuba.

712	a virgin atlantic pilot, mark entwistle, was jailed for 14 years for orchestrating a £30million mortgage fraud scheme. entwistle, along with three accomplices, tricked top lenders into issuing mortgages on other people's houses. instead of using the money for legitimate purposes, entwistle funded his high-rolling lifestyle in las vegas casinos, paid off debts, and purchased a luxury boat. the fraud led to innocent families being evicted from their homes in the home counties. entwistle recruited jonathan gilbert to act as his solicitor, and mortgage brokers nicholas pomroy and matthew robinson to process the fraudulent applications. the four men were jailed for a total of 34 years. entwistle's actions caused significant stress and hardship for some victims, who lost their homes, investments, and jobs. the judge described entwistle as arrogant and greedy, and noted that the fraud was professional and well-orchestrated over a long period.
713	two scientists, rod thomas and roger holmes, have spent nine years in a garden shed resurrecting 'flossie,' a 1962 ict 1301 mainframe computer, believed to be one of the oldest surviving in the world. flossie cost £250,000 in 1962 (equivalent to £4.2 million today) and had 16,000 transistors and 4,000 logic boards. its computing power is equivalent to a digital watch, and the data it holds can fit on less than a third of a cd. flossie was used to produce gce exam results and certificates at london university in the 1960s, and it appeared as a prop in films and tv shows like james bond, dr. who, and blake's 7. its original purpose was to produce exam results in the uk, and 1/3 of a cd holds all the data it currently contains. thomas and holmes plan to recover its software, which will shed light on the birth of the british computer industry, but they face the challenge of finding a new home for it as the farm where it is currently housed is being sold. the 1962 1301 mainframe computer is the only surviving example of second-generation british mainframe still in working order.

748	pope francis' efforts to facilitate talks between presidents barack obama and raul castro of cuba have been met with controversy among some roman catholics, particularly in south florida, where many older catholics view the castro brothers negatively. although many catholics worldwide see francis' role in promoting progress in communist cuba as a positive development, some cuban-americans feel betrayed by their spiritual leader. efrain rivas, a former political prisoner in cuba, expressed his disappointment and indicated that he feels disconnected from the church. miami archbishop thomas wenski acknowledged the concerns of some catholics but emphasized that many exiles welcome the diplomatic breakthrough. cardinal jaime ortiga, a cuban cardinal close to francis, has played a key role in improving ties between the church and the officially atheist state. some older catholics wish the church had taken a harder line, while others see the church's unique position inside cuba as a reason to trust the promises of change made by both obama and castro. while the catholic church remains the dominant religious force in cuba, attendance at mass is low due to decades of official atheism, and its mediation role could be crucial in facilitating trust in the promises of change. historian jesus mendez, a cuban exile who teaches at barry university, believes that most catholics will welcome the pope's intervention as an attempt to increase religious freedom on the island.
749	australian house prices in major capital cities, particularly sydney, have experienced significant growth in the past year, with the average sydney house price reaching $690,000, a 15.4% increase from the previous year. house prices in sydney are more than double those in lower-priced cities like hobart. the increases have been attributed to record-low interest rates, lack of availability, and high demand. some economists predict a drop-off in house price growth in the next financial year due to an expected increase in housing supply and potential affordability concerns. however, others believe the market will continue to see moderate gains. mortgage approvals have also seen a recent decline due to new tougher regulations.

751	the town of pahoa in hawaii, known for its lush fields of papaya and anthurium plants, has been devastated by a slow-moving lava flow from kilauea mountain. the eruption began in june and has taken four months to reach the town. residents have been forced to evacuate and several homes have been destroyed. the before-and-after images show the vast swathes of green fields being replaced by molten rock, changing hawaii's landscape. the area was once famous for its vibrant rainforests and nurseries but is now a barren wasteland of grey, hollow structures. the lava tree state park, a key landmark, is an ominous depiction of the destruction caused by molten rock. authorities have warned residents to be prepared for evacuation and have closed the main road through the town due to the threat of the lava cutting off the key access point to the district. the main flow has not advanced for over a month, but officials warn of active breakouts. despite warnings and emergency services, there is little preventative action the government can take in the face of lava.
752	iain duncan smith's officials have criticized a campaign by the charity church action on poverty, which blame the politician's benefit changes for the increasing use of food banks. the charity's billboard advert uses an image similar to the conservative party's famous 1979 election poster, 'labour isn't working,' but instead depicts long lines of people in front of a food bank. the department for work and pensions (dwp) has denied that there is evidence to support the charity's claims, stating that benefits changes, delays, or stoppages are the most common reasons for people seeking food aid. church action on poverty insists that their figures come from the trussell trust, which runs 400 food banks in the uk, and has been accused by iain duncan smith of "scaremongering" and "political messaging." the dwp states that 92% of benefits are processed on time compared to 86% in 2009-10, and claims that its welfare reforms will improve the lives of the poorest families. the charity, which is supported by the church of england and other churches, believes that the rise in food poverty and food bank usage is a national disgrace and a violation of the basic human right to food. the church of england has stated that church action on poverty is an independent organization but does share some personnel. sir tony baldry, a tory mp, recently conducted a survey that found 62% of food bank users did so due to low income, 42% as a result of benefit changes, and 35% due to benefit delays. mark pritchard, a tory mp, has called on the church to focus more on gospel teachings instead of politics. iain duncan smith has refused to meet with chris mould, the chairman of church action on poverty, to discuss the issue.

755	john lewis, a british retailer, is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year. the exhibition at the flagship store on oxford street showcases the company's rich history, featuring anecdotes of notable events and figures that contributed to its growth from a single draper's shop into a high street institution. founded by john lewis in 1864, the company began with humble beginnings as a draper's shop selling silks, laces, and other textiles. following lewis' rejection of a partnership offer from peter robinson, he opened his own store and adopted a low-overhead strategy with cheap inventory and minimal advertising. throughout its history, john lewis has been an integral part of british culture, particularly for the middle classes. notable experiences include the acquisition of waitrose in 1937, which began as a chain of grocery shops, and the connection to various significant historical figures and events. for example, the company sold a silver cross pram, similar to one used to transport the author, in the 1950s. additionally, john lewis had early interactions with notable individuals like amy johnson, a record-breaking aviator recruited as a sales assistant in 1928, and dr crippen, whose trial involved textiles from the store. john lewis' expansion efforts were influenced by innovative retailers like harry gordon selfridge, who had revolutionary hiring practices, and his son spedan lewis, who introduced enlightened management ideas, such as cutting hours and employee profit-sharing, which transformed the company into the successful partnership it is today. spedan's hiring of top chess players, including the code-breaker hugh alexander, demonstrates his commitment to selecting the best talent. despite setbacks, such as the destruction of the flagship store by german bombs during world war ii, the company continued to expand and acquired stores like george henry lee, jones brothers, and caleys. the john lewis partnership thrived during the great depression due to
756	the house intelligence committee's two-year investigation into the september 11, 2012 attack on the us compound in benghazi, libya, debunked allegations that the obama administration mishandled their response. the report cleared the cia and the military of serious charges, including providing inadequate security and denying available air support. while the diplomatic compound had inadequate security and needed cia assistance, there was no intelligence failure prior to the attack. susan rice's initial assertion that the attack was sparked by a protest over a film was based on intelligence assessed at the time. the report also rejected claims of a cover-up regarding the benghazi base being used to smuggle weapons to syrian rebels. the committee found that the cia agents were tracking local groups smuggling weapons, not collecting them. all government agencies ultimately cooperated with the inquiry, and no cia personnel were intimidated by the administration.
757	parents may worry about their children spending too much time on laptops and smartphones, but data shows that graduates with degrees in computer science from universities like oxford earn the highest salaries, with an average of £43,895 six months after graduation. famous tech entrepreneurs like larry page and mark zuckerberg are also computer science graduates. professor michael wooldridge, head of the computer science department at oxford, believes this success is due to the discipline's focus on mathematical clarity. graduates in arts subjects, such as drama, dance, and cinematics from essex, are the lowest earners. computer science courses are increasingly commanding high salaries, and the data reveals that science and engineering degrees generally lead to higher earnings. graduates' earnings vary significantly depending on the university they attend, with a growing gap between the highest and lowest earners. one in ten graduates had not obtained a job six months after leaving university. oxford, imperial college london, and cambridge are among the top universities for computer science graduates' earnings.

773	a new study reveals that cancer is as old as multi-cellular life on earth and may never be completely eradicated, as it has been discovered in ancient hydra species. scientists in germany and croatia made this finding while searching for the origin of the cancer gene and believe these animals' suffering from tumors will help in the fight against the disease. the invasive nature of cancer cells also predates millions of years. in contrast, the number of deaths from heart disease and stroke is declining in most european countries, and cancer is projected to become the leading cause of death. despite over $500 billion invested in cancer research globally, every second person with the disease still succumbs to it, making it unlikely that the "war on cancer" declared in the 1970s can be won. yet, knowing the disease's origins and behavior provides the best chance to develop effective treatment and prevention strategies. the study was published in nature communications.

776	sir hugh orde, a former chief of police in northern ireland, expressed concern over the conspiracy to hide suspected murderer dale cregan in manchester during his five-week run from authorities. orde drew comparisons with his experience in northern ireland, where communities had protected terrorists and criminals due to a culture of fear that prevented people from reporting information. cregan, wanted for two murders, allegedly had help from the community to avoid detection and may have been hiding in an outhouse at the white hart pub in hyde. police offered a £50,000 reward and conducted numerous armed raids, but cregan was not found until he shot and killed two policewomen in a tragic turn of events. orde believes the community's response to the incident showed that most residents support the police. similar cases of unsolved murders and large rewards in northern ireland have shown that the community's fear and lack of trust in the authorities can hinder investigations. examples of these cases include the murder of joanne mathers in 1986, for which a £20,000 reward was offered but the murderer was never found, and the murder of police constable ronan kerr by dissident republicans in 2011, whose killers have also eluded capture despite a £50,000 reward.

778	a new magazine titled "illegal!" has been launched in london, sold by drug addicts on the streets. the founders argue that everyone has the right to do what they want with their bodies, even if it means engaging in illegal drug use. the sellers pay £1.50 per copy and sell it for £3.50, pocketing the difference to fund their drug habit. the danish founder of the magazine, michael lodberg olsen, aims to provide drug addicts with an alternative to theft and prostitution to generate revenue. the magazine has sold around 15,000 copies in copenhagen and 2,000 copies in london. however, police are criticizing the initiative, arguing that it legitimizes and formalizes fundraising for illegal drug use. the legality of the magazine's sale is questionable, and scotland yard has not yet responded to inquiries about whether selling the magazine constitutes illegal activity. some residents and critics argue that the magazine will only increase drug dependency and contribute to crime.
779	manchester united's goalkeeper david de gea has been the club's most important player since sir alex ferguson retired, and his contract is set to expire at the end of next season. spanish international victor valdes, a three-time champions league winner, has recently joined united as a backup goalkeeper and will challenge de gea for the starting position. valdes has a strong relationship with manager louis van gaal and goalkeeping coach frans hoek, who gave him his debut at barcelona 12 years ago. both de gea and his family are content in manchester and have adjusted to the english lifestyle, but madrid is interested in signing him as a replacement for iker casillas. united's chief executive ed woodward has already spoken with de gea's agent jorge mendes about a new contract, and formal talks are planned. valdes has signed an 18-month contract, and united may be preparing themselves in case de gea's contract negotiations don't go well. valdes will not be in manchester for a watching brief; he will challenge de gea, and van gaal wants it that way. valdes has been looking for accommodation in wilmslow and has joined the enclave of spanish players at the club, including juan mata, ander herrera, and bojan krkic. united may need to offer de gea a record-breaking contract to keep him at the club.
780	house speaker john boehner used an unconventional messenger, taylor swift, to criticize president barack obama's free community college proposal by creating a blog post with swift gifs and arguments opposing the proposal. boehner's office argued that the proposal would result in a large expense, and suggested working together to lower education costs instead. swift was chosen as an effective way to reach younger voters, who are a key demographic in the 2016 elections. other republicans have also used swift to communicate with young voters, including senator joni ernst and senator ted cruz's digital strategist. swift has not strayed far from her squeaky-clean image, making her a safe pick for the gop. the success of the gop's use of swift in reaching young voters remains to be seen.
781	the high speed railway (hs2) preparation bill, which enables the government to buy land for the proposed hs2 railway linking london to the north of england, was approved in a vote in the commons yesterday with a majority of 316. the bill, which passed with 350 votes to 34 against, will now progress to the house of lords for further scrutiny. hs2 was described as an "essential railway" by prime minister david cameron, who urged against building an "old-style rail line" and highlighted the capacity issues on the current west coast mainline. the bill allows for the acquisition of property and compensation for evicted families along the route, which will cost an estimated £50 billion. despite opposition from some conservative mps and threats from labour to withdraw their support, the party ultimately backed the bill, with shadow transport secretary mary creagh acknowledging the need to address capacity problems. scotland was also announced as a potential beneficiary of the high-speed railway, with a study planned to increase its benefits. rebels opposed to the project, including prominent conservative backbenchers nadine dorries and david davis, argue that the funds could be better spent elsewhere.

802	president obama is expected to announce changes to the nsa's controversial surveillance programs that collect data on american phone calls on friday. the programs, which have been a subject of controversy since former nsa contractor edward snowden's leaks in june, have been defended by the administration as crucial for preventing terrorist attacks. however, a recent study by the new america foundation found that traditional investigative methods, rather than bulk surveillance, played the largest role in preventing terrorism-related cases in the us since 9/11. specifically, the analysis of 225 individuals charged with terrorism-related offenses found that the nsa's bulk collection of american telephone metadata under section 215 of the patriot act had a minimal impact, contributing to at most 1.8% of these cases. section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act played a role in 4.4%, and other unidentified authorities played a role in 1.3%. the remainder of the cases' initiation methods were not identified in the study. furthermore, the case of basaaly moalin, a san diego cabdriver who provided funds to al-shabaab, challenges the necessity of the bulk collection program as the government's justification for its expedited investigative capabilities was undercut in this case. the fbi waited two months to begin an investigation and wiretap moalin's phone after using the nsa's database to link a number in somalia to him. the obama administration is facing a choice on how to proceed with the phone data collection program. options include continuing it as is, giving it to a private third party, or mandating that phone companies keep the data. the legal status of the program is uncertain, with some federal judges ruling it unconstitutional and others in favor. the new america foundation recommends abandoning the bulk phone data collection program entirely and returning to the traditional approach of having the government get a court order to access a suspect's phone records.

972	andrea sneiderman, the widow of a businessman shot and killed outside a suburban preschool in atlanta, georgia, was charged with malice murder, conspiracy, racketeering, perjury, and insurance fraud on august 2, 2012. sneiderman is accused of conspiring with her former boss and lover, hemy neuman, who was convicted of the slaying four months prior. the indictment claims that sneiderman provided neuman with her husband's schedule to enable him to carry out the murder, and that the two intended to enjoy a life together, eliminate neuman's debt problems, and benefit from the sneidermans' assets and insurance policies. sneiderman's attorneys have promised a vigorous defense. neuman, who claimed during his trial that he was motivated by dreams featuring angels and demons, including olivia newton-john and barry white, was arrested in march 2012. sneiderman was taken into custody on august 2 and was being held without bond. the sneiderman family expressed relief at the arrest but called it an important step in pursuit of justice for russell sneiderman.
973	a new study published in the journal plos one has found that men who consume large amounts of ground beef and other red meat, especially if it's grilled or well-done, have a higher risk of developing aggressive forms of prostate cancer. the increased risk can be mainly attributed to the method of cooking and the degree of doneness. men who ate the most ground beef were over twice as likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer as those who did not consume any. heterocyclic amines (hcas) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs), which form when meat is cooked at high temperatures, are believed to be the carcinogens responsible for this association. the study takes the investigation of the link between meat consumption and prostate cancer a step further by focusing on the cooking methods and degrees of doneness. additionally, consuming fatty lunchmeats and liver was also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. poultry, bacon, and low-fat hot dogs and sausages appeared to have little influence on cancer risk. the study's findings support the notion that minimally processed meat may be harmful, and men are encouraged to moderate their intake of highly cooked red meat. however, the study has limitations, and the data on meat consumption relied on the participants' memory, so the findings should be considered with caution.
974	spring city councilman neil sorensen proposed an ordinance encouraging every household in the small utah town of spring city to have a firearm and for teachers to receive gun training. the full city council agreed to debate the bill next month. sorensen believes arming teachers could have prevented some deaths in mass shootings, such as sandy hook, and makes the point that with only a part-time police force, response time can be slow. the measure, which would make guns mandatory in every household and offer concealed firearms training to teachers, has the support of some council members and residents, even though school administrators are against it. opponents argue that more guns in schools would increase danger, while some residents believe it would make the town safer. the idea was inspired by kennesaw, georgia, which passed a similar law in 1982, claiming a decrease in burglaries. however, there is debate over whether having more armed teachers would effectively prevent or mitigate damage in mass shootings. utah law already allows teachers to carry concealed weapons in classrooms, but the district does not encourage it due to potential concerns.
975	public toilet closures in the uk have been a significant issue, with over four in ten public toilets having closed in the past decade. this trend has been widespread across various councils, including glasgow, where only eight remain open. health experts have expressed concern that the inability to use the restroom when needed could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, particularly for the elderly and vulnerable populations. councils have made significant budget cuts to public toilet provision, leading to closures in various areas, including lancaster, the lake district, and newcastle. the british toilet association (bta) has been asked to compile an updated toilet map of the uk by disability organizations, and efforts are being made to increase the number of community toilets as a potential solution. age uk's charity director general, michelle mitchell, emphasized the importance of public toilets for older people, stating that the concern extends beyond just financial implications and can have a devastating impact on their quality of life.

977	an nhs trust, oxleas nhs foundation trust, has admitted responsibility for the death of a young mother, diana mager, who took her own life in a hospital room while suffering from post-natal depression. initial responses from the trust stated that her death could not have been predicted or prevented despite her previous suicide attempts. however, following a legal challenge from her widower, adam mager, the trust admitted that they could have prevented her suicide. diana mager, 33, had been under treatment for severe post-natal depression since november 2011 and had made several suicidal attempts. she was even caught trying to jump from the roof of the tate modern and had smuggled a knife into her room. however, at the time of her death in august 2012, she was being checked by nurses only every 15 minutes despite her medical records stating that she was at very high risk of killing herself. mr. mager's lawyer expressed concern about the trust's initial denial and called for greater transparency and honesty in mental health care in the uk. the trust has since launched an internal investigation, offering condolences to the family and promising to review their internal inquiry for further learning. for confidential support, contact the samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or visit their website at www.samaritans.org.

979	a dispute has arisen in stratford-upon-avon after the shakespeare birthplace trust converted a historic barn on the property where anne hathaway, shakespeare's wife, spent her childhood into a snack kiosk without obtaining necessary planning permission. the grade i listed thatched barn, which was inside the curtilage of the 12-bedroom cottage built in the early 1460s, was used as a pea shed in the early 1900s before being turned into a cafe in april. however, it was only recently discovered that the shed was considered part of the cottage's site, and therefore subject to the same planning restrictions as grade i listed buildings. the trust has been ordered to apply for retrospective planning permission, which, if refused, may result in the building being transformed back to its original condition. the barn is believed to be the place where shakespeare courted his future wife. the trust had believed they did not need planning permission for the renovations, but new information revealed that the shed was a grade i listed building. the barn is considered part of the historic farmhouse site and was not a tudor building, but was likely erected in the first half of the 20th century. the trust has until november 5 to make a final application for planning permission. if the application is denied, they may be required to restore the building to its original state. the anne hathaway cottage, where she lived as a child, is a significant site in shakespeare's history, with the couple getting married there in 1582, when anne was 26 and pregnant, and shakespeare was just 18. their marriage is believed to have been influenced by the pregnancy and may have been an unhappy one, resulting in three children: susanna, hamnet, and judith. hamnet died at the age of 11, and shakespeare is believed to have been inspired by the loss to write the play hamlet. the couple's grave is located inside holy trinity church in stratford-

986	scientists have discovered ancient water, estimated to be up to 2.7 billion years old, trapped deep within the earth's crust in sites around the world. this water, which could amount to around 2.5 million cubic miles (11 cubic million km), is highly salty and rich in minerals due to reactions with the rock. researchers have also found evidence of hydrogen production in these ancient water reservoirs, potentially supporting new forms of life. the water was tasted by professor barbara sherwood lollar, who described it as "terrible" due to its high salt content. these findings expand our understanding of the earth's potentially habitable environments and the origins of the water on our planet.
987	in an exclusive edinburgh suburb, former royal bank of scotland boss fred goodwin has been embroiled in a long-standing dispute with neighbors over a double-layer, 25ft high leylandii hedge. the neighbors, frustrated with the lack of sunlight in their gardens, have taken matters into their own hands and chopped down the nearest layer of hedge. this comes ahead of a new law that empowers councils to make decisions regarding hedge disputes. goodwin purchased the six-bedroom mansion and hedge in 2011 after facing criticism for his role in the bank's massive losses during his tenure, culminating in a multi-billion-pound bailout. despite efforts to reduce the hedge's size, neighbors continue to find it a barrier to light. the high hedges (scotland) act, which grants councils the authority to force hedge owners to cut back hedges that block light, will be enforced starting april 1, 2023. when approached for comment, joyce goodwin (fred's estranged wife, still living in the mansion) responded with 'what hedge?' the high hedges act was proposed in 2012 and passed in 2013.

989	a new study published in the january 2008 issue of archives of general psychiatry found that the prevalence of autism cases in california children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers removed the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in 1999, suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder. the study, which looked at cases of autism in california between 1995 and 2007, found that the autism rate continued to increase from 3 to 4 per 1,000 children, despite a significant decrease in exposure to thimerosal during that period. a child psychiatrist who supported the study said it "very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine." however, advocacy groups argue that it is too soon to determine whether autism rates were affected by removing thimerosal from vaccines, and point out that the study did not include children under the age of 3, who were still being exposed to thimerosal at the time. thimerosal, a neurotoxin, has not been used in childhood vaccines since 2001, except for some flu shots. no definitive cause for autism has been identified, but genetics and environment are believed to be contributors. autism rates have been on the rise, with as many as one in every 166 children in the us diagnosed with the disorder. symptoms include no babbling or pointing by 12 months, no single words by 16 months, no brief phrases by 24 months, and loss of language or social skills. companies began removing thimerosal from vaccines in the late 1990s due to concerns about its health effects and the addition of new vaccines to the routine shot schedule, as well as government pressure.

"americans are starting to wonder, is there anything the mccain campaign isn't lying about?" vietor said in a statement. palin's trip to mexico on a personal vacation and her visit to canada were also confirmed by her camp. during an appearance on "the view," mccain was pressed on palin's qualifications and her record of reform. mccain defended palin, pointing to her efforts to sell alaska's state jet and fire the governor's chef, but was unable to provide specifics on how she would reform washington. palin's reputation for reform was also called into question when it was revealed that she had hired a lobbyist to secure millions in pork for her town and her state. both campaigns exchanged harsh attacks in tv ads and memos on friday, with the mccain campaign releasing an ad accusing the obama campaign of launching "desperate attacks and smears" against palin, and the obama campaign releasing two ads mocking mccain's age and lack of technological skills. obama campaign manager david plouffe issued a memo accusing the mccain campaign of engaging in "smears, lies, and cynical attempts to

1075	a gene linked to the amount of grey matter in the brain and intelligence has been identified by scientists at king's college london. the variant of the gene, nptn, was associated with a thinner cerebral cortex and poorer performance in verbal and non-verbal reasoning tests among nearly 1,600 14-year-olds. previous studies have shown that the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain, plays a critical role in various cognitive functions like memory, attention, language, and consciousness. the researchers studied over 54,000 genetic variants related to brain development and found that the nptn gene, which encodes a protein affecting brain cell communication, had reduced expression in specific parts of the left brain hemisphere in individuals carrying the gene variant. they also observed differences in nptn gene activity in the left and right hemispheres of mice, suggesting that its impaired function in certain regions of the left hemisphere could underlie intellectual differences. the study's findings indicate that the identified genetic variation accounts for only about 0.5% of the total variation in intelligence. the research team hopes that their work may help understand the biological mechanisms behind mental disorders and eventually lead to more effective diagnosis and treatment for conditions such as schizophrenia and autism.
1076	the international monetary fund (imf) has revised down its growth forecasts for the uk economy, predicting a minuscule growth of 0.2% in 2012 and 1.4% in 2013. the imf blames the eurozone crisis for the downgraded forecast, as it expects the eurozone to be in recession this year and the world economy to grow by only 3.5% in 2012, instead of the previous forecast of 3.9%. businesses in the uk are hoping for an impact from the £80bn "funding for lending" scheme, but demand for credit remains low due to europe's crisis. inflation in the uk, which hit a 31-month low in june, is expected to continue to ease. the imf calls on european leaders to follow through on promises made at their summit, including banking and budgetary reforms. the uk government's budget deficit improvement will be slower than expected due to slower growth, and the imf urges advanced non-eurozone economies like britain to respond effectively by pushing ahead with further unconventional measures such as quantitative easing. the eurozone's indecision over ratifying the new €500bn bailout fund adds to the uncertainty, with germany's supreme court yet to rule on its legality, causing weeks of turmoil on financial markets.

1086	christopher columbus, who visited a 5-year-old's class in 2013, is commonly portrayed as having discovered the americas and proven the world was round. however, historians william phillips and leanne howe agree that it's important to tell children the truth about columbus, who didn't actually figure out the earth's shape or discover america first. columbus struggled to get funding for his voyage due to his inaccurate calculations and limited geographical knowledge. moreover, the indigenous peoples of the caribbean had settled societies, contrary to the depiction of primitive populations. columbus did discover new lands and initiated the columbian exchange, leading to significant historical impacts like new trade routes, languages, and cultures. however, it's essential to acknowledge his brutal actions, such as taking slaves and introducing diseases. regardless, columbus' bravery and historical significance make him an important figure despite his mistakes and negative consequences.

1150	a same-sex marriage bill is expected to pass in tasmania's lower house of parliament, making it the first australian state to legalize same-sex marriage. the ruling labor party and the greens are co-sponsoring the bill, which will deliver a potential economic boost of aus$100 million in gay tourism if it passes. this will come despite opposition from some, including prime minister julia gillard and counterpart tony abbott, who argue marriage is between a man and a woman. if the upper house approves, thousands of same-sex couples in tasmania and other australian states and territories may rush to marry, and it could pave the way for broader change. public support for same-sex marriage in tasmania is significant, with some citing a "convict past" contributing to the shift in public thinking towards acceptance. the federal parliament is also preparing to vote on changes to the marriage act to allow same-sex marriage, but the chance of success is minimal as only the ruling labor party is permitting its members a conscience vote. rodney croome, leader of the gay rights lobby, remains optimistic and expects a significant number of same-sex couples to marry if the bill passes.

1158	former us vice-president al gore's 2007 apocalyptic warning that the north polar ice cap could be completely gone in seven years due to climate change was contradicted by recent data revealing an increase in arctic ice extent for the second year in a row. the mail on sunday reported that the ice had expanded by 43% to 5.62 million square kilometres last monday, august 25, which is the highest level recorded since 2006. this increase was substantiated by satellite images from the university of illinois's cryosphere project, which also showed more concentrated and thicker ice. although some scientists have predicted ice-free summers in the near future, experts now believe that natural variability, such as ocean temperatures, may be contributing to the arctic's ice recovery, and that more research is needed to establish the extent of this impact. polar bears, which were thought to be declining in number due to melting ice, have seen their population estimated to be higher than in the 1970s, and computer model predictions of declining bear populations caused by ice melt have also failed to come true.
1159	mauricio pochettino was disappointed with tottenham's 1-1 draw against fiorentina in the europa league as he believed spurs deserved more from their first-leg performance at white hart lane. roberto soldado opened the scoring for tottenham with a volley in the sixth minute, but jose maria basanta equalized for fiorentina in the 36th minute, securing a valuable away goal. pochettino sent on harry kane as a second-half substitute, but opted to rest several key players due to spurs' busy schedule. fiorentina boss vincenzo montella felt his team finished the stronger side and were unlucky not to win. spurs currently sit sixth in the premier league and face six games in 17 days, including the capital one cup final against chelsea. pochettino will have to make tough decisions on team selection to manage the upcoming fixtures, with both the europa league and premier league offering the possibility of champions league qualification.
1160	the australian government has classified the sydney siege, which occurred at the lindt chocolate cafe in december 2014, as a terrorist incident for insurance purposes. this ruling, made by treasurer joe hockey, means that insurers cannot refuse claims due to terrorism exclusion clauses in their policies. three insurance claims have been registered related to the siege. gunman man haron monis held 18 hostages and killed manager tori johnson and barrister katrina dawson. he displayed the islamic flag during the siege. some hostages are reportedly seeking large sums of money for media interviews. the government is conducting a review to learn lessons from the siege, and an inquest is scheduled to begin in january.

1163	joaquin "el chapo" guzman, the world's most powerful drug baron with an estimated fortune of over $1 billion, has eluded capture since escaping from a mexican prison in a laundry truck in 2001. recently, there were reports that guzman was killed in a shootout between two drug gangs in the guatemalan jungle, but guatemalan officials now call it a misunderstanding, as no evidence of his presence was found at the scene. guzman, who is accused of starting mexico's cartel wars and presiding over a $1 billion drug empire, has infiltrated the highest level of mexico's government and is a top drug lord wanted by both the us and mexico. the confusion arose from mistaken eyewitness accounts and guatemalan interior minister mauricio lopez bonilla apologized for the earlier reports. guzman, 5ft 2in tall, has evaded capture for over a decade and is the subject of a vast manhunt, known for his vast drugs operation that moves tons of drugs at a time from colombia into mexico and on to the us, and his involvement in the killings of his rivals. recently, he was officially recognized as chicago's public enemy number one by the city's crime commission, following a long history of crimes and violence, including the massacre of 27 ranch workers in 2011. guzman's cartel has been expanding internationally, and he is known to have a bounty of $7 million on his head.

1165	one year ago, a tunisian street vendor's self-immolation sparked a wave of protests that led to the downfall of oppressive governments in the arab world. digital activism through social media platforms like twitter, facebook, and youtube played a significant role in organizing these protests. however, a new threat to digital activism is emerging in the us with the house of representatives expected to vote on the stop online piracy act (sopa) and protect ip act. these bills would require social media platforms to proactively monitor and censor users to prevent copyright infringement, while website operators who fail to comply could be blacklisted and prosecuted. critics argue that these bills' legal and technical solutions resemble those used by authoritarian regimes to censor online dissent. sopa and protect ip could enable abuse of copyright law to stifle criticism, making online speech more vulnerable to censorship. existing copyright law has already been used to suppress critics, as seen in the case of security researcher trevor eckhart, who faced legal threats for analyzing a software program. the russian and chinese governments have used copyright claims to crack down on activists. the deeper issue is that some members of congress seek to regulate the global internet for the benefit of the us entertainment industry, while also expressing support for global internet freedom. rep. christopher smith has introduced a new version of the global online freedom act to punish companies that sell censorship and surveillance equipment to authoritarian regimes. the impact of sopa and protect ip on digital activism could be severe, making the world even more dangerous for bloggers and activists.
1166	isis militants in syria are reportedly undergoing training to fly three seized fighter jets at the al-jarrah military airport near aleppo. the jets, believed to be decades-old mig21 or mig23 models taken from the syrian military, have been used for short flight training, raising concerns about potential attacks on british, us, and french targets in iraq. isis has been building a full-equipped military, seizing large tanks, artillery, and heavy weapons, including several major airfields. it is unclear whether the jets are equipped with weaponry or if the pilots are able to fly long distances. isis has previously captured jets in other parts of syria, but they were not in flying condition. kurdish forces, backed by us-led air strikes, have been making gains in the fight against militants in the key northern syrian town of kobani, pushing them back from their positions. meanwhile, six senior figures in the pakistani taliban have pledged allegiance to isis and its leader abu bakr al-baghdadi, expanding the group's influence among islamist groups. this could have serious consequences for security in pakistan, particularly near the afghan border. isis has been making gains around ramadi in iraq and has imposed a curfew in the city's provincial capital over fears of an advance. capturing ramadi would give isis unbroken control of a massive stretch of the syrian-turkish border. isis leader al-baghdadi was described by the new un human rights commissioner, zeid ra'ad al hussein, as the antithesis of human rights and a potentially genocidal movement.
1167	an nhs dentist, dr. anand kamath, who took on a large number of patients to prevent them from paying privately, was driven to suicide after health chiefs threatened to strike him off due to record-keeping issues. despite his dedication to the nhs and a 10,000-strong patient list, the primary care trust launched an investigation when officials criticized his record-keeping. dr. kamath and his wife, dr. rajni prasad, had been working relentlessly for the nhs for ten years without holidays or lunchbreaks. the couple tried to take on as many patients as possible and were on a modest contract. after two minor complaints, an audit led to a meeting where they were threatened with severe disciplinary actions, and a letter warned them of potential suspension from the nhs-approved dental list. dr. kamath's wife, who was also a dentist, found him dead at their home shortly after the letter arrived. she described the health officials' behavior as bullying and the pressure as unreasonable. the british dental association called for an inquiry into his death, and his wife expressed frustration that they received no support during the process. the nhs england spokesman confirmed that the investigation followed national clinical assessment service advice. the inquest recorded a verdict of suicide, with the coroner noting that the unreasonable pressure from the trust was a significant contributing factor.
1168	high blood pressure, also known as the "silent killer," affects more than 12.6 million people in england, with over five million of them unaware they have the condition. it is a major cause of premature death and disability, leading to strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, and kidney failure. the latest data from public health england (phe) shows that the annual cost from diseases caused by high blood pressure is estimated at £2.1 billion. phe has set up a blood pressure system leadership board to encourage people to take simple steps to reduce their blood pressure, including changing their diet, keeping a healthy weight, and not drinking too much alcohol. regular blood pressure checks and alerting doctors of any changes are also essential. companies are being urged to offer high-quality testing for their staff, and the focus will be on the most deprived areas, where people are 30% more likely to have hypertension. getting the nation's blood pressure levels into the normal range could prevent over half of all strokes and many heart attacks.

1171	alabama's chief justice roy moore has ordered probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, opposing a federal court ruling that declared the state's ban on gay marriage unconstitutional. moore, known for his conservative views, claimed that probate judges should not issue licenses inconsistent with the alabama constitution. several couples had been camped outside courthouses, hoping to be the first to receive licenses. the american civil liberties union (aclu) set up a phone line for couples denied licenses and planned to visit courthouses across the state. it remains uncertain if moore's directive will delay same-sex marriage in alabama, as some probate judges have pledged to follow the federal court order. the state governor robert bentley's spokeswoman did not comment on the matter. the issue gains attention as the united states moves towards greater marriage equality.
1172	the article discusses how the world's wealthiest individuals, particularly the 9.5 million dollar millionaires, have the potential to significantly contribute to environmental preservation through their vast accumulated wealth. however, the extent to which they are effectively aiding the fight against climate change and environmental degradation depends on their philanthropic actions. some notable billionaires, including bill gates, warren buffett, and richard branson, have already donated billions to various causes. others, such as ted turner, george soros, and luciano benetton, have invested in land conservation. philanthropists have the advantage of being able to quickly fund and initiate projects, but their actions can also face backlash from local communities who question foreign interference and the potential for exploitation of resources. the article also highlights the concern of rainforest inhabitants regarding the displacement caused by philanthropists purchasing large tracts of land. the effectiveness of philanthropic efforts also depends on the wise use of resources and avoiding potentially harmful initiatives, such as george soros' biofuel production in the cerrado region, which is causing significant deforestation.

1211	north korea's 29-year-old leader, kim jong un, has escalated threats against the united states, declared a state of war with south korea, and warned diplomats to evacuate the peninsula over the past month. the obama administration has responded inconsistently, first deploying military assets and then calling for dialogue. historically, north korea has continued its nuclear weapons development despite dialogue and sanctions. the main priority for north korea is the capability to threaten the united states with nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, and it is unlikely to be swayed by offers of respect, aid, or the lifting of sanctions. the regime intends to establish itself as a nuclear weapons power and may continue to break agreements reached during negotiations. north korea poses a danger by pushing the brink of a nuclear weapons test or transferring nuclear technology to other countries. dialogue has not been effective in halting north korea's nuclear program, and sustained pressure is necessary with china's involvement. the united states must avoid making cooperation on north korea a litmus test for u.s.-china ties and instead persuade china to cooperate strategically and genuinely to address the north korean nuclear issue. allies, particularly south korea and japan, are crucial to deterring north korea and motivating china to take action. negotiations with north korea may eventually resume, but a more effective approach is to apply sustained pressure on the regime to constrain its nuclear weapons development and proliferation.

1223	russia was suspended from the g8 group of leading economies on monday after leaders from the remaining seven countries, including britain, the us, germany, france, italy, canada, and japan, condemned russia's "illegal attempt to annex crimea" as a contravention of international law. the leaders agreed to meet again without russia until it was ready to engage in "meaningful discussion." british prime minister david cameron and u.s. president barack obama made it clear that this summer's g8 summit, scheduled to be held in sochi, russia, would be cancelled. instead, it will be held in brussels in june, and putin will not be invited for the first time since russia was admitted to the group in 1998. the move to isolate russia diplomatically came as the u.s. urged european countries to impose tougher economic sanctions, and russian military experts warned that putin could decide in the next two weeks to launch a large-scale invasion of mainland ukraine. the crisis was overshadowing a summit about nuclear security in the hague.
1224	four rhinos were discovered dead with their horns missing at the lalibela game reserve in south africa, making it over 400 rhinos killed in the country this year. in assam, india, two rhinos were also killed and dehorned, with one rhino surviving but ultimately succumbing to her injuries. both incidents sparked outrage and condemnation. the rhinos in south africa were possibly darted prior to their horns being removed in a "very professional" manner, while in india, the rhinos were shot and had their horns hacked off while still alive. the killings occurred during the same week and have raised concerns about the increasing poaching of rhinos for their horns.
1225	the johnsons, a marine corps couple from san diego, are both deploying to afghanistan, leaving their toddler son noah behind for up to a year. they are one of 681 marine corps couples to have deployed together since 2011. frances johnson, who is volunteering for her first deployment, describes the separation as challenging, with negative reactions from some people. her husband's deployment was scheduled but came with a promotion, and together they decided it was best for their careers. the couple's families are helping care for noah during their absence, and they are focused on the positive aspects of reuniting with him when they return.
1226	a detroit-area man, theodore paul wafer, 54, will stand trial on a charge of second-degree murder in the shooting death of 19-year-old renisha mcbride, who was intoxicated and disoriented following a car accident before being shot on wafer's porch in november. prosecutors argued that wafer made a "bad choice" by coming to the door with a shotgun instead of calling for help or answering the door. wafer's friend testified that they had been playing a drinking game with vodka and smoking marijuana that night. wafer, whose lawyer claims he shot mcbride in self-defense, is also charged with manslaughter and possessing a firearm during a felony. prosecutors maintain that there was no evidence of a break-in and mcbride was unarmed when shot from behind a locked door, making wafer's claim of self-defense invalid. wafer's next court appearance is scheduled for january 15.
1227	the syrian capital, damascus, is now divided between rival gunmen supporting and opposing president bashar assad. at least 74 people have been killed in two days of clashes between the syrian free army and government forces. damascus has been under the control of the free syrian army for the past 11 days, and the regime can only disrupt utilities and disrupt communications. cities like homs, hama, and idlib have experienced a significant escalation in violence since tuesday. the syrian observatory for human rights reported a "fierce military campaign" in hamadiyeh district of hama since the early hours of friday. however, the surge in rebellion has caused a spike in deaths, claiming the lives of women and children as well as soldiers. in homs, government forces have resorted to shelling homes and firing on crowds with machine guns. the syrian uprising, which began with peaceful protests last march, has become increasingly violent as army defectors clash with government forces, and some protesters have taken up arms to protect themselves. the violence has intensified the sectarian divide in the sunni-majority country, where assad's alawite sect dominates the regime. the un security council held a closed-door meeting to discuss the crisis and draft a possible resolution against the damascus regime, while the un reports at least 5,400 deaths since march. russia, a key ally of syria, has been criticized for failing to stop the violence and is accused of preventing regime change in syria. syrian rebels express anti-russian sentiment, accusing the putin government of keeping assad in power. russia's discomfort with the resolution's wording could be addressed if the document clearly rules out military intervention, but western and arab states are unlikely to dismiss the use of force entirely. with strong opposition from syria's allies and russia, a resolution that is agreeable to all parties seems unlikely.
1228	wales is considering becoming the first part of the uk to ban electronic cigarettes in enclosed public places due to concerns they glamorize smoking and act as a gateway to traditional cigarettes. ministers in wales, including health minister mark drakeford, fear e-cigarettes, which contain liquid nicotine and mimic the sensation of smoking, could reverse efforts made to discourage smoking. drakeford announced proposals to ban them in pubs, restaurants, and other indoor public spaces as part of a white paper on health reform. the labour-run welsh government believes e-cigarettes could normalize smoking and make it easier for people to transition back to traditional cigarettes. some experts agree, arguing that flavored e-cigarettes, which are often marketed to children, could lead to increased nicotine addiction. however, others think that if all smokers switched to e-cigarettes, it could prevent five million deaths annually. france has also pledged to ban e-cigarettes in public places due to potential health risks. the devices were first invented in 1963, but their popularity has grown significantly in the last decade. some studies suggest that e-cigarettes could be aiding the smoking cessation process, but other research indicates that they could encourage traditional cigarette smoking among teenagers.
1229	five areas in the uk, including aberdeen, bradford, brighton, middlesbrough, and milton keynes, have introduced the requirement for dialling the full area code when making local calls. this change, implemented by telecoms regulator ofcom, aims to create nearly one million new phone numbers and prevent the country from running out of numbers. people in these areas will now have to dial eleven-digit numbers to reach local homes and businesses. the shift is met with skepticism from the public, as demand for new landline numbers may be decreasing due to the increasing use of mobile phones and internet services. this change creates extra costs for small businesses and traders, who need to update their letterheads and signs to show the full number, including the national code. ofcom insists that the changes are necessary to ensure the continued availability of new landline numbers and maintain competition in the telecoms market. the implementation of this system has also been successful in bournemouth since 2012.
1230	in mexico city, monsignor victor rené rodriguez, a high-ranking official in the mexican catholic church, has expressed concern over the increasing threats, extortion, and abuse of priests by drug traffickers. some priests in violent states like chihuaha, where 40% of mexico's drug-related deaths have occurred in the past four years, have had to cancel early evening masses to protect parishioners. threats against priests have also affected evangelical churches, with pastors falsely accused of siding with drug gangs and forced to minister to traffickers. the families of priests are also being threatened. the mexican catholic church has implemented measures to minimize risks to priests, including asking them to wear religious clothing and avoid traveling to remote areas.
1231	george galloway, the bradford west mp, was interviewed by police under caution for declaring bradford an "israel-free zone" in protest against israel's actions in gaza. his remarks sparked outrage and hundreds of complaints, leading to a police investigation. galloway called the probe an attempt to curb his freedom of speech and vowed not to be silenced. the controversy escalated when israel's ambassador to the uk, daniel taub, visited bradford and unfurled an israeli flag, which was described as a deliberate provocation. the crown prosecution service will decide whether charges should follow. galloway won the bradford west seat in a by-election in 2012.
1232	barcelona, known for producing top football talent, has been hit with a two-year transfer ban by fifa for breaking rules on the international transfer of minors. the ban prevents the club from signing players in the next two windows, which could have significant consequences as it limits their ability to refresh their squads and maintain competitiveness, as well as for marketing purposes. fifa's investigation focused on several players under the age of 18 who were registered and played for barcelona between 2009 and 2013. the spanish football federation was also fined chf 500,000. the ban may affect transfer deals barcelona has in progress, such as a potential move for german goalkeeper andre ter stegen from borussia monchengladbach and the arrival of 17-year-old alen halilovic from dinamo zagreb. the ban comes after barcelona president sandro rosell resigned in january over the misappropriation of funds during the signing of neymar in 2013.
1233	christian eriksen credits mauricio pochettino's tough pre-season training regime for tottenhotspur's late-game resilience in the premier league. four of their nine late-game goals have resulted in crucial points, helping them climb up the table with arsenal being the only team snatching more. spurs have showed great character and belief, scoring two-goal salvoes in cup matches. eriksen found the net in the 89th minute against swansea, echoing his late goal against hull city in november. pochettino praised the team's efforts, while eriksen mentioned the grueling pre-season as the cause for their sudden fitness and determination to keep going till the end of games. despite inconsistent performances this season, which has seen them lose six league games, spurs are determined to improve and move up the table.
1234	thousands of protesters in montreal demonstrated against planned tuition hikes and bill 78, which requires demonstration organizers to provide advance notice of routes and details. despite tension from weekend clashes, tuesday's protest remained mostly peaceful, with no arrests reported during the afternoon event. however, six people were arrested later that night when some protesters wearing masks threw objects at police. at least 1,000 arrests have been made since the protests began. classe, a student association, plans to continue demonstrating without providing an approved itinerary. the protests began in response to a proposed tuition increase of $1,625, resulting in clashes between police and protesters, leaving over 300 people arrested and 20 injured. montreal police commander ian lafreniere noted the city is usually peaceful.

1236	republic of ireland captain robbie keane was dropped from the starting lineup for the first time since 2001 for ireland's euro 2016 qualifier against scotland on friday. keane, ireland's all-time leading goalscorer, was among the substitutes during a 1-0 defeat against their group rivals at celtic park. the last time keane was started on the bench was in a world cup qualifier against estonia in june 2001, which ireland won 2-0. martin o'neill chose to start shane long instead due to long's pace, with the southampton striker scoring a couple of goals at the weekend and in good form. keane was brought on in the 78th minute to help ireland find an equaliser. o'neill praised keane before the game, acknowledging his contribution to the team and his goalscoring ability but ultimately deciding that long's pace was the deciding factor.
1237	a pit bull named mickey, who mauled a four-year-old boy in phoenix earlier this year, will spend the rest of its life in an animal shelter instead of being put to death. the dog was offered a home at the maricopa county animal shelter, run by sheriff joe arpaio, an animal lover who intervened in the case. mickey attacked the boy, leaving him with broken eye socket and jaw, requiring months, if not years, of reconstructive surgery. the incident sparked heated debates online, with some blaming the dog's owners and baby sitter for negligence, while others sympathized with the animal. donations poured in for the injured child, with animal advocates arguing both the dog and boy were victims. arpaio, known for his immigration enforcement efforts, testified at the hearing that he would ensure mickey's lifelong care at the shelter, and he expects to remain sheriff to fulfill that commitment. the judge denied a request to rescind the order for mickey to be defanged, stating that the cost of the procedure, $2,500, was a small fraction of the boy's medical bills.
1238	claire craig, a mother-of-two from surrey, ignored a numb, tingling sensation in her right hand, assuming it was caused by her new puppy's nipping. over the next three months, her hand became completely numb, feeling like she was wearing a thick ski glove. the symptoms eventually spread down her leg, but claire, an interior designer, didn't consider it serious as she had no other symptoms. her gp initially suspected carpal tunnel syndrome, but tests came back clear. an mri scan revealed a brain tumour the size of a small aubergine. despite symptoms escalating and a second mri, claire remained calm, unaware that cancer was the cause. the diagnosis changed her life in an instant. despite advancements in cancer research, brain tumours claim around 3,400 lives every year in england and wales. the symptoms are often vague and little is known about the causes or risk factors. brain tumours are rising in number, and although detection rates are improving, most patients still die within a year due to a lack of research and poor prognosis. brain tumours are challenging to remove because of their location, and no single risk factor can accurately predict who will develop one. claire's surgeon couldn't determine the exact type until surgery. she had a hemangioblastoma, a rare, benign tumour that was successfully removed. the three weeks leading up to the operation were the worst of her life. telling her children that she had an egg in her head and needed surgery caused them to be frightened. the operation took longer than anticipated, and she was left paralysed down one side. recovery was a long process, but she regained the use of her hand, walked, talked and ate again within a month. she faced few long-term problems. brain tumours cannot be treated with chemotherapy, and surgery carries risks because of their location and diverse nature. experts are working on using 3d technology to
1239	u.s. presidents barack obama and george w. bush met unexpectedly in tanzania on july 2, 2013, during obama's week-long tour of africa. the two former presidents paid tribute to the victims of the 1998 embassy bombing in dar es salaam, where bush happened to be for a summit on african first ladies. although they didn't make any public statements, their wives, michelle obama and laura bush, engaged in a warm and chatty joint appearance. the two presidents bowed their heads at the memorial for the victims and subsequently had a private discussion. the encounter came as a surprise, as the two leaders hadn't originally planned to meet. during the bombing, 12 people were killed and 85 were injured at the embassy in dar es salaam, while 212 people were killed in nairobi. the attacks were orchestrated by osama bin laden, and the us responded with missile strikes on sudan and afghanistan. in their joint appearance, the first ladies discussed encouraging african first ladies to advocate for causes they are passionate about, despite the media's focus on trivial matters, such as their hairstyles. obama praised bush for his impact on africa through funding aids treatment, and expressed his desire to shift the us approach to africa from aid and assistance to trade and partnership. he also announced a new trade agreement and a program to bring electricity to africans without access to it. during the trip, obama also demonstrated a soccer ball called the sockket ball, which generates electricity during play and can power an led lamp for three hours. the ball was developed by two harvard graduates, and the plan is to distribute it to african children to address the lack of electricity.
1240	the peanut corporation of america's plainview, texas, subsidiary has voluntarily closed after potential salmonella contamination was detected in products, according to state health officials. this comes as an investigation continues into a salmonella outbreak linked to a blakely, georgia, peanut processing plant with eight deaths and around 600 illnesses reported nationwide. the original recall of peanut butter and peanut paste has expanded and now includes products sold to grocery stores, schools, and institutions as well as retail outlets like dollar stores. peanut butter sales have declined significantly, causing companies like conagra foods and j.m. smucker to offer discounts and promotions to maintain business. the plainview plant is cooperating with authorities, and it's unclear if the salmonella strain found there is related to the larger outbreak. the blakely plant was raided by the fbi on monday.
1241	google is lobbying against proposed restrictions on using google glass while driving in at least three states (illinois, delaware, and missouri) as eight us states consider regulations for the new technology. google argues that it's premature to regulate the device, which is not yet widely available, and can cost $1,500 per pair. some legislators, like illinois state senator ira silverstein, want to prevent drivers from wearing google glass due to concerns about distraction and potential accidents. google has deployed lobbyists to persuade elected officials and has been scheduling demonstrations to educate the public about the technology. some lawmakers, like delaware state rep. joseph miro and maryland house of delegates member benjamin kramer, argue that clear state laws are needed to address the issue as it will be difficult for law enforcement to prove when the device is being used while driving. so far, no states have passed google glass restrictions.
1242	edward snowden, a former nsa systems administrator, claimed that he had the authority to target anyone with warrantless surveillance, but this is not accurate. the nsa's "telephony metadata" or business records program involves collecting metadata of americans' calls, such as who called whom, when, and for how long, but not the location or content of the calls. the program was implemented to deal with the challenge of identifying terrorists within the us after the 9/11 attacks and was found to be constitutional by the supreme court. the data is accessed with strict controls, and around 300 times a year, under close supervision, to find potential terrorist predicates. the metadata is not used to listen to calls, but only to determine who communicates with identified terrorists. critics argue that it infringes on privacy, but for those who still object, it's important to differentiate between fact and misinformed media commentary. in the next column, the author will discuss the prism program, which involves the collection of internet content with the help of american firms.
1243	four republican lawmakers, including senators john mccain and lindsey graham, have called for boston bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev to be classified as an "enemy combatant" and not read his miranda rights. they argue that the suspect, who is a naturalized us citizen, should be prioritized for intelligence gathering instead of being informed of his right to remain silent and other miranda warnings. the debate over denying tsarnaev his miranda rights has sparked outrage from civil liberties groups, with the american civil liberties union calling it "un-american." tsarnaev, who is in critical condition, remains at beth israel deaconess medical center, while eleven bombing victims are being treated there as well. the obama administration is reportedly considering seeking the death penalty for tsarnaev. the use of the public safety exception to delay miranda rights is not new, as it was also used in the cases of the christmas day 2009 "underwear bomber" and times square bombing suspect faisal shazad. however, critics argue that such exceptions can lead to abuses and false confessions, making it important to uphold miranda rights even in difficult cases.
1244	fusilier lee rigby, a 25-year-old soldier, was brutally murdered in woolwich, london, in 2013 by two extremists, michael adebolajo and michael adebowale. a campaign was launched to build a memorial site for rigby outside the military barracks where he was killed. however, greenwich council decided not to name the memorial after him due to fear of offending islamic fanatics. instead, the memorial will commemorate all servicemen and women who have served or lived in the area and given their lives. critics have criticized the decision as "disgusting," urging officials to "stand up" to violent extremists. rigby's family has welcomed the location of the memorial at st. george's chapel, which they believe is a fitting tribute. rigby's widow and mother have expressed their support for the council's plans. adebolajo and adebowale were jailed for a minimum of 45 years each for their heinous crime, which sent shockwaves throughout the country and became synonymous with the ongoing struggle against islamist fanatics.

1246	the world health organization (who) declared the democratic republic of congo (drc) free of ebola on friday, marking the end of the country's seventh outbreak of the virus since it was identified in 1976. the declaration came after 42 days had passed since the last confirmed patient tested negative, and there had been no new cases. the who praised the drc's leadership and effective coordination, including the monitoring of those with the disease and their contacts, for achieving this milestone. however, there are ongoing concerns about ebola in other countries, particularly sierra leone and mali. in mali, six cases have been reported, and there are fears that the virus could spread further. u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon and other international leaders have pledged support to help contain the outbreak in west africa, where over 15,000 cases and over 5,000 deaths have been reported. efforts to combat the disease have been hindered by a lack of funding, with the u.n. only raising a fraction of the $1 billion needed for the response.
1247	thierry henry, the former arsenal striker, is making his acting debut in the "entourage" movie in 2015. henry retired from football this month after playing for new york red bulls, and has since joined sky sports as a pundit and expressed interest in becoming arsenal's manager. henry will make a cameo appearance in the film, playing a short scene with actor jeremy piven's character, ari gold. piven praised henry for his role in the film on twitter. henry has also been seen on the film set with ellin, the show's creator, and ufc champion ronda rousey. the movie is set for release in the summer of 2015.

1327	in a highly anticipated supreme court hearing, justices expressed divided views on the individual mandate provision of the 2010 federal health care reform law, which requires most americans to purchase health insurance or face a financial penalty. the fate of this provision and possibly the entire law's other sections hang in the balance as the government's authority to regulate health care under the commerce clause comes under scrutiny. the conservatives on the bench questioned the mandate's constitutionality, with some likening it to the government forcing individuals to buy broccoli. the oral arguments did not mention "obamacare" or president obama by name but were aware of the significant consequences of their eventual rulings. the debate continued outside the court with partisan rhetoric from congressional representatives and protests. while some officials expect the court to uphold the mandate despite challenging questions, opponents, such as sen. rand paul, are optimistic that it will be struck down as an unconstitutional infringement on personal freedom. the high court is expected to rule on all four related issues by late june.

1329	manchester united, under the leadership of sir alex ferguson, were known for their late-show comebacks, scoring many goals in the final moments to secure victories. this tactic helped them win numerous premier league titles, cup ties, and the champions league. opponents were always uncertain when the attack would come, as ferguson's team pressured until the final whistle. however, under current manager louis van gaal, the team's attacking players have been criticized for a lack of discipline, and their latest goal before the 62nd minute was one of their only 13 goals this season. in contrast, united have conceded eight goals beyond the 62 minute mark. the team's inability to score late goals is particularly alarming, considering their defense's porous nature. during ferguson's last decade at manchester united, 38.7% of their goals came in the final 27 minutes and added time. united even managed to keep this trend under david moyes last season, scoring 21 of their 64 league goals after the 63rd minute. to maintain competitiveness, it is crucial for united to rediscover their knack for scoring late goals.

1334	boko haram's abduction of over 200 schoolgirls in northeast nigeria has gained significant global attention, with condemnation from u.s. president barack obama and uk prime minister david cameron. this publicity is valuable to boko haram, which sees itself as a militant islamic group on a suicide mission to wage war against the west. bornu state in nigeria, one of the poorest and most neglected areas in the world, is now the new battleground between militant islam and the western world. the nigerian government's neglect of the northeast and its people, as well as its lack of response to the abduction, has fueled anger and despair. the remote, dry, and dusty region, rich in oil but lacking in basic services and infrastructure, has become a place of concern for the us and its allies. the u.s. secretary of state, john kerry, has criticized nigeria for ignoring previous offers of help to address the security situation in the northeast. the nigerian authorities' lack of democratic relationship with the people of the northeast, combined with high levels of poverty, unemployment, and lack of education and health services, creates a volatile situation. boko haram began as a fundamentalist movement in 2002, gaining momentum after the death of its leader, mohammed yusuf, in police custody. the ineffective security forces, deep-rooted corruption, and lack of governance have given boko haram an opportunity to expand its influence. the military's heavy-handed approach to dealing with the group has failed to address the underlying causes of the conflict, and a long-term plan for development and investment is needed to bring peace and stability to the region. the u.s. faces a challenge in balancing military intervention and development assistance to make the people of the northeast feel part of a booming nigerian economy. a failure to address the root causes of the conflict could lead to more violent uprisings in the future.

1393	the centre for social justice (csj), a think tank founded by former work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith, has proposed a plan to help the long-term unemployed move house to find work by providing financial aid. anyone out of work for over a year would be eligible for assistance with moving costs, such as hiring a removals van or paying a deposit on a new home. the csj argues that people on benefits in social housing are less likely to be employed and fewer are likely to move to find work. critics may compare this plan to norman tebbit's 1980s suggestion for the jobless to "get on their bikes," but the term was actually used in a different context. the pilot scheme, which could use funds from discretionary housing payments, would only apply to those with a concrete job offer that requires a longer commute. the csj acknowledged the need for a managed approach to prevent population imbalances. critics have stated that current rules discourage the unemployed from seeking work in areas with booming labor markets due to financial barriers. people in social housing are less likely to be employed and more likely to remain in the same house for extended periods due to the cost of moving. a representative from yarlington housing group stated that a £250 moving assistance fund can make a difference for residents looking to move to take up a job. the department for work and pensions indicated that the plan is not currently under consideration but will be reviewed by ministers.

1444	a two-year-old english bulldog named hugo has formed an unusual bond with two young cubs, a white lion named igor and a white bengal tiger named ice, whom he has adopted as his own pups. the cubs, who are being hand-reared by their owner, or lazmi, a former vet assistant, live together with hugo in port elizabeth, south africa. igor and ice, who weigh around two-and-a-half stone each, are rapidly growing and will eventually weigh over 28 stone and almost 40 stone, respectively. hugo, who can currently still bully them around, plays and interacts with the cubs regularly, even disciplining them when necessary. the three animals go on family outings to walk and swim together, and the cubs spend their days at seaview predator park before returning to live with hugo and or lazmi in the evenings. their relationship will be closely monitored to ensure that the cubs do not see hugo as prey, as they will need to interact with park vets when they grow up.
1445	u.s. rep. allen west, a florida republican, made controversial comments during a town hall meeting when he suggested that there are around 78 to 81 communist members in the democratic party in congress. these accusations drew little criticism from fellow republicans, and west even raised funds off the comment. the number was likely based on the congressional progressive caucus, a liberal organization. the comparison of liberal democrats to communists is inappropriate as communists have caused millions of deaths throughout the 20th century. this type of rhetoric, equating political ideologies, is a worrying sign of the polarized political climate, with extreme statements being employed for fundraising purposes. the text emphasizes the growing polarization in american politics, in which ideas to the left of center are often demonized as extreme, while members of one party are compared to dangerous ideologies like communism or fascism. this leads to a distorted perspective and a cycle of incitement. the author calls for condemnation of extreme comments from both sides of the political spectrum to prevent further polarization. the comparison of allen west to joe mccarthy is made, yet west's remarks are seen as less extreme and not as powerful as mccarthy's witch hunts. however, the increasingly divisive rhetoric in american politics is a serious concern and requires attention.
1446	jim murphy, the frontrunner to be the new labor leader in scotland, has announced his support for full devolution of income tax to edinburgh, including a proposed 50p top rate for the wealthiest scots. this move comes despite objections from senior labor figures, who fear it could undermine the integrity of the uk and potentially bar scottish mps from voting on uk tax affairs in the future. the smith commission, tasked with recommending additional powers for the scottish parliament following scotland's rejected independence referendum, is expected to propose devolving more control over income tax. the labor party has previously advocated for control over 75% of the basic rate of income tax in scotland, but murphy's announcement could lead to major constitutional and economic implications for the entire uk.

1450	a growing number of stores are selling "zombie bullets" manufactured by hornady, a company that was inspired by the cultural phenomenon of zombies and the walking dead series. the bullets, called z-max, are live ammunition intended for target practice only. simultaneously, there have been reports of cannibal attacks in the us, with suspects allegedly under the influence of a drug called "cloud nine." this drug, which is marketed as bath salts, is a synthetic stimulant that can cause violent and erratic behavior, hallucinations, and a strong compulsion to take more of the drug. the attacks include rudy eugene, who ate most of a homeless man's face, and brandon de león, who threatened to eat two officers in miami and bit an officer's hand during custody. another attacker, carl jacquneaux, allegedly bit off a chunk of todd credeur's face during a domestic dispute in louisiana. the police have issued a warning regarding the dangers of cloud nine and urged officers to exercise caution when dealing with suspicious individuals, pointing out that it resembles the incidents in miami and in a separate case involving canadian man luka rocco magnotta, who is accused of killing and dismembering his partner before posting body parts to authorities.
1451	a judge, nigel peters qc, who described a 13-year-old victim of child sexual abuse as a "predator" and allowed a paedophile, neil wilson, to walk free with a suspended sentence last week, was forced to alter the sentence due to a technicality but did not apology or jail him. investigations are ongoing as to whether the sentence is too lenient. the prosecution barrister, robert colover, who described the victim as "predatory" and "sexually experienced" during the trial, has been suspended from prosecuting sexual offence cases. colover's comments were condemned by child protection campaigners and former prime minister david cameron, who urged the courts to "stand up for victims." wilson, who admitted possessing extreme pornographic images and one count of sexual activity with a child, was given a 12-month suspended sentence, with consecutive terms for the image charges. the prosecution and judges' comments about the victim sparked outrage and investigations from the attorney general's office, charity victim support, and the bar standards board.

1453	a small group of people rallied outside the japanese embassy in washington d.c. on saturday to support american man christopher savoie, who is currently jailed in japan after being accused of trying to kidnap his own children. savoie, a tennessee native and naturalized japanese citizen, allegedly took his two children, aged 8 and 6, when they were being walked to school by their mother in rural japan in august. he attempted to obtain passports for them at the u.s. consulate in fukuoka but was arrested by japanese police before he could enter the consulate compound. savoie's wife, amy, along with members of the children's rights council of japan, called for his release during the demonstration. the couple, who were married for 14 years and had joint custody of the children, are currently going through a complicated custody battle because they are still considered married in japan due to their lack of divorce. japanese law follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces and does not recognize the u.s. court's decision of granting savoie sole custody. the case is further complicated by the fact that the children have japanese passports and japan is not a party to the 1980 hague convention on international child abduction. savoie is currently jailed for at least 10 days while japanese prosecutors investigate the case. savoie's wife amy expressed her hope for her husband's release and her desire to be able to speak with him.
1454	chelsea new signing cesc fabregas, who was acquired from barcelona for £27 million before the world cup, is set to join the team immediately and fit in seamlessly due to his previous experience of living and playing in england. fabregas, who was told he was not needed by arsenal manager arsene wenger before leaving for barcelona, will be a "perfect fit" for chelsea, according to manager jose mourinho, who has been in africa as a un world food programme ambassador instead of watching the world cup. mourinho and fabregas have a history of opposition, due to their time with real madrid and barcelona, respectively. fabregas and the spanish team have had a disappointing world cup, already being knocked out.

1493	a team of international researchers has found that partly melting ice in greenland is caused by heat from the earth's mantle, making it the first known connection between the melting greenland ice sheet and high heat flow from the earth's interior. this discovery, which could have implications for future climate change predictions, comes as the greenland ice sheet loses about 227 gigatonnes of ice per year, contributing to about 0.7 millimeters to the current sea level rise per year. researchers at the gfz german research centre for geosciences suggest that the earth's mantle's effect on current climate modeling is too simplistic. by modeling the earth's mantle against the ice sheet, they discovered that melting occurs in specific areas due to the mantle's composition beneath it. additionally, two studies propose a technological solution to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the north pole. david keith, a professor at harvard university, suggests injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere or using a few modified gulfstream jets to restore the polar ice, which could cost around $8 billion a year. however, keith doesn't yet fully advocate for this solution, emphasizing the need to tackle pollution instead. overall, these findings contribute to a more accurate understanding of the processes contributing to the melting of the greenland ice sheet.

1605	blue light-emitting diodes (leds), which were awarded the nobel prize in physics last week for their energy efficiency and longevity, have been found to attract more insects than sodium-vapour lights, according to a new study by new zealand-based institute scion. while leds are more environmentally-friendly than traditional incandescent bulbs, insects, particularly moths and flies, are more strongly attracted to the blue spectrum of light emitted by leds. the study, which involved catching and labelling over 20,000 insects, revealed that simply changing the spectrum of leds did not reduce their attractiveness to insects. three japanese-born scientists, isamu akasaki, hiroshi amano, and shuji nakamura, were awarded the nobel prize in physics for inventing leds in the 1990s. nakamura, who invented the blue led while working for the nichia corporation in japan in 1993, was initially awarded only 20,000 yen (£125 or $200) for his invention, despite its potential worth of £50 billion ($80 billion) by 2020. the concern is that the increased use of led lighting could have negative impacts on insect populations, disrupting the food chain and causing flies to be thrown off their usual paths into the jaws of predators. the study also raised concerns about the potential attraction of led lighting near ports, where flying pests, such as the gypsy moth, could be accidentally transported by ships.

1713	scientists at bangor university have defended their decision to kill the world's oldest-recorded animal, a 507-year-old clam named ming, amid criticism that they did so to determine its age. ming was discovered on the coast of iceland in 2006 and was initially believed to be around 400 years old based on the number of rings in its shell. however, after further analysis, researchers determined the clam was actually 507 years old, making it the oldest recorded animal. the researchers, including climate scientist dr. paul butler, have noted that large creatures generally live longer than small ones, and ming's long life may be attributed to its slow metabolism. ming was part of a larger study on climate change and was frozen and transported to the lab for examination. the findings mean that ming was born seven years after columbus discovered america and lived through historical milestones such as the english civil war and two world wars.
1714	a family court judge in london has allowed a mother to change the surname of her three-year-old twin sons due to the "bizarre conduct" of their father on his blog. the father, who is embroiled in litigation about contact with his children, has created a protest blog which he updates daily, referring to his estranged wife as a "drug-addicted alcoholic" and posting extensive details of their litigation and their children's names. judge ross duggan ruled that the desire to preserve the paternal link through the children's surname must give way to their protection from their father's publications. the judge noted that at an older age, the children may encounter web-based insults to their mother or other harmful material associated with their names. the father's activities cannot be stopped at the source, but the harmful consequences can be prevented by allowing the children's name change in their best interests.
1715	a new study by researchers at illinois university has found that physically fit nine and ten-year-olds have more white matter in their brains, which is associated with better memory and attention. the study, which used brain imaging, showed that those with higher levels of aerobic fitness had brains with more fibrous and compact white matter. previous studies suggest that children with higher levels of aerobic fitness have larger gray matter brain regions important for memory and learning. the researchers analyzed data from 24 children using diffusion tensor imaging and found significant fitness-related differences in the integrity of several white matter tracts in the brain, which play a role in attention and memory. the research builds on previous work showing that fitness is linked to white matter integrity in older adults, suggesting that the benefits of fitness for the brain may extend throughout the lifespan. the team is now conducting a five-year trial to determine whether white matter tract integrity improves in children who begin a new physical fitness routine and maintain it.

1718	a ukrainian military transport plane was likely shot down near the country's eastern border, possibly by a rocket fired from russia, according to ukraine's defense minister. the rebels in eastern ukraine, who have been involved in a conflict with the government in kiev, claimed responsibility for downing the an-26 plane, which may have been carrying up to 20 people. the ukrainian defense minister stated that the plane was flying at an altitude of 21,300 feet, which is too high for separatists' weapons to reach. in the last two weeks, ukrainian forces have retaken several villages around the rebel-controlled cities of luhansk and donetsk, and have reopened a corridor to luhansk's civilian airport. pro-russian rebels have claimed that ukrainian jets carried out five air strikes against their positions and that kiev had massed tanks in the outskirts of luhansk in preparation for a major push into the city. however, the russian defense ministry denied these claims and reported that ukrainian soldiers had publicly nailed a three-year-old boy to a board in a former rebel stronghold as an act of revenge. the russian and ukrainian governments have been engaged in a conflict over the eastern regions of ukraine, where mostly russian-speaking regions have declared independence from the government in kiev. fighting intensified around luhansk as ukrainian forces stepped up efforts to disrupt rebel lines and reclaim territory from the faltering insurgency. meanwhile, russia has threatened "surgical retaliatory strikes" on ukrainian territory following reports that people in russia were killed and wounded after being struck by shells from across the border. moscow claims that ukrainian forces have been firing into russian territory, and a russian citizen was reportedly killed when a shell exploded in a border town. rebels have also started using a su-25 attack aircraft against ukrainian forces. the conflict, which has been ongoing for over three months, has resulted in almost 6
1719	manitoba mother kristen bartkiw was fined $10 by her kids' daycare after they determined her home-cooked lunches, consisting of leftover roast beef, potatoes, carrots, milk, and oranges, were unbalanced as they lacked ritz crackers, which the daycare workers considered a grain. bartkiw, who was also on the daycare board at the time, found the fine absurd as it flew in the face of what she believed was a healthy and well-rounded meal for her children. the incident, which occurred in late 2012, highlighted a disconnect between the canadian food guide's requirements and what is considered nutritious for kids. according to the guide, daycare meals must include one milk, one meat, one grain, and two fruits or vegetables, with parents being charged $5 per child for each missing item. bartkiw noted that processed and junk foods are still considered acceptable under the guide as long as they adhere to the specified food groups, which led to her criticizing the system and encouraging parents to consider more real food options. manitoba has since implemented a hot lunch program in daycares to address the issue of less-than-balanced lunches.

1768	scientists have discovered why most people can detect the distinct aroma of an approaching rainstorm. they found that when a raindrop hits an uneven surface like soil or leaves, it traps bubbles of air that shoot upwards and burst from the top of the water droplet. these tiny bubbles carry aromatic particles of oil and dust from the surface, which can then be carried for miles by gusts of wind ahead of the rainstorm. this explanation was derived from high-speed camera studies of water droplets impacting various surfaces. additionally, scientists have been using high-precision laser profilometry with high-speed photographs to understand what happens to debris when an asteroid impacts the earth, as it's impossible to study real asteroid impacts. they found that the liquid 'debris' created by an asteroid impact spreads out in a similar way as when raindrops hit soft sand. this finding could help explain how some soil-based bacteria spread diseases by being carried in the air. the researchers at mit conducted 600 experiments on 28 different surfaces and found that light showers and moderate rain produce more aerosols than heavy rain or thunderstorms, and the type of soil also influences aerosol release, particularly on clay or sandy soil.

1793	professor howard milchberg of the university of maryland believes that using an "air waveguide" could enable long-distance communication and various applications like high-resolution topographic mapping, pollution detection, and even laser weapons, by making air behave like an optical fiber. this is achieved by using short, powerful laser pulses to create filaments, which in turn create a wall of low-density air surrounding a core of higher density air, acting as a guide for light beams. the team successfully transmitted light through an air waveguide created in this manner and recorded a stronger signal compared to an unguided signal. future experiments aim to demonstrate the viability of using air waveguides over longer distances for remote chemical analysis and other applications.

1814	bobby hogg, the last known speaker of the cromarty fisherfolk dialect, a unique scottish language originating from a remote fishing village, has passed away. the dialect, which was distinct from standard english with no "wh" pronunciation and no "h" aspiration, has now become extinct. this is the first extinct dialect in scotland, according to robert millar, a linguistics reader at aberdeen university. the decline of cromarty fisherfolk is symptomatic of a broader trend of language loss, with over 6,000 to 7,000 languages in the world disappearing at a rate of one every two weeks. the loss of languages represents the loss of diversity, stories, and cultural knowledge. the dialect's decline was influenced by the industrialization of fishing practices and the shift towards the dominant english language in scotland. efforts are being made to save other endangered dialects, such as the one in avoch, and to increase literacy in and appreciation for the scots language. the scots language has faced stigma and marginalization, but recent efforts toward its preservation include increased publishing and government support.

1816	former manchester city and ac milan soccer player mario balotelli, 23, has admitted on twitter that he is the father of his 18-month-old daughter pia, who was born in december 2012. balotelli had previously denied paternity despite his ex-girlfriend raffaella fico's confirmation.the two engaged in a public and bitter battle in the italian media, with balotelli launching legal action against his parents who were dragged into the dispute. balotelli had refused to see pia before finally agreeing to meet her this weekend when ac milan play in naples. balotelli and fico split in april 2012 after she found out about his infidelities. he is currently in a relationship with model fanny neguesha and has posted pictures of them on twitter. balotelli has been linked with a return to the premier league, with chelsea reportedly interested.
1817	alexis sanchez's excellent performance against hull city led to calls for him to be named premier league player of the year, but such claims are unwarranted as any decent player would look good in arsenal's side. sanchez has been good, but not consistent, and there have been periods where he went missing. he has not significantly improved arsenal over last season, and his teammates have underperformed at times as well. manchester united's david de gea, cesc fabregas, eden hazard, david silva, sergio aguero, and wayne rooney are among the players being considered for the award. however, manchester united's big-money signings have been injured for considerable portions of the season, and radamel falcao's high wages have not translated into results. manchester united's player most likely to win the award is wayne rooney, who has taken on the captaincy roles at both manchester united and england while delivering goals and helping integrate young players into the team amidst the pressure of leading them back into the top four. rooney's leadership has also resulted in a 100% record with england as captain.

1819	the supreme court, in a 7-2 decision, upheld kentucky's use of lethal injection as a constitutional means of executing prisoners, ruling that the three-drug cocktail used does not constitute "cruel and unusual punishment." the ruling comes after kentucky inmates ralph baze and clyde bowling jr. challenged the state's procedure, claiming that the first drug, sodium thiopental, wears off too quickly and leaves prisoners awake and feeling pain during the execution. the court ruled that inmates had not proven that the risk of pain from poorly administered procedures, and the lack of adoption of new alternatives, justifies a constitutional challenge. the ruling allows states to resume executions and provides guidance on the constitutionality of lethal injection procedures. the dissenting justices urged states to consider alternatives to minimize the risk of causing severe and unnecessary pain. baze was convicted of killingtwo lawmen in kentucky in 1992, while bowling was sentenced for the1990 murder of a couple and the wounding of their 2-year-old son in louisville. a texas inmate was executed in september, but the supreme court subsequently imposed a de facto moratorium on executions while considering this appeal. the court had spent six months debating the threshold for unconstitutional execution procedures, and both sides were hoping for clear guidelines. different states and judges have applied varying standards for inmates seeking to challenge the method of execution. recent executions in florida and ohio faced significant issues in administering the lethal injection procedures.

1821	the consumer product safety commission (cpsc) is suing the maker of high-powered magnet desk toys, maxfield & oberton, to stop selling their products due to risks of intestinal injuries from swallowing. at least a dozen incidents of ingestion of buckyballs and buckycubes magnets have occurred since 2009, requiring multiple surgeries and prolonged hospitalization. the company, which markets the products to adults, has warning labels and a public awareness campaign about magnet safety. cpsc has received over 200 reports of magnet ingestions since 2008, with over 20 of high-powered magnets. the commission worked with the company on recalls and education, but injuries continued. the agency filed an administrative complaint against maxfield & oberton and several retailers have agreed to stop selling the magnets. the cpsc rarely files such lawsuits and said parents need to be aware of the hazard, as ingestion of two or more magnets can cause infections and require emergency surgery. braylon jordan, whose son swallowed eight magnets, is relieved about the cpsc's action. mattel ceo also mentioned the importance of rigorous standards after a massive toy recall.
1822	a jetblue airways plane en route to palm beach international airport from westchester county airport in new york made an emergency landing at kennedy airport this morning after striking a bird. the airbus a320, carrying 142 passengers, collided with the bird about 25 minutes after takeoff. the pilots declared an emergency and diverted the plane to jfk as a precaution. the incident resulted in no injuries, and the port authority confirmed the report of a bird strike. a bird carcass was found lodged in the plane's nose, and there appeared to be a hole and bird's blood on the aircraft. the faas will investigate the incident, and the bird species was not immediately identified. this emergency landing shares similarities to the "miracle on the hudson" incident in 2009 when a us airways flight struck geese after departing laguardia, and the pilot made a successful emergency landing in the hudson river, with all 155 people on board surviving.

1845	in a tv talk show years ago, four men claimed reverse discrimination against them due to affirmative action programs and blamed "black women" for stealing their jobs. the speaker questioned their entitlement and title of the show, arguing men felt they owned the positions. suzanne venker's piece condemned feminist women for unhappy male-female relationships, contending women have emasculated men and destroyed the relationship between the sexes. venker's argument mirrors historical anti-feminist claims that women are responsible for men's unhappiness, despite lack of empirical basis. the speaker criticized venker's piece for perpetuating the harmful "good women/bad men" notion. the real situation, they asserted, shows men adapting to gender equality and evolving roles, and the evidence suggests that men are not as unhappy or resentful as venker suggests. men demand equal respect and equal treatment, rather than being portrayed as biologically predetermined beings. the gendered roles perpetuated in venker's argument are damaging, and men refuse to accept male-bashing or the notion that they cannot be happy in an equal society. the speakers advocate for men and women as allies and the ongoing progress towards gender equality.

1849	the un intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) has issued a new report urging governments to phase out the use of fossil fuels by the end of the century to limit global temperature increases to 2°c. the report warns that continued greenhouse gas emissions will cause "severe, pervasive and irreversible" impacts worldwide, and urges a 70% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. however, critics warn that relying on renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels could increase the risk of power blackouts and soaring energy bills. britain, which currently depends on fossil fuels for more than two-thirds of its electricity, faces particular challenges in making the switch. the ipcc report suggests that fossil fuels could continue to be used beyond 2100 if carbon capture and storage technology is developed on a large scale. however, critics argue that this is an expensive and unproven solution, and that phasing out fossil fuels before reliable green energy sources are available could negatively impact living standards. the report also suggests various adaptation measures, including changing diets and growing new types of food, to mitigate the impacts of climate change. it will act as a guide for governments as they prepare for un climate talks in paris next year.

1864	a pharmacist named sarah sellers warned congress in 2003 about non-sterile conditions in compounding pharmacies, expressing concern over the absence of federal guidelines. ten years later, in 2012, a meningitis outbreak linked to contaminated steroid injections from the massachusetts-based new england compounding center (necc) resulted in 137 cases and 12 fatalities. the steroid, methylprednisolone acetate, was used for pain and inflammation treatment and was contaminated with a fungus. more than 75 medical facilities in 23 states received the potentially contaminated drug. due to a lack of federal jurisdiction, compounding pharmacies like necc have been largely self-regulated with inconsistent application of professional standards. rep. edward markey (d-massachusetts) and rep. rosa delauro (d-connecticut) plan to introduce bills to strengthen the fda's oversight of compounding pharmacies. current guidelines are outdated, and the fda has been working on new ones since at least 2006, but the process is still ongoing. compounding pharmacies originally served to create custom medications, but have evolved into large-scale operations. nearly 10 percent of drugs administered in the u.s. come from compound pharmacies, with some shipping thousands of custom drugs across the country. the fda urges anyone who has experienced any issues following an injection with the necc product to report it.
1865	a us researcher, ken buesseler from the woods hole oceanographic institution, reported that radiation levels in fish caught near the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant remain elevated, indicating ongoing contamination of pacific waters. the majority of fish caught off japan show no sign of radiation at levels dangerous to humans, but close to the plant, cesium-134 and cesium-137 levels imply continued release of cesium into the food chain. the sources are likely sediment on the sea floor or groundwater seeping into the ocean, and researchers can't definitively determine which is the cause. the plant is no longer venting radioactive steam, but not all contaminated water is being recovered, and mutant butterflies have also been linked to the nuclear disaster. the operators have admitted downplaying the risk in the past. japanese authorities have banned fish with cesium levels above 100 becquerels per kilogram, but levels between 1,000 and 10,000 have been found, and two greenling fish tested above 25,000 bq/kg. the tokyo electric power company, the operator of the plant, said it is monitoring radiation contamination and has implemented preventative measures, but there is uncertainty and fear in the japanese public regarding the truth about the situation.

1974	secretary of state john kerry, just nine months into his tenure, successfully negotiated an interim deal with iran regarding its nuclear program, marking the most significant cooperation between the u.s. and iran in decades. the deal, which includes other world powers, has been criticized by israel and some members of congress but praised by kerry as a positive first step. previous efforts towards a nuclear agreement, such as a tentative deal in 2009 and economic sanctions, had stalled. private, clandestine discussions between u.s. and iranian officials resumed after hassan rouhani's election as iranian president, culminating in a telephone conversation between barack obama and rouhani. kerry's diplomatic efforts have yielded success in syria and iran, making him an "activist" negotiator. the real challenge begins now in securing a long-term nuclear agreement with iran, and the impact on the middle east peace process remains to be seen.
1975	lewis hamilton claimed the most important race of his formula one career at the abu dhabi grand prix, defeating teammate and rival nico rosberg before the first turn. the title decider was defined by the fraction of a second between hamilton's car making its move and the encouragement from the final go light. despite losing the race after turn one, rosberg's mechanical failure resulted in him finishing in 14th place, unable to share the glory with hamilton. hamilton secured his second championship title with a victory, finishing with 384 points to rosberg's 317, and eleven race wins to rosberg's five. hamilton was praised for his bravery and determination in securing the championship while rosberg was criticized for his weekend performances. despite technical issues, hamilton's sheer will and daring eclipsed rosberg's german efficiency, resulting in a visceral and unforgettable finish to the season.

1977	former prime minister tony blair received a briefing from the ministry of defense (mod) about unidentified flying objects (ufos) due to concerns over the disclosure of classified information regarding extraterrestrial life forms. the briefing came in 1998, as the freedom of information act was being introduced, allowing public access to information on ufos and alien mysteries. reports of ufo sightings, including a police officer's account of a mysterious object hovering over stamford bridge during a chelsea vs. manchester united fa cup quarter-final replay in 1999, are among the over 6,700 pages of mod files being released by the national archives, following the closure of the mod's ufo desk in 2009. nick pope, a ufo expert, believes aliens may be visiting earth for purposes such as military reconnaissance, scientific research, or to enjoy the scenery. whilemanchester united player andy cole was busy with the game, a 'credible witness report' describes a police officer's sighting of a ufo during the match. pope, who worked at the mod for 20 years, began his research as a skeptic but later became convinced of the potential implications for national security and air safety. he predicts mass summer events like the london olympics could be a prime time for extraterrestrial beings to reveal themselves to humanity.
1978	the international consumer electronics show (ces) has seen at&t and sprint announce plans for new, faster 4g long-term evolution (lte) networks, leaving some customers with last year's 4g smartphones feeling outdated. both at&t and sprint have previously marketed their 4g networks, with at&t adding the moniker to many phones since early last year and sprint announcing its first 4g device in 2010. verizon wireless has also had an lte network since 2010, but is currently matching the coverage of its 3g network and kept a low profile at ces this year. at&t introduced eight new lte products at the show, including the world's first lte windows phone, while sprint announced three devices and expects its new lte network to match its older one by the end of 2012, after which it will stop selling devices that support the old network and turn it off in 2015. apple refuses to label the iphone 4s as a 4g device despite using hspa+ technology that at&t also calls 4g. at&t executive glenn lurie and sprint product chief fared adib declined to comment on marketing plans, while lurie stated that the name doesn't matter and verizon technical chief david small emphasized the importance of clarifying the difference between 4g and 4g lte.
1979	in washington, d.c., a mother, banita jacks, is charged with killing her four daughters, aged 5 to 17, whose decomposing bodies were discovered in her apartment. jacks told authorities that the children had been possessed by demons and died during a seven- to 10-day period in their sleep. the bodies had been undiscovered for at least 15 days, according to the chief medical examiner. jacks is being held without bail and faces life in prison if convicted. preliminary findings indicate that brittany was stabbed to death and aja died from blunt force trauma and possible strangulation. all four children were found in unfurnished bedrooms, two in one room and one in another, with white t-shirts on. a witness reported seeing jacks withhold food from her older daughter, brittany, and once leaving her on her mother's porch unattended for more than 10 hours. authorities are investigating how the children's absences went unnoticed. the family had had contact with child welfare caseworkers and the police. mayor adrian fenty said, "there may be other contacts with the government in the case of the jacks family."
1980	a tragic accident occurred during an airshow at the tampa north flight center in florida when experienced skydiver mark curto, 62, fell to his death after his parachute failed to open during a wing walking stunt or a skydiving jump, according to conflicting reports. witnesses and neighbors reported seeing curto falling from the bi-plane in front of horrified spectators, including children, and his body landed in the backyard of a house in the grand oaks subdivision in land o'lakes. the sheriff's office and the federal aviation administration are investigating the incident, which is the third fatal skydiving accident in the tampa bay area in the past three years. curto's body was discovered shortly after the incident, and no medical condition is believed to have caused his fall. curto was an experienced skydiver and had lost his wife to breast cancer earlier this year.
1981	housing and urban development secretary shaun donovan, in charge of long-term sandy recovery, has caused controversy by suggesting that some areas devastated by the storm may not be worth rebuilding. donovan made the comment during a news conference on december 13, 2012, stating that a "very small share" of homes "may not make sense to rebuild at all." thousands of homes were destroyed and billions of dollars in damage were caused when sandy struck on october 29, 2012. the governors of new york, new jersey, and connecticut, along with over 125 prominent ceos based in new york, have urged congress to quickly approve $60 billion in aid for the affected states. in an op-ed, the governors wrote that americans come together in times of crisis, and it's time for congress to do the same. they noted that the region is critical for american business and the largest contributor to federal tax revenues. donovan also mentioned the need to consider sea barriers and other protective measures for low-lying areas. the aid package requested by president obama includes about three-quarters of what the states had requested. congress is currently in budget negotiations, making the request more challenging. senator charles schumer (d-ny) and rep. peter king (r-ny) are advocating for the aid package to be a bipartisan priority.
1982	a new study published in the archives of internal medicine found that older women taking multivitamins or certain dietary supplements, particularly iron, may have a slightly increased risk of earlier death. the study included data from 38,772 women in iowa over a 22-year period. while calcium was linked to a lower risk of death, folic acid, vitamin b6, magnesium, zinc, copper, and multivitamins were associated with an increased risk. the researchers point out that the findings are association, not causation, and have some limitations, including self-reported supplement intake and the potential for underlying health conditions influencing the results. it's unclear if these findings apply to all older women and if additional research is needed to clarify the role of dietary supplements in health and mortality.
1983	police in ticknall, derbyshire, have asked volunteers armed with a speed gun to stop clocking drivers breaking the law due to overwhelming paperwork. the group, who have carried out 10 speeding operations on the a514 main road, have caught around 200 motorists exceeding the 30mph limit. however, the police can no longer handle the resulting administration and have announced a new road safety scheme with a crackdown on problem areas, including the a514. the volunteers will stand down, but their efforts have contributed to the identification of the road as a focus for the partnership. the increased workload from the speed watches has resulted in the police asking for reasonable limits on their frequency and duration.
1984	england's soccer team, led by captain steven gerrard and players like daniel sturridge, alex oxlade-chamberlain, james milner, joe hart, ross barkley, and phil jagielka, arrived in rio de janeiro, brazil to begin their world cup campaign. after an eight-and-a-half hour flight from miami, they checked into a hotel near ipanema beach, taking in the stunning views and sharing them on social media. players were seen standing on their balconies, taking photos, and admiring the scenery. england's first match is against italy on june 14.
1985	a report by the hollywood reporter alleging that the american humane association (aha), which is responsible for animal welfare in the film industry, turns a blind eye to abuse due to its close relationship with hollywood, has been criticized by the aha as misleading. the report highlighted incidents of animal cruelty on films such as "life of pi," "the hobbit," "pirates of the caribbean," and "war horse." however, aha senior advisor karen rosa defended the organization, stating that the report distorts its work and that the allegations about specific incidents were either exaggerated or taken out of context. the aha confers the "no animals were harmed" stamp on films it has monitored and has a high safety record. however, veteran animal protection prosecutor bob ferber criticized the aha's relationship with the industry, suggesting a conflict of interest.
1986	rep. john boehner (r-oh) was sworn in as the 61st speaker of the house on wednesday, marking the republican party's takeover of the chamber after a four-year democratic hold. ninety-four new house members and 13 new senators were also sworn in, making the house the largest freshman class with no previous elective office experience since 1948. boehner, first elected in 1990, rose to the top position after being voted out of the house leadership in 1998. he promised "an honest debate" and "a fair and open process" while acknowledging the need for "hard work and tough decisions." minority democrats, led by outgoing speaker nancy pelosi, vowed to work together on issues such as helping the middle class, creating jobs, and reducing the deficit. the new rules governing the house require constitutional authority statements for all new legislation.
1987	taco bell's new breakfast menu has been launched in the u.s., and its president, brian niccol, has jokingly stated that it will come to canada if justin bieber is taken back. the fast food chain hopes to compete with mcdonald's in the breakfast market, which dominates with a 31% share. niccol revealed during a reddit ama that sales in colorado have increased by 420% since marijuana was legalized. to promote its breakfast menu, taco bell ran ads featuring men named ronald mcdonald, who are not affiliated with mcdonald's. the chain aims to boost sales by opening most of its u.s. stores earlier at 7 a.m., but has a long way to go to catch up with mcdonald's in the breakfast market. niccol expects to increase breakfast sales to a level "much greater than 4%," and the ads feature ronald mcdonalds expressing their approval of taco bell's breakfast menu.
1988	president barack obama hosted the first-ever white house summit on community colleges on tuesday, aiming to explore ways to reach his goal of an additional 5 million community college degrees by 2020, and discuss the role of community colleges in developing the u.s. workforce. the bill and melinda gates foundation announced a $34.8 million investment over five years for a program called completion by design, while the aspen prize for community college excellence will award $1 million to colleges with outstanding academic and workforce outcomes. the summit brought together 150 people, including community college leaders, students, philanthropists, businesspeople, and policy leaders. community colleges have seen enrollment surge, but have been forced to cut back due to the recession, with only about 30% of students finishing associate degrees within three years. obama announced on monday the skills for america's future initiative, offering more than $2 billion in competitive funds over four years, in partnership with corporations to develop job training programs.
1989	a terrorist group called isis has caused distress for businesses in the united states and elsewhere that have the same name. options for businesses include changing the name, suing the group for trademark infringement, or keeping the name and hoping customers don't get spooked. many businesses have opted for the first option. for instance, the fx cartoon series "archer" has dropped "isis" as the acronym for its spy agency. the mobile payment service "isis wallet" has also changed its name to "softcard." small businesses are also being affected, such as the "isis hookah cafe" in queens, new york. however, some argue that the fear caused by the terrorist group's name is unwarranted and that businesses should keep their names to avoid being dictated to by the group. some suggest using the name isil instead of isis to avoid confusion. isil stands for the islamic state of iraq and the levant. california-based isis pharmaceuticals has decided to keep its name, stating that people can distinguish between the two.
1990	in london's financial district, bankers heeded warnings to dress down to avoid attention from g-20 protestors, opting for jeans and sneakers instead of suits and ties. some banks advised employees to wear casual clothing or even stay home, but some refused to succumb to the pressure. despite attempts to blend in, bankers were still easily identifiable, often seen reading the financial times or dressing in a business casual look. protests remained tense, with thousands of anti-capitalist demonstrators converging on the city and clashes resulting in smashed windows and arrests. police remained on high alert in large numbers.
1991	manchester united executive vice-chairman ed woodward emphasized the influence of social media on players' popularity, using the example of daley blind's 73% increase in twitter followers (173,000 new followers) since joining the club. however, this argument may be questionable as cesc fabregas (900,000 new followers at chelsea) and mario balotelli (462,000 new followers at liverpool) have attracted more followers. the most significant percentage increase was seen by calum chambers, who joined arsenal, with a 203% rise (142,000 new followers). other notable mentions include ayoze perez (197% increase and 28,000 new followers at newcastle) and andrew robertson (123% increase and over 12,000 new followers at hull). woodward may argue that percentage increases are a better measure, but it remains unclear if players join clubs based on social media popularity or if they gain followers as a result. some summer signings, such as james mcarthur at crystal palace (2,900 new followers) and marc albrighton at leicester (1,500 new followers), have not experienced significant growth. ultimately, the impact of social media numbers on premier league points remains uncertain.
1992	spicejet cabin crew members were filmed dancing in the aisles during a holi celebration on a goa-bangalore flight, with two pilots taking photographs. the directorate general of civil aviation (dgca) has issued a show-cause notice to the airline, claiming that the mid-air entertainment endangered aircraft safety and created an "unruly environment." the dgca is threatening to suspend spicejet's license, citing possible effects on the aircraft's center of gravity and potential distraction of crew members. the airline has 15 days to respond to the notice.

1994	the secret service, once considered the gold standard in law enforcement, has come under criticism for security lapses and budget constraints. the agency's responsibilities have expanded significantly since 9/11, including protecting more people and new tasks like tracking online threats and monitoring large crowds. the secret service had 1,420 uniform division officers needed to protect the white house, but only currently has 1,320. agents are often asked to work overtime and training sessions have been canceled due to a shortage of funds. the secret service was rolled into the department of homeland security after 9/11, leading to competition for resources with larger agencies in the department. despite calls for more resources, some argue that the secret service has never lacked for funds and must learn to cut unnecessary expenses. recent high-profile security breaches at the white house, including the entrance of an intruder with a knife, have led to resignations within the agency. a report from homeland security criticized the agency for poor budget management, as officials were unable to provide a figure for the cost of protecting the white house.
1995	in the aftermath of the devastating ef5 tornado that struck moore, oklahoma, on may 20, 2013, leaving at least 24 people dead and over 237 injured, a heartwarming moment of reunification emerged between neighbor jim routon and his seven-year-old friend hezekiah darbon. both were at briarwood elementary school where the tornado had destroyed the building, reducing it to rubble. routon, filled with terror and desperation, discovered that hezekiah, whom he affectionately called "little dog," had survived. in a spontaneous display of relief and joy, routon hugged hezekiah tightly, with the young boy expressing his happiness and relief in return. the pair, who shared a close bond playing basketball and football, and referred to each other as "big dog" and "little dog," were overjoyed to be reunited amidst the chaos and destruction surrounding them. hezekiah's parents, who were working at the time, were unable to be present during the rescue efforts. the tornado obliterated much of moore and left many families searching for their loved ones, using the hashtag #okmissing. emergency workers saved more than 100 survivors from the wreckage, treating injuries ranging from minor to major, including degloving injuries. the tornado, which travelled through the oklahoma city suburb for 17 miles, was confirmed to be an ef5, the highest category on the tornado scale. the incident served as a beacon of hope amidst the devastation and tragedy endured by the community.
1996	olivia prokopova, an 18-year-old czech minigolf player and double masters champion, dreams of making the final putt on the iconic 18th hole of the masters tournament at augusta national golf club, but this is not the masters in georgia. instead, she is standing over a putt on the final hole of myrtle beach's hawaiian rumble mini golf course, where she has won the masters tournament for the last two years. born into a golfing family, prokopova began playing minigolf as a young child and has since become a dedicated member of the global minigolf community. the game, also known as crazy golf, originated in scotland in 1867 as an alternative for women who wanted to play golf but were discouraged by the violent swinging required in the full-size version. minigolf has evolved over the years and now boasts more than 38,000 registered players competing in over 1,300 annual tournaments. bob detwiler, founder of the us pro minigolf federation and owner of the hawaiian rumble course, began hosting minigolf tournaments in the late 1990s. the masters, held annually at detwiler's course, has become a magnet for dedicated minigolf athletes from around the world. the last two masters winners, prokopova, have taken home a total prize fund of just $12,000, a far cry from the $1.44 million earned by major champion adam scott. prokopova's commitment to the sport is unwavering. with her parents, coach, and even a masseuse in tow, she travels 4,500 miles to compete in us masters tournaments. the minigolf community, largely comprised of middle-aged men, is supportive but at times finds it difficult to accept defeat at the hands of a young woman. prokopova's success has p

2006	the population in britain rose by 419,900 in the year to mid-2012, the highest increase in europe, according to official estimates. this was driven by a higher birth rate and immigration. london and the south saw the biggest population increases. the population of the uk has grown by 6.1 million since 1992, with around 4 in 10 of the additional people being immigrants. six out of ten were due to rising birth rates, which brought a record 254,400 births. immigration, particularly from eastern europe, has been a major factor in the population increase. the population of the uk is currently 63.7 million and is expected to surpass 70 million in the early 2020s. the figures come despite efforts by the government to reduce net immigration to 1990s levels. the population increase was higher than in other eu countries such as france, germany, belgium, sweden, and holland. london accounted for a quarter of the population increase and saw the greatest rise, despite 51,000 people leaving the capital. the growing population is putting pressure on public services and infrastructure, with some commentators warning of the impact on housing, transport, and the nhs. ukip leader nigel farage criticized the government's failure to address immigration issues. paul vickers of the office for national statistics stated that 'together, london, the south east and east of england accounted for over half the growth.' the population pyramid shows a large number of 'baby boomers' and a low birth rate a decade ago. international net migration was 69,000. population matters, a pressure group, urged the government to promote smaller families as a way to address population growth and its consequences.
2007	police in omaha, nebraska, are investigating if two cases of double homicide, which occurred six miles apart and five years apart, might be linked. both sets of victims had ties to the pathology department at creighton university medical school. on tuesday, roger and mary brumback, both 65, were found dead in their home. roger was a professor in the pathology and neurology departments and was set to retire and move to west virginia. when a piano mover arrived, he discovered an ammunition clip in the doorway and mary's body inside, with roger found nearby. in 2008, 11-year-old thomas hunter and his family's housekeeper, shirlee sherman, were found dead in their home. thomas's father, william hunter, is still a faculty member in creighton's 12-person pathology department. he has expressed concern that the same person may be responsible. the cold-case unit is assisting in the investigation. the brumbacks were described as popular and dedicated colleagues, while the hunters' neighbors and colleagues said they were kind and family-oriented individuals. a prayer service was held at the school for the brumbacks, and tributes were paid by students.
2008	senate majority leader harry reid plans a vote on tuesday to renew unemployment benefits for approximately 1.3 million americans who lost them when the program expired at the end of december. democrats, including president barack obama, support extending the benefits, while republicans generally oppose them. the issue may be contentious as democrats control the senate and republicans have a majority in the house. roughly 1.3 million long-term unemployed individuals relied on this federal program, and without it, they will find the check missing in their mailboxes on monday. this is a repeating theme in congressional debates, with arguments made for and against the program's necessity to sustain economic recovery and provide financial support to struggling individuals, versus arguments that it is an economic drain and disincentive to work. the legislative battles take place against the backdrop of a midterm election year, and the white house has shown firm support for extending the benefits, setting the stage for potential future conflicts on funding the federal government, raising the debt ceiling, and addressing other contentious issues.

2031	the mayor of nanjing, ji jianye, was recently arrested on suspicions of accepting bribes worth approximately $3.3 million since taking office in march. this arrest is part of chinese president xi jinping's high-profile anti-corruption campaign, known as "catching tigers and flies," which targets both high-ranking and low-level corrupt officials. corruption is a deeply ingrained problem in chinese society, where the concept of "guanxi" or connections play a significant role in personal and business dealings. as a result, many view xi's campaign as an uphill battle. guanxi is a network of connections, and its importance is exemplified by the story of the narrator, who was unable to get promotions or secure hospital beds without it. businesspeople are required to spend a significant portion of their operating costs on guanxi to ensure survival and advancement, resulting in a corrupt system where officials and business elites have patron-client relationships. the problem of corruption in china has its roots in china's long tradition of rule by men rather than the rule of law and extends to the political sphere, with the country's leaders mostly being "princelings" or children of senior leaders. to effectively combat corruption, genuine political reforms, such as checks and balances, transparency, and independent scrutiny, need to be introduced alongside the observance of the rule of law. however, these remedies may be challenging for xi to implement. while xi's campaign has resulted in the arrest of several high-ranking officials, it is unlikely to eliminate the rampant corruption in every corner of society. the arrested nanjing mayor is reportedly under investigation for ties with suzhou's richest businessman, zhu xingliang, and other top leaders.

2047	in mogadishu, somalia, at least 39 civilians were killed and one soldier was injured when a roadside bomb targeted a convoy of african union (au) peacekeepers, prompting the troops to open fire. deputies and eyewitnesses condemned the attack, with the deputy mayor accusing the peacekeepers of deliberately killing civilians, an allegation au denied. the incident occurred on maka al-mukarama road in southern mogadishu, as somalia's newly elected president, sheikh sharif sheikh ahmed, attended an au summit in addis ababa. the u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon urged continued international support for somalia's reconciliation efforts at the summit, while the u.n. pledged to provide logistical support to the au's amisom force and help develop somali security forces. amisom was established to take over from ethiopian forces, who invaded somalia in 2006 to depose an islamic government led by ahmed, but the country has been without an effective central government since 1991 and has seen ongoing conflict with islamist groups like al-shabaab. ahmed was elected president on saturday, and many somalis view him as a final hope to challenge the militia and its extremist ideology.
2048	dr. shakil afridi, a pakistani doctor who helped the cia locate osama bin laden, was offered an opportunity to leave pakistan with his family after the may 2011 raid, but he declined the offer. afridi, who ran a fake vaccination campaign to gather dna samples from bin laden's children, was later jailed for 33 years on treason charges. u.s. officials believe that pakistan had ample time to help afridi leave the country if he had wanted to do so. the doctor's imprisonment has strained u.s-pakistan relations, with some u.s. senators cutting aid to pakistan as a result. president obama and his administration are making efforts to secure afridi's release. however, pakistani officials have given conflicting explanations for afridi's imprisonment, most recently stating that he was jailed for aiding militants and not for his links to the cia. afridi's family has described the treason charges as baseless and has received no help from the u.s. government. the u.s. sees afridi as a hero who helped bring an end to bin laden's reign of terror, while many pakistanis view him as a traitor who conspired against the state. pakistan has rejected u.s. criticism of afridi's imprisonment.

2050	capital one is under scrutiny for wanting to know debtors' addresses to potentially visit them if they owe money. the fair debt collection practices act (fdcpa) generally prohibits debt collectors from intrusive collection activities, but it does not apply to original creditors like capital one. the article raises concerns about modern contract law and consumers unwittingly agreeing to terms such as "personal visits" when signing up for credit cards or making online purchases. the article questions whether contract law should intervene to prevent corporations from imposing one-sided terms on consumers, while also considering the implications of citizens not being able to take responsibility for the contracts they enter into. the article also mentions capital one's statement denying the practice of sending debt collectors to homes and their consideration of creating separate agreements for cardholders due to a misplaced provision in their contracts. the article suggests that all the misunderstandings appear to benefit capital one.
2051	the jewish museum in berlin has launched an exhibit featuring a jewish man or woman seated inside a glass box for two hours a day to answer visitors' questions about jews and jewish life. the exhibit aims to educate postwar generations who may not know any jews or much about them, but has drawn criticism from some within the jewish community for putting a jew on display. critics argue the exhibition is degrading and may perpetuate harmful stereotypes. museum officials believe the provocative approach is necessary to overcome emotional barriers and deal with a painful topic for both jews and non-jews. the exhibit includes questioning displays that have raised controversy, such as a placard asking 'how you can recognize a jew?' the exhibition, which runs until september, has proven popular among visitors but has also sparked debate and criticism within the jewish community.
2052	a connecticut woman, mariantonia morales, was arrested and her pet marmoset monkey, aladdin, was confiscated after the monkey accidentally scratched morales' 10-year-old daughter on the face. morales, who brought the monkey from her home in south carolina to help her recover from cancer, was charged with risk of injury to a minor and owns an exotic pet, as it is illegal to keep a marmoset monkey like aladdin as a pet in connecticut. the girl was playing with the monkey when the injury occurred. although morales maintains that it was an accident, authorities insist that she is required to abide by connecticut's monkey laws, which were instated in response to a 2009 chimpanzee attack that left a woman with horrific injuries. mariantonia hopes the charges against her will be dropped and her beloved monkey will be returned to her, but it seems unlikely as the monkey has been taken to a zoo in bridgeport.

2058	a study published by the university of edinburgh reveals that large city hospitals act as breeding grounds for the superbug mrsa before it spreads to smaller regional hospitals. researchers found genetic evidence that variants of mrsa in smaller hospitals likely originated from larger cities. the study involved analyzing the genetic makeup of around 80 mrsa variants and traced their spread around the uk. the findings suggest that the referral of patients to different hospitals is a major cause of mrsa transmission and could help prevent the spread of infections. mrsa, a bacteria resistant to antibiotics, has been present for over 50 years and became increasingly common in the 1990s, reaching a peak of 7,700 cases in 2003-2004. a hand-washing campaign launched in 2004 resulted in a significant decrease in mrsa cases to 1,481 in 2010-2011.

2060	career criminal noel 'razor' smith, who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison, believes the current prison system in the uk is failing. with high re-offending rates, increasing violence and suicides, and a steady rise in prison populations, many argue that the prisons are in crisis. smith, who started a life of crime at a young age, has experienced the prison system firsthand, spending time in 34 different prisons, including notorious ones like whitemoor and belmarsh. he emphasizes that the prison population should only be for the most dangerous individuals and proposes that those with issues like alcohol or drug addiction or homelessness should be dealt with outside of prisons. he believes the answer is providing proper vocational and educational training, reducing the re-offending rate, which is currently at 46%. smith also criticizes the harsh prison conditions of the past, believing they do not work to prevent re-offending and encourages focusing on therapy and victim empathy, as he found at hmp grendon, which has the lowest re-offending rate in the uk. however, smith takes a controversial stance on drugs in prisons and is skeptical about mandatory drug testing, as it may result in more prisoners taking heroin instead of cannabis. he also criticizes ched evans' efforts to return to football despite being a convicted rapist. in recent years, the prison population has more than doubled, causing overcrowding and budget constraints, making it increasingly difficult for the national offender management service to provide effective rehabilitation programs. smith advocates for a system that focuses on rehabilitation, proper education, and providing resources for those leaving prison to prevent them from returning.

2065	thailand's february 2 general election has been declared invalid by a court due to disruptions caused by anti-government protesters in around a fifth of constituencies. the election, which was aimed at forming a new government after months of protests against prime minister yingluck shinawatra, was prevented from being held in 28 constituencies. the crisis, which has been ongoing for eight years, pits bangkok's royalist establishment and middle class against supporters of the shinawatra family, with protesters shutting down government offices and blocking major thoroughfares to force out yingluck. the violence and political paralysis have resulted in 23 deaths and hundreds of injuries, and have dented economic confidence, leading to cuts to growth forecasts. yingluck, who had called the election in december to try to defuse the protests, currently heads a caretaker government with limited powers. the main opposition democrat party, which had demanded electoral changes to reduce the influence of thaksin shinawatra, yingluck's brother and a former prime minister who was ousted in 2006 and lives in exile to avoid a jail term for corruption, threw in its lot with the protesters. the judges voted 6-3 to declare the february vote unconstitutional, but it is unclear when a new election will be held.

2074	fbi files reveal that the us law enforcement agency monitored and scrutinized dozens of african-american writers, including lorraine hansberry, langston hughes, james baldwin, and claude mckay, among others. the authors were subjected to extensive surveillance, with file sizes ranging from hundreds to thousands of pages. the fbi was particularly interested in their potential political views, especially those associated with socialism and communism, during the mccarthy era. black writers were aware of this surveillance, which influenced their works, such as richard wright's "fb eyes." the files shed light on the fbi's deep-seated hatred of the civil rights movement and dr. martin luther king jr. the average length of the files was around 300 pages, and some, such as hansberry's, were more than 1,000 pages long. the files contained detailed information about the writers' travels and contacts. while the surveillance was disabling for some authors, it also inspired creative experiments. prof. william maxwell, who discovered many of these files while researching claude mckay, wrote a book, "fb eyes," detailing this history of fbi surveillance of african-american writers from 1919 to 1972.
2075	a convoy of 280 white-painted trucks carrying relief goods or potential military supplies from russia towards the ukrainian border has raised concerns of a russian invasion in eastern ukraine. ukraine's deputy foreign minister, danylo lubkivsky, accused russia of using humanitarian aid as a pretext and inventing new excuses for their policies. the international committee of the red cross (icrc) denied any agreement with russia on such a convoy and expressed uncertainty about its role and the modalities of the aid handover. skepticism towards russian president vladimir putin's motives was rampant in kiev, with many fearing a possible escalation of the ongoing conflict, which has left over 2,000 people dead and nearly 5,000 wounded since mid-april. ukraine has vowed to stop any uncertified aid convoy from russia and received support from the us and nato in their opposition to such intervention. the fight for control of donetsk, the largest city in the eastern region of donbas, has intensified, with ukrainian forces pressing to recapture the city by ukraine's independence day on august 24.
2076	a new study by scientists at kobe university warns that japan could be wiped out by a massive volcanic eruption in the next century, potentially killing 95% of its population. the researchers analyzed the eruption patterns of volcanoes on the island nation and stated that it is not an exaggeration to predict extinction. they identified a massive volcanic crater on kyushu island as a particular concern and predicted an eruption could bury 7 million people under lava flows and create an uninhabitable toxic cloud on honshu, affecting the remaining 120 million people. the risk of such an event occurring in the next 100 years is estimated to be around 1%, but the researchers warn against ignoring the risk given the surprise 7.2-magnitude quake that struck kobe in 1995, which had a similar chance of occurrence. this warning comes after mount ontake erupted in september 2014 and killed 51 people, and signs of increased activity have been observed at a volcano in southern japan that poses a risk to a nuclear plant and at ioyama volcano in the southwestern part of kyushu.
2077	a planned three-day strike by london underground workers over tube ticket office closures was called off after last-minute talks between the rail, maritime and transport union (rmt) and london underground (lu). the industrial action was suspended due to substantial progress made in negotiations, with real movement on the core issues of job cuts, service reductions, and safety concerns. london mayor boris johnson described it as a victory for common sense and londoners. the dispute revolves around lu's intention to close 260 ticket offices and save £50 million per year for network improvements. the parties will now continue talks regarding the fundamental issues and the rmt's commitment to work with lu and the three other unions involved. londoners and businesses can now operate without the threat of unnecessary industrial action. the government will also announce its support for mayor johnson's proposals on ballot thresholds to limit union power to disrupt the capital.
2078	archaeologists in salekhard, siberia, discovered an ancient bronze ring dating back 2,000 years with images of a bear's head and paws. the ring, which was too small to fit on a woman's finger, was likely attached to the claw of a slain brown bear as a sign of respect in a bear cult. the ring, along with other precious objects like a carved figure, a pendant of an animal biting a bird, and a bronze bird with a mask, were found at an ancient spiritual site called ust-poluo. archaeologists believe that bear festivals were held to honor the memory of the slain bears, who were considered sacred ancestors by the ancient khanty tribes. the site was first excavated in the 1930s but was halted due to stalin's arrest of the chief archaeologist, vasily andrianov, on false charges. new discoveries in the area include other bronze objects, such as a bird with a mask and a pendant of a fur animal biting a bird, all believed to date to around the late bc or first ad.

2121	experts recommend incorporating sudoku and crosswords into schools to enhance children's brain power, boost memory, improve verbal fluency, and expand vocabulary. the university of cambridge conducted an extensive review, "puzzles in education," which found that while 75% of teachers use puzzles in their lessons, they are primarily viewed as engagement tools rather than academic benefits. puzzles, such as sudoku and word games, were discovered to support abstract reasoning, memorizing data, and terminology and vocabulary learning. sudoku is particularly effective in teaching math and science concepts through adaptation, such as using chemical symbols instead of numbers. with increasing tablet use among toddlers, internet safety education is necessary in pre-schools. word searches are recommended for learning specific topics, and crosswords aid verbal fluency, memory, and problem-solving skills. overall, puzzles align with the national curriculum. kath donovan, director of primary at pearson, emphasized the importance and underutilization of puzzles in education.
2122	researchers led by psychologist oriana aragon at yale university suggest that crying during happy experiences, such as weddings or reunions, is not an incorrect response but rather a way to restore emotional equilibrium. this response helps individuals manage intense positive emotions and recover more quickly. the study presents various examples of this phenomenon and suggests that there may be benefits to expressing negative emotions in response to positive experiences. these findings offer new insights into how people express and control their emotions and could contribute to a better understanding of mental health, relationships, and teamwork.

2126	a study conducted by ofcom, the communications watchdog, found that children as young as six have a better understanding of modern technology than most 45-year-olds. the millennium generation, born between 2000 and 2001, is shaping the future of media and digital communications due to their early exposure to technology. young adults spend over three and a half hours on their smartphones every day, compared to the national average. primary school children are more confident in using the latest devices than their parents. older generations are still learning to use email, while teenagers prefer impersonal forms of communication. ofcom also found that nearly half of adults check their work emails out of office hours due to the spread of smartphones and broadband internet. while children and teenagers are the most digitally savvy, all age groups are benefiting from new technology. however, some people believe the younger generation's reliance on technology may signal the demise of traditional phone calls and other forms of personal communication.
2127	a new study funded by the medical research council (mrc) in the uk found that while more premature babies born at 24, 25, and 26 weeks are surviving, the chances of survival for babies born before 24 weeks remain rare. the study compared babies born between 22-26 weeks in 2006 with those born between 22-25 weeks in 1995. over the 11-year period, the overall survival rate increased by 13%, from 40 to 53%, but there was no significant improvement in the survival of babies born before 24 weeks. the study also found that the number of babies born between 22 and 25 weeks and admitted to intensive care units increased by 44%. the vast majority of babies born before 27 weeks still face significant health issues and many go on to live with long-term health problems such as cerebral palsy, learning difficulties, and lung conditions. the authors of the study emphasized that ethical guidelines in the uk do not suggest providing active care for babies born at 22 weeks six days and earlier, as the survival rate is small to nonexistent. the study also noted that as the number of premature births rises, so will the demand for healthcare, education, and social services to support survivors with disabilities. uk government officials have called for a reduction in the current legal limit for abortion, which is at 24 weeks, citing medical advances as justification. however, the authors of the study argue that the focus should be on preventing premature birth in the first place.

2132	scientists have identified a protein called periostin, which plays a major role in tumor spread and could lead to new cancer treatments. they found that without this protein, cancer stem cells cannot initiate metastasis and instead disappear or remain dormant. periostin naturally exists in the extracellular matrix and has been shown to play a role in fetal development. in adults, it is only active in specific parts of the body such as the mammary glands, bones, skin, and intestine. the scientists showed that mice bred to lack periostin avoided metastatic cancer and developed an antibody that attaches to the protein, rendering it dysfunctional. while the treatment had few side effects in mice, there is caution about applying the same method to humans as it is not clear if an equivalent antibody will work in humans or whether the side effects will be the same. most cancer deaths are caused by metastatic spread to vital organs such as the liver or brain.
2133	the bank of england is expected to raise interest rates and introduce a cap on mortgage lending in the coming months due to rising concerns about the housing market. the new powers will allow the bank to limit the proportion of high loan-to-income mortgages each bank can lend or even ban all new lending above a specific loan-to-income ratio. the cap is believed to be around three to three-and-a-half times the borrower's salary. chancellor george osborne insists there is no immediate threat to financial stability from the housing market but acknowledged potential concerns for the future. banks have been criticized for offering mortgages worth up to five times borrowers' salaries, which would make homes unaffordable for many if a similar cap were implemented. the government aims to build 200,000 homes per year and force councils to pre-approve planning permissions on brownfield sites, while senior bank executives are discussing potential action to control the housing market. options under consideration include requiring larger deposits, restricting high loans, and longer-term mortgages. business secretary vince cable expressed concern over high mortgage offers and advocated for a more stable level of three to three-and-a-half times borrowers' salaries. approximately 3.4 million mortgage holders, or around 38% of the total, have mortgages worth more than three times their net household income.

2143	hundreds of militants attacked a joint american-afghan outpost in eastern afghanistan on saturday, resulting in the deaths of at least eight american troops and two afghan national security force members. this is the largest number of american fatalities from hostile action in over a year, according to cnn records. the militants used rockets, mortars, and heavy-caliber machine guns, and firing positions in the mountains made it difficult for u.s. troops to fight back effectively due to the terrain and weather conditions. both american and afghan forces repelled the attack and inflicted "heavy enemy casualties." preliminary reports suggest that at least 13 afghan police officers were captured, and portions of the outpost burned down. the military is investigating the incident and withholding the identities of the deceased until their families are notified. the u.s. military had planned to leave the post prior to the attack, and the focus is now on protecting afghan civilians rather than holding remote outposts. the last time american troops suffered similar casualties was in the wanat attack in 2008, but the pentagon is still investigating the causes of that incident, including the failure of intelligence.
2144	a tourism chief in torquay, england, expressed her disappointment andconcern over the return of mark jenkins, the real-life inspiration for the basil fawlty character in the classic comedy series "the hotel," for a fourth series this summer. the show, which previously depicted jenkins' eccentric leadership of the grosvenor hotel, has been criticized for portraying torquay's hotel standards in an unbalanced way. jenkins will now star as an entertainments manager at the cavendish hotel, and while the owners are keeping quiet about the deal, they believe it will bring good publicity to the area. however, carolyn custerson, the chairman of visitdevon, has expressed her opposition to the negative portrayal of torquay's hotels and believes that all publicity is not good publicity. john cleese, the co-writer of "fawlty towers," based the character of basil fawlty on donald sinclair, a former owner of the gleneagles hotel in torquay, who was known for his rude behavior.

("victory!") along the left bank boulevards, while nicolas sarkozy's planned celebration at the concorde was cancelled. with 51.7% of the votes, hollande secured a narrow yet historic victory over sarkozy. in his first few hours as president, hollande took a more low-key approach than his predecessor, delivering a calming and conciliatory speech from corrèze and speaking to the crowds at the bastille late into the night. hollande's election was not so much a response to his policies, but rather his perceived personality. despite france's financial troubles, many voters preferred his more laid-back demeanor to sarkozy's aggressive attitude. in the coming days, hollande will face numerous challenges, including reassuring the markets, pushing for economic growth, and addressing the upcoming g8 and nato summits. he will also need to secure a strong majority at the national assembly in order to effectively implement his policies. despite the hurdles ahead, hollande has expressed intentions to spearhead a new anti-austerity movement in europe and has made a few symbolic gestures, such as lowering the retirement age for some workers and raising students' scholarships, to signify a departure from sarkozysm. these actions are likely to be popular with the french public. the success of hollande's presidency, particularly in relation to germany and europe, remains to be seen.

2202	fitness experts and scientists have identified walking as the newest "superfood" in fitness, emphasizing its importance over intense exercise. biomechanist katy bowman, author of "move your dna: restore your health through natural movement," believes that walking is necessary to meet the body's movement requirements, just like dietary nutrients. preliminary research suggests that a combination of physical activity and inactivity could be more critical for chronic disease risk than just physical activity alone. experts advise that sitting around for long durations cannot be offset by one hour of exercise. leslie sansone, creator of the "walk at home: mix & match walk blasters" dvd, encourages people to embrace the ease of walking instead of pursuing lengthy gym sessions for fitness. a small study published in the journal of medicine & science in sports and exercise indicates that taking short walks throughout prolonged sitting may reverse the negative effects of prolonged sitting on leg arteries. dr. carol ewing garber, president of the american college of sports medicine (acsm), suggests that walking 7,500 steps per day, which is less than the current acsm guidelines of 10,000 steps, may be more realistic. garber, a professor of movement sciences at columbia university in new york, acknowledges that walking has its limitations for bone health and strength, but maintains that it still holds numerous benefits and should be a priority when choosing one form of exercise.
2203	an 11-year-old girl named abigail baker from desborough, northamptonshire, created a dress made from 25,000 loom bands and sold it on ebay for £155. she spent seven days making the multi-colored garment and made a £65 profit. however, two women from wales previously sold an almost identical dress for £170,000, but the buyer backed out. abigail's parents are proud of her dedication and creativity. she made the dress to raise money for a family holiday and donate to her old brownie pack. experts warn that loom bands, which are made of plastic elastic, could be harmful to marine life and seabirds if they end up in the ocean. the national marine aquarium in plymouth, devon, urges children to leave loom bands at home when they go to the beach and to dispose of them carefully to minimize the risk to wildlife.
2204	a new study by victoria university revealed that 80% of secondary school students in australia experienced distressing homophobic comments, mostly in physical education classes. these casual comments, such as "you're so gay," were causing mental health problems, particularly among students identifying as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and gender diverse, who reported severe levels of depression nearly double that of their straight counterparts. the study found that 25% of these students also experienced physical abuse and pushing during pe lessons. the research highlighted pe as a particularly problematic environment due to the traditional gender roles and masculinity reinforced in sports. beyondblue, a mental health organization, has called for action to prevent homophobic abuse in schools, including standing against derogatory language and creating inclusive and safe environments. there are existing awareness initiatives in place, but there is a need for greater education and support for teachers to tackle such abuse.

2212	a meteor that exploded over southwestern russia in february, the largest to hit earth since the 1908 tunguska incident, was hard to detect due to its darkened surface caused by previous collisions that melted metallic elements and formed fissures, according to a finnish researcher. the meteor, about 60 feet long, exploded with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs and resulted in over 1,500 injuries. dark asteroids, which reflect 5% or less of sunlight, are harder to detect than regular asteroids. nasa estimates there are approximately 4,700 "potentially hazardous" asteroids, and the chelyabinsk meteor incident raised concerns about humanity's vulnerability to such objects. nasa aims to send a spacecraft to seize and tow an asteroid into orbit around the moon for study, a project also considered a planetary defense mission, but it faced opposition in congress and funding was blocked.

2243	the video game industry is experiencing a shift in revenue sources, with traditional disc-based games on consoles and pcs expected to decline to $4 (£2) out of every $10 (£6) spent in 2014. online games and mobile gaming are on the rise, accounting for 31% and 28% of revenue, respectively. this trend is due to increased popularity of digital downloads and mobile gaming, which offers cheaper and more accessible options for gamers. console sales, specifically for sony and microsoft, have been strong but weak for nintendo, contributing to an overall decline in sales for the 8th generation of consoles. while spending on disc-based games is anticipated to peak again in 2016, further growth depends on the success of value-oriented plays from android micro-consoles. although some predict the decline of console gaming, analysts believe there will always be a market for dedicated console gamers and that innovation in gaming technology, such as oculus rift vr and android micro-consoles, presents an exciting future for the industry.

2248	india, the second-largest producer of cotton and the biggest consumer by china, has imposed a ban on cotton exports, but is now considering lifting the ban due to pressure from farmers and potential cabinet members. india instituted the ban to ensure cotton supplies for domestic textile companies, but the move has led to protests from cotton-producing farmers and concerns from global trading partners, particularly china. the ban has added volatility to the cotton market, which has already experienced sharp price swings in the past two years due to export restrictions and mill defaults. the outcome of the cabinet review is expected to be announced today, and there is a "realistic, high chance" that the ban will be lifted. china, which has bought large amounts of foreign cotton for its government reserve, has lodged a formal protest against india's ban. indian farmers have suffered from lower prices due to higher production this year and need to export to recover losses, while domestic textile companies have struggled to compete with rivals in bangladesh and pakistan due to rising cotton prices in india. the trade regulator's move to lift the ban is expected to push down cotton prices in the country. cotton prices have risen this year due to the ban and peaked at an all-time high of over $2 a pound last year. the article was published by the financial times on march 12, 2012.

2267	a study led by dr. sung doo kim from the university of cincinnati found that taking short online breaks during work hours can boost productivity, especially for employees with active jobs. however, if taken in an undisciplined manner, these breaks could lead to cyberloafing and the excessive loss of time and productivity. the study discovered that triggers for online work breaks include a high need for recovery, monotony or boredom, checking on demands at home, and emotional work-related events. the rejuvenating effects of online breaks were more pronounced for jobs that required a good deal of physical activity or a lot of face-to-face interaction, rather than jobs that involved extensive computer time or sitting at a desk for prolonged periods. older workers and those with strict workplace policies against personal use of workplace computers were less likely to take advantage of online breaks. the research suggests that momentary recovery, learning, and satisfaction are the three consequences of these breaks. the study also found that workers reported benefits from going online to balance work and personal responsibilities, such as checking on their children. however, using phones and tablets to access work email outside office hours can significantly increase stress levels.
2268	yasmin nakhuda, the self-proclaimed mother ofmonkey darwin, a japanese snow macaque who gained global attention after escaping from her car in an ikea parking lot and being photographed wearing a shearling jacket, has given up her legal battle to regain ownership of the monkey from story brook farm primate sanctuary. nakhuda received death threats and faced ridicule during the heated custody dispute, which cost her significant legal fees and left her little chance of success. a court ruled in september 2013 that darvin is a wild animal, and once he escaped, nakhuda lost ownership. the sanctuary incurred expenses due to the lawsuit and was able to pay them off with the costs award, while the remainder was split with kevin d. toyne, who worked on the case pro bono. darvin, who was raised in a human home, is slowly learning to be more monkey-like and has groomed one of his neighbors and learned to imitate other monkey's vocalizations. nakhuda will keep the monkey darvin facebook page and expressed "no regrets" about her efforts to regain ownership.

2274	a new international debate over free speech has emerged following protests in muslim countries over an offensive youtube video about islam, which led to the deaths of over 50 people, including the us ambassador to libya. some arab and muslim leaders are advocating for new international rules limiting free expression to prevent religious insults. this has sparked a call to action for democracy advocates, with many fearing the impact on freedom of speech as a human right and cornerstone of democracy. during the un general assembly, president obama defended free speech, arguing that the strongest weapon against hateful speech is more speech. however, some criticize the us's response to the video as contradictory to its belief in free speech, with some leaders emphasizing the importance of respecting religious sensitivities. the issue comes at a crucial time for new democracies in the middle east, with obama calling for a push for more, not less free speech throughout the world. despite concerns over blasphemy laws in some countries, it is crucial to uphold the international right to free expression for all human beings. to combat offensive representations of their religion, muslims are encouraged to launch educational campaigns instead of resorting to violence or attempts to limit free speech. in the end, the bigots will only lose if free speech prevails.
2275	a tiny 1.5-inch long hermann's tortoise named tank, who is currently residing at paradise wildlife park in hertfordshire, has become a popular attraction due to his miniature size. despite being dwarfed by common household items like a spoon, lip balm, and a computer mouse, tank's energy and charm have captivated visitors. born at the park six months ago, tank will eventually grow to be about 11 inches long, but for now, he lives up to his fearsome name by perching on the head of a lion. hermann's tortoises originate from southern spain and france and typically grow between 6 to 8 inches until they reach full maturity at around six to eight years old.
2276	a father-of-three named jacek korolko was fined £1,300 by bristol city council for playing loud celine dion and eminem songs in his flat, despite his claims that he is the victim of wrongful blame from neighbors. korolko, who lives with his wife and three children, moved into the property 15 months ago and claims his neighbors have shunned him and wrongly accused him of various issues such as noise, dog mess, and litter. he has since become increasingly stressed and has thrown out his stereo, sold his dog, and made his teenage daughter listen to music using headphones. korolko admits to playing music loudly only three times, including on his wife and teenage daughter's birthdays. the problems started as soon as he moved in, with neighbors ignoring him and complaining about his children's noise. despite several warnings and a noise abatement notice, korolko was fined £500 for two breeches of the notice and ordered to pay costs and a victim surcharge. a spokeswoman for the council stated that after several warnings, they served a notice under section 80 of the environmental protection act 1990. korolko cannot afford to pay the charges and had to return to poland to deal with his father's funeral.

2278	the house of lords incurred a nearly £2 million loss in revenues from its restaurants last year, resulting in an increase in the controversial catering subsidy from £1.85m to £1.95m. the subsidy allows peers to enjoy discounted fine dining, with meals priced significantly lower than in central london. the peers' dining room alone required £886,996 of taxpayers' money. labour mp john mann condemned the house as a "lavish retirement home" and called for its size to be reduced. john o'connell of the taxpayers' alliance urged the halving of the net cost of catering and retail services by 2015/16. the issue is not exclusive to the house of lords, as mps also benefit from taxpayer-subsidized meals. the unpredictable nature of parliamentary sittings and the need to pay staff the london living wage contribute to the high costs. many are critical of the subsidies in the context of austerity britain. in response, a house of lords spokesperson stated that they had reduced the catering subsidy by 27 per cent since 2007 and aimed to halve the net cost by 2015/16. they added that the catering services were necessary for a working parliament and that they paid staff the london living wage. however, the criticism about taxpayer-subsidised meals in the house of commons has reached a boiling point, with demands to end the £7 million yearly subsidy for food and drink.
2279	a lockdown at indiana university-purdue university indianapolis (iupui) was lifted tuesday afternoon, according to the school's twitter account. the lockdown was imposed due to a report of an armed person on campus, and students and staff were instructed to take shelter until an all-clear message was received. the all-clear message came at 4:36 p.m., and the school resumed normal operations. the identity of the person reported to be armed remains unknown, and it is unclear whether a gunman was found. approximately 30,000 students attend the university in indianapolis.
2280	prabhjot singh, a sikh doctor and columbia university professor, was recently attacked by a group of teenagers who fractured his jaw and called him derogatory names. instead of seeking revenge, singh expressed a desire to engage with his attackers and invited them to visit a gurdwara, a sikh place of worship. this forgiving and constructive approach is rooted in sikh teachings and reflects the experiences of sikh advocacy work since 9/11. an incident involving gurpreet singh and thomas brand illustrates this approach in action. thomas, who was filled with anger and fear after 9/11, attacked gurpreet on a train and was arrested and prosecuted for hate crime. however, gurpreet requested that thomas be given community service instead of jail time to combat hate in a post-9/11 world. this alternative approach led to a healing experience for all parties involved and challenged the punitive bent of the criminal justice system.
2281	a study by axa ppp healthcare revealed that one in three brits leave appointments with their gp feeling baffled due to medical jargon. thirty-one percent of participants felt confused, anxious, and uneasy after failing to understand their doctor's explanations. one in ten young adults even believed harmless conditions were terminal. many misunderstood common medical terms, with 55% not knowing what a ganglion is, and 49% mistaking somnambulism for sleepwalking. over 11% were too embarrassed to ask questions, and 10% didn't want to waste their gp's time. health experts warned that this embarrassment factor can lead to misunderstandings and confusion. forty-one percent of respondents didn't understand the term hypertension, despite it being high blood pressure. younger generations were found to be less knowledgeable about medical terms, with 23% of 18-24-year-olds misunderstanding a fracture as a torn muscle and 17% thinking mri stood for multiple radiation investigations. five percent of young adults believed hypertension to be a hyperactive disorder, and 12% thought a diagnosis of sleepwalking was a type of ear infection. overall, good communication between doctors and patients is crucial for understanding medical diagnoses and conditions.
2282	karl rove, a close advisor to president bush for over a decade, announced his resignation from the white house on monday, august 27, 2007. rove's departure came after discussions began last summer and was described as a difficult decision. he plans to write a book and teach politics after leaving. rove's tenure was marked by successful domestic policies but also failure to engineer winning strategies on immigration and midterm elections. he had been subpoenaed to testify in several investigations, including the leak of cia operative valerie plame's identity. his departure came as bush faces low approval ratings, and republican presidential hopefuls work to differentiate themselves from his administration. rove intends to return to washington over the weekend before heading to texas for dove hunting and a beach vacation with family. his role as "the architect" of bush's winning campaigns will be difficult to replace.

2286	grozny, chechnya: a decade of transformation (cnn) - ten years have passed since the author's last visit to chechnya. what he found was astonishing. formerly known for its violence and lawlessness, chechnya was once a war-torn region with a devastated capital, grozny, left in ruins. the impoverished russian army had been locked in a brutal struggle with chechen insurgents, leading to widespread kidnappings for ransom, where body parts were often amputated on camera. today, russian government minders escort foreign journalists through the newly-constructed airport to a peaceful and bustling grozny. in place of the dark streets and gunmen, there are mosques, illuminated parks, and high-rises being built, all without a soldier or gunman in sight. chechnya's second-largest city, gudermes, used to be a place of open jokes about kidnapping and ransom. now, armies of workers, including migrant laborers from asia, are constructing roads and high-rises amidst singing residents. kadyrov, a former rebel fighter, is now the president of the chechen republic and has adopted the habits of a middle eastern despot. despite claims of victory and a purported small insurgent presence, there have been reports of extrajudicial killings and human rights abuses. the price for peace in chechnya remains troubling as instability continues to grow in the neighboring regions of dagestan and ingushetia.
2287	in a speech given in 1961, ronald reagan voiced his concern about medicare pushing the us towards socialism, warning that it could lead to the loss of individual freedom. this fear of federal power, which was also expressed by conservative figures like barry goldwater and newt gingrich, has deep roots in us history, with conservative movements warning against social programs since the new deal era. however, reagan and other conservative presidents ultimately did not fulfill their campaigns promises to reduce government programs, and americans have come to rely on them. conservative activism, fueled by wealthy donors, persists as a way for outsiders to maintain a sense of fervor and opposition to "big government," even if their ideology does not align with their actions once in power. despite the hyperbole and dire predictions, social programs like social security and medicare have not resulted in the loss of individual liberty. on the contrary, these programs have enabled millions of people to avoid poverty and hardship. despite their claims, conservative political figures have not succeeded in significantly reducing the size of the federal government or eliminating entitlement programs once in power. in fact, many republicans have expanded entitlement programs or initiated new ones, such as medicare part d under george w. bush. the american people's preference for government programs often clashes with the conservative "small government" rhetoric. although reagan made no effort to reduce social security benefits during his presidency, the latest incarnation of the grassroots right, the tea party, has achieved a victory of sorts by bringing the country to the brink of a financial crisis – a potential debacle that could prompt americans to reconsider the role and function of the government. ultimately, the struggle to preserve the american constitutional order against perceived enemies persists, with the future of social programs like medicare and medicaid still uncertain. the opinions expressed in this summarization are that of michael kazin.
2288	the author of this week's column expresses concern over beijing's air quality, which is rated "slightly polluted" by the chinese environmental monitoring center but "hazardous" by the u.s. embassy's air-quality monitoring app. the difference in measurements lies in the size of particulate matter being measured: pm10 vs. pm2.5. the chinese monitoring stations measure larger pollutants, while the u.s. embassy device detects tiny particles that cause smog and are considered more harmful. experts blame rapid urbanization and industrialization for the air pollution, with beijing having over 5 million cars and burning 27 million tons of coal in 2010. the costs of worsening air quality are significant, both in terms of individual health concerns and societal costs. china acknowledges the issue and has pledged to address it, with a five-year plan focusing on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and pollution reductions. a green movement is emerging, with "huanbao" (environmental protection) becoming a popular phrase. public interest in environmental monitoring has grown, with the beijing municipal environmental monitoring center now open to the public. some, including real estate tycoon pan shiyi, are pushing for more stringent pm2.5 standards, while china may adopt them gradually. encouraging signs include at least two cities in south china adopting pm2.5 on a trial basis. the author hopes for quicker actions to address the air quality concerns for the sake of current and future generations.
2289	gareth bale's childhood sweetheart emma rhys-jones's father, martin rhys-jones, is currently in a federal prison in the us accused of masterminding a global financial fraud scheme, also known as a "boiler room" scam. rhys-jones, a businessman who separated from his wife in cardiff and moved to barcelona, spain in 2005, is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, and could face up to 30 years in prison and a fine of £160,000 if convicted. the scam involved cold-calling people in the uk and canada to sell them worthless shares for high prices, with the sales team falsely claiming that share prices were of much higher value. rhys-jones hired six people to make the fraudulent calls and offered them free rent in barcelona and commission for sales. customers were eventually sent worthless share certificates. more than £3.2million was invested in the scheme before the money was transferred to bank accounts in new york, spain, the uk, and switzerland. rhys-jones used aliases "martin reece" and "john allen" while in barcelona and has not been able to meet his granddaughter, alba violet bale, since she was born last year due to his extradition to the us. bale and emma carried out a long-distance relationship for eight years and have been known to avoid public appearances together. commenting on the case, james spero, special agent in charge of homeland security investigations in buffalo, new york, said: "these criminals demonstrated a callous disregard for the hard-earned money of individuals who thought they were legitimately investing in their futures. they will now have to account for their actions before a court of law.” rhys-jones's mother, grace rhys-jones, has been told not to speak about the case.
2290	binyamin netanyahu's new coalition government is planning to change conscription laws, potentially drafting ultra-orthodox jews into the israeli military as part of efforts to reduce the country's benefits bill. former military chief moshe "bogie" ya'alon, expected to become israel's next defense minister, is leading the push for this controversial move which has sparked protests from the ultra-orthodox community. netanyahu's government is seen as having a better chance than previous administrations to carry out the reform due to the exclusion of the ultra-orthodox shas party and the inclusion of the centrist yesh atid, jewish home, and hatnua parties. ya'alon is also known for his hawkish stance on iran, which aligns with netanyahu's views. if agreed upon, the new rules would end the ultra-orthodox exemption from military service. netanyahu, who previously served as israeli prime minister between 1996 and 1999 and again between 2009 and 2013, could reach an agreement with coalition partners as early as tomorrow.
2291	dentists are urging for a 75% reduction in daily sugar consumption to prevent tooth decay, which affects around a third of uk children and costs between 6-10% of total health expenses. experts at university college london recommend limiting added sugar intake to four teaspoons a day, equivalent to less than half a can of coca-cola or just two digestives. the food industry will likely resist a sugar tax, which some propose to reduce consumption, especially in processed foods and drinks. a study published in the public health nutrition journal argues that only significant cuts in sugar use will effectively combat tooth decay. the paper, co-authored by professor aubrey sheiham and professor philip james, suggests a daily limit of 15g or four teaspoons of sugar. adults currently consume an average of 58g or 14.5 teaspoons of sugar a day, and the world health organization recommends a maximum of 5% of daily calories (25g or six teaspoons). the researchers advocate for very low sugar intakes throughout life to protect teeth, stating previous analyses focusing on children have been misleading. nutritionist katherine jenner supports the study's findings, emphasizing the unnecessary nature of added sugars and their links to dental decay, obesity, and type ii diabetes.
2292	former california governor arnold schwarzenegger's official portrait was hung at the state capitol on friday with a touch-up on the previously painted-over image of his wife, maria shriver. the smudge that once showed her face was smoothed out by austrian artist gottfried helnwein. the portrait, a realist-style painting with a steel frame, now hangs on the third floor of the capitol next to his predecessor, gray davis. the embarrassing revelations of schwarzenegger's affair with his maid and the resulting out-of-wedlock son led to the removal of shriver's image when the portrait was initially unveiled in september. there are concerns about people touching the portrait due to its photograph-like feel, and portraits are deliberately hung high on the wall to prevent damage. children on a capitol tour were the first to recognize the newly hung portrait, identifying it as arnold schwarzenegger's, despite his fame from his acting career.
2293	a 53-year-old cleaner was rescued after falling into a three-metre deep sinkhole while assisting an elderly woman with laundry in springvale, melbourne. the sinkhole, which appeared small at the surface, was revealed to be an old, poorly concealed well. the woman was initially submerged in water but managed to attract neighbors' attention after about 40 minutes. firefighters extracted her within 15 minutes of the call. the cleaner was not injured. engineers were investigating the cause of the sinkhole.
2294	the church of england will no longer resist gay marriage among its congregation, archbishop justin welby stated last night, as the law legalizes same-sex marriage starting tomorrow. divisive attempts by bishops to ban clergy from marrying same-sex partners provoked a backlash, but archbishop welby urges the church to demonstrate love for all human beings. seven clergy couples were planning to marry their partners in defiance, and some clergy intend to bless same-sex marriages. the anglican church is deeply divided on the issue, and welby aims to prevent the disagreement from spreading to the uk through "structured conversations" between opponents and supporters. conservative evangelical congregations threaten to leave the church of england if it compromises its opposition to gay sex by blessing civil partnerships. the reverend andrew cain from north london also plans to marry his partner.
2295	manchester united manager david moyes held talks with juventus's chief transfer negotiator, beppe marotta, about signing midfielders paul pogba and arturo vidal. moyes traveled to italy to watch juventus's game against cagliari and discussed the possibility of bringing either, or both, players to old trafford. however, pogba's departure from united 18 months ago was described as a mistake by zinedine zidane, and juventus is not willing to sell him. moyes also tried to off-load fringe players, but juventus is not interested in nani due to the asking price, and fabio could be headed to cardiff. galatasaray and monaco are interested in signing nemanja vidic on a free transfer in the summer.
2296	angel di maria revealed that cristiano ronaldo advised him to wear the number 7 shirt at manchester united due to its historical significance at the club. di maria, who signed a five-year contract worth £200,000-a-week, was handed the iconic jersey worn by club legends ronaldo, eric cantona, and david beckham. the argentine international expressed his desire to help man united return to the champions league and promised to give his best to win trophies for the club. louis van gaal welcomed di maria as the fourth summer signing, who cost the club £59.7 million plus add-ons. despite the club's early season struggles, with no wins in the premier league and the embarrassing 4-0 loss to league one side mk dons in the capital one cup, van gaal is optimistic about di maria's abilities to improve the squad and instill his playing style. the dutch manager believes di maria, who is versatile and can play in both attack and defense, will be a team player and provide good results for man united.
2297	the maldives government has confirmed a 15-year-old girl was sentenced to 100 lashes and eight months house arrest for engaging in premarital sex. the girl, a reported victim of sexual abuse by her stepfather, was ordered to remain in a children's home with the option to receive the punishment immediately or when she turns 18. the prosecutor's office is restricting information due to laws protecting minors, while amnesty international and human rights watch have called for the girl's charges to be dropped and for the law to be reformed. the maldives, consisting of 1,200 small islands, faces criticism of its legal system following the resignation of its first democratically elected president and criticism from the un special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. the psychological and physical impacts of the floggings, considered ceremonial by some, are debated, with faiz stating those sentenced are reluctant to speak about the experience due to shame and stigma.

2301	the national trust, a u.k. heritage organization, has expressed concerns over the proliferation of wind farms, which they deem the "most widespread and persistent threat" to the british countryside. national trust chairman sir simon jenkins has spoken out against the government's planning reforms, stating that they could lead to conflict in local communities if not delayed, as wind turbines are intrusive forms of renewable energy and can blight the landscape. the national trust, which opposes wind turbines in the wrong places, cannot afford to buy large areas of land to prevent wind farm construction due to the widespread number of applications. instead, they may consider purchasing easements to prevent wind farms in sensitive landscapes. the charity fears that planning reforms, which encourage development without local plans in place, will result in unwanted speculative development and costly legal battles. the deadline for councils to adopt local plans is fast approaching, and only half have done so. the national trust is urging the government to delay the introduction of the new rules to prevent further conflict over development in the countryside. sir simon has also raised concerns over other threats to the countryside, including the proposed hs2 high-speed rail line and shale gas exploration.
2302	a 23-year-old nurse in mumbai, india, who reported being raped and attempting to be killed by a man on a train, was overflowing with anger and hit the man during her police statement. she had accused the 27-year-old man of trying to rape her while she was traveling to work on the early morning train. he was arrested at the next station, but the nurse went to the police station to report the crime and confronted the man when he was brought in for questioning. while her actions are not condoned, the police reportedly understood her state of mind given the prevalence of violent assaults against women in india. the country has seen a rise in reported rapes and violent attacks against women, leading to increased calls for justice and stricter laws. recently, four men were sentenced to death for the infamous gang rape and murder of jyoti singh on a delhi bus in 2012. the government has taken steps to address the issue but rape remains a common occurrence in india. despite these efforts, many women still fear reporting crimes due to social stigma and police corruption. it is argued that deep-rooted patriarchal attitudes contribute to the persistence of gender-based violence in india.
2303	during the cold war, the united states employed the strategy of nuclear deterrence to prevent nuclear attacks against it by maintaining a strong nuclear force that could retaliate with devastating power against the soviet union. this theory proved successful as the soviet union never attacked the united states or any other nation to obtain nuclear weapons. however, the current administrations' approach towards north korea and iran seems different, with the united states considering military action against these countries, who are attempting to develop nuclear weapons. this shift in strategy may be due to perceived aggressive behavior and religious fanaticism of their leaders, despite the theory of deterrence suggesting that both north korea's kim jong un and iran's supreme leader would be deterred from using nuclear weapons to avoid the destruction of their nations and their people. the high costs and danger of the nuclear arms race during the cold war are also cause for reconsidering the use of nuclear weapons today. instead, diplomacy and peaceful negotiations should be prioritized to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, potentially leading to a world without nuclear weapons. with north korea, a less confrontational approach, perhaps coupled with deterrence, may bring about a peaceful resolution. with iran, efforts should be made to build trust and find a peaceful resolution through diplomacy, as threatening military action only reinforces iran's suspicions of america's true intentions.

2320	the man in the moon, a popular celestial feature seen from earth, has intrigued humans for centuries with various cultural interpretations. ancient chinese believed it was a goddess, early christians thought it was a banished man, and medieval englishmen considered it the god of drunkards. recent research suggests that the shapes forming the "face" of the man in the moon were not created by asteroid strikes or giant tension cracks, but by magma bubbling up to the moon's surface. the 1,800-mile-wide procellarum basin, which features the "face," was formed by large plumes of molten rock. the circles are likely made up of sharp angles produced by tension cracks in the moon's crust as it cooled, creating a "plumbing system" for magma to surface and fill smaller basins. the latest theory, published in the journal nature, was established through high-definition maps of the moon's surface using nasa data, revealing the angular shapes that cannot be explained by asteroid strikes. however, the mystery of how the magma plume was formed remains unsolved.

2343	hu jintao, the outgoing leader of china's communist party, is leaving a mixed legacy after a decade in power marked by rapid social and economic changes, but also political turmoil, disasters, and crackdowns. working with premier wen jiabao, hu has solidified china's position as a global power, but faced criticism for the uneven distribution of wealth and lack of progress in narrowing the wealth gap. hu, an engineer with experience in underdeveloped provinces, rose through the communist youth league and assumed the top party post in 2002, espousing policies of balanced, equitable, and sustainable development. under hu, china became the world's second-largest economy and made strides in military and space technology, but faced ethnic unrest and political opposition, which resulted in harsh crackdowns and repression of dissidents. hu advocated a "peaceful rise," but critics say china is far from harmonious, with conflicts and contradictions worsening. hu's attempt to amend the party's constitution to include his scientific development mantra was seen as a sign of power consolidation. however, hu failed to narrow the wealth gap and made little progress in curbing endemic corruption, leading to criticism of his leadership as weak and missed opportunities. the new leadership, with xi jinping expected to take over as general secretary, is facing fractious bargaining among the party elite and external demands for change, which may take time for xi to address.

2345	a 19-year-old woman named cheyanne willis from ohio was brutally attacked by a group of six women, including two she knew, at a suburban cincinnati mall on christmas eve. the women allegedly took turns kicking and beating willis, shaving her head, and brutalized her in front of her then-boyfriend, quincy gardner. the attackers posted photographs and videos of the assault on social media to humiliate her. willis suffered from black eyes, multiple concussions, and a slashed tire on her car. her attackers stole her purse with $50 and her cell phone and threatened to kill her if she reported the crime. gardner and another woman, cheyenne fisher, have been charged with robbery in connection to the incident. willis is traumatized and afraid to leave her house due to the attack and the lingering fear for her safety. police are continuing to investigate the case.
2346	a 23-year-old window fitter named david curson, who was described as a "happy-go-lucky" individual, hanged himself months before his wedding due to a supposedly "bad trip" triggered by his recreational use of cocaine, an inquest in bolton heard. although he was an occasional user, mr. curson agreed to stop using the drug at the request of his fiancée, anne-marie johnson. however, he took it again while house-sitting for his mother, leading to a lethally depressive comedown. the coroner, jennifer leeming, recorded a narrative verdict, stating that mr. curson may not have intended to take his own life and noted that the depressive effects of cocaine could be dangerous and inexplicable, even to those who use it occasionally. family and friends, including mr. curson's father and work colleague, expressed their shock and sadness over his tragic and untimely death.
2347	the article discusses the importance of airline branding through plane designs, and how mergers and acquisitions in the industry have led to an increase in planes being repainted with new identities. american airlines and us airways are the latest to merge, forming the largest airline in the world, with up to 73 planes set to be repainted by the end of 2023 to reflect the new branding. the new design will include silver paint with silver stripes on the tail, representing a modern and reflective look, although some critics argue that the old logo, featuring an eagle and double "a," has been radically changed. in recent years, us carriers have consolidated from six to three, with mergers leading to careful branding decisions. for example, united kept its recognized name and continental's logo to bring continuity, while delta absorbed northwest airlines' distinctive globe logo. repainting planes to reflect new branding is a common occurrence in europe, with british midland international and germanwings being recent examples. the process can use large amounts of spray paint, with planes requiring around 750 liters for a single repaint. walsh predicts more consolidation in the industry, which will likely lead to more repainting of planes.
2348	argentinian president cristina kirchner met with pope francis i at the vatican yesterday, requesting his intervention regarding the falkland islands dispute between argentina and britain. the two leaders have a history of disagreements, particularly over socially liberal policies and same-sex marriage. during their three-hour private and informal meeting, kirchner presented the pope with traditional argentine gifts, including a mate gourd and straw for tea. it is unclear how the pope responded to her request. world leaders, including zimbabwe's robert mugabe and us vice president joe biden, are attending pope francis i's installation mass in rome today. mugabe, who is exempted from europe's travel ban, met with the pope yesterday at the vatican hotel. taiwanese president ma ying-jeou also arrived in rome yesterday, expressing hopes for improved relations with the vatican. pope francis i, known for his informal style, made an unconventional call to the vatican receptionist directly, but was initially met with skepticism before being identified as the pope. the installation mass is expected to attract over a million people and will mark the first time the spiritual leader of the orthodox christians, ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i, attends a papal installation since the roman catholic and orthodox churches split a millennium ago.

2351	the rojhanis, a florida family, stopped paying their mortgage on their 2-year-old home in april due to health concerns caused by chinese-manufactured drywall. they believe the drywall is emitting corrosive gasses that are causing upper respiratory infections, copper wiring failure, and appliance damage. the family, along with homeowners in 13 states, are facing foreclosure or the prospect of paying both their mortgage and rent as they seek relief. the environmental protection agency (epa) has discovered sulfur, strontium, and certain elements found in acrylic paints in the chinese drywall, but has not yet established a definitive link to the reported health issues. homeowners are turning to the government for assistance, with some homeowners receiving temporary reprieves on mortgage payments, but the long-term outcomes are unclear. the center for disease control and prevention, the epa, and the u.s. consumer product safety commission are conducting studies on the health effects of the drywall. several homeowners have already filed lawsuits against their home builders and the chinese manufacturers. the gypsum association estimates that enough chinese drywall was imported during the housing boom to build 30,000 complete homes. florida leads the nation in complaints about the drywall, with other complaints coming from various states. insurance companies are not covering the damages caused by the drywall, adding financial strain to affected families. federal and state representatives are working on legislation to address the issue, including examining the effect of chinese drywall on mortgage foreclosures and studying the availability of property insurance coverage for these homes.
2352	kobe bryant, the los angeles lakers guard and five-time nba champion, likely suffered a torn achilles tendon during a game against the golden state warriors on april 12, 2013. the injury occurred during a normal move toward the hoop, and bryant felt a pop in his left foot before falling to the floor. the lakers are almost certain that bryant will miss the rest of the season due to the injury, which requires months of rehabilitation. bryant, who has played over 38 minutes per game this season and is the fourth-leading scorer in nba history, is disappointed but determined to recover and continue his career. the lakers are currently one game ahead of the utah jazz for the final playoff spot in the western conference with two games remaining, and they may have to do so without bryant if an mri on saturday confirms the diagnosis. bryant, who is making nearly $30.5 million next season in the final year of his contract, has been fiercely competitive and has played through numerous injuries this season. the lakers' offseason is shaping up to be uncertain, with dwight howard's impending free agency still a major concern. bryant is considered one of the greatest competitors in nba history and has been an inspiration to his teammates throughout the season.
2353	the article from cnn discusses the role of born-again and evangelical voters in the upcoming iowa republican caucuses. in the 2008 caucuses, these voters made up a large portion of the republican turnout and helped mike huckabee secure an upset victory. this year, candidates michele bachmann, rick perry, and rick santorum are hoping to replicate huckabee's success. however, the article points out that iowa's republican voters in new hampshire have historically been skeptical of candidates perceived as too religious, as evidenced by huckabee's distant third-place finish in the 2008 new hampshire primary, and pat robertson's fifth-place showing and 9% of the votes in the same primary in 1988. a survey of 64 iowa republican insiders was conducted by cnn, and only 46% believed that if one of the more conservative candidates finished strongly in iowa, they would be able to consolidate the born-again/evangelical vote and become a significant factor in the republican nominating contest. the skepticism was informed by the failures of previous candidates to capitalize on strong iowa showings to win the nomination. the results of the survey suggest that despite the potential influence of born-again and evangelical voters in iowa, the road to the nomination is still uncertain for those candidates.

2377	the analysis of sickest swine flu patients in australia, canada, mexico, and new zealand reveals that relatively healthy adolescents and young adults are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms and respiratory failure from h1n1 infection. the mortality rate ranges from 14.3% to 41.4%, depending on the country. young patients often require mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admission within a few days of developing symptoms. the studies also suggest that young, healthy individuals can quickly develop respiratory failure which may not be reversible with mechanical ventilation but are currently not a priority group for h1n1 vaccination. the authors call for increased preparation and investment in antivirals, antibiotics, and mechanical ventilation systems to combat the upcoming flu season. the analysis highlights the importance of h1n1 vaccination for children, stating that it is safe and similar to the regular flu vaccine in terms of safety. the mortality rate of h1n1 is reportedly similar to that of seasonal flu but can result in regrettable deaths due to insufficient planning and preparation.

2380	experts believe that dinosaurs, including pachycephalosaurids or "pachys," breathed through their noses for both smelling their surroundings and cooling their brains. a team of scholars from ohio university employed computational fluid dynamics and 3d modeling to explore how air flowed through the nasal passages of modern-day animals like ostriches and alligators, using these findings to reconstruct the breathing patterns of pachycephalosaurids. the research revealed the presence of nasal turbinates, which are delicate scrolls of bone responsible for filtering and humidifying air, both in the back of the nasal cavity for smelling and the front part for respiration. the discovery of these structures in pachycephalosaurids and their similarities with modern-day animals imply that they may have had a keen sense of smell and efficient cooling mechanisms for their relatively small brains. the scientists are now working on investigating the breathing patterns of other dinosaur species.

2393	in phoenix, arizona, the immigration debate was explored from various perspectives. a common fear presented in the debate is the existence of "terror babies," children born to illegal immigrants in the u.s. who, as citizens, could eventually return as terrorists. however, there is no credible evidence supporting this claim. it is an exaggerated fear used by politicians like texas representative debbie riddle and u.s. congressman louie gohmert to fuel their anti-immigration agenda. the fbi, which supposedly provided information on these terror babies, denies the existence of any such plans. the phenomenon in arizona involves justifying the state's strict immigration law not just by scaring people but also through extrememakeovers, such as redefining citizenship and illegal immigrants as future terrorists or drug mules. ultimately, these false narratives are driven by a political motivation rather than truth or reality. the author emphasizes that if supporters of the immigration law truly believe in its merits, they should be able to make their case without fabricating issues, exaggerating risks, or resorting to scare tactics.

2400	the republican primary race for the presidential nomination is heating up as the halfway point approaches, and the question of inevitability for former massachusetts governor mitt romney's campaign is a topic of conversation. while romney holds a significant lead in delegates, with 519, his opponents former senator rick santorum, former house speaker newt gingrich, and representative ron paul still have a mathematical chance to win the nomination with 239, 138, and 69 delegates, respectively. the primary contests come down to amassing as many delegates as possible, with 1,144 needed to win the nomination. the allocation of delegates varies from state to state, and the road to 1,144 is challenging for all candidates due to proportional delegates and winner-take-all contests. unpledged delegates, who are not required to vote based on the state results, could play a significant role in the outcome. the campaign strategies of santorum, gingrich, and paul differ, with santorum focusing on the may contests, gingrich leveraging texas and endorsements, and paul attempting to pick up delegates during state conventions. the importance of unpledged delegates and the crucial role of party leaders, such as the party chair and national committee members, cannot be overlooked as they can influence delegates on the second or third ballot in a brokered convention. romney aims to lock up delegates before the convention to avoid a floor fight and prepare for the general election against president barack obama.

2543	a high court judge, mr justice wilkie, has ordered relaxations on strict curbs placed on a 24-year-old somali man considered a potential suicide bomber and one of the country's most dangerous terror suspects, nicknamed "cf." the judge believes the existing rules, which restrict cf's movements, computer usage, and social interactions under terrorism prevention and investigation measures (tpims), are disproportionate and detrimental to cf's social life, ultimately causing embarrassment and isolation. this ruling deals a significant blow to the government's efforts against terrorism, as security services fear cf may contact other extremists to plot attacks against britain. this could pave the way for similar challenges by other terror suspects and raise concerns about the judiciary diluting measures meant to protect the uk from jihadists. cf, charged last year for repeatedly breaching a ban on visiting the olympic games venue, was denied ownership of an mp3 player and a curfew cut in the ruling. a conservative mp, patrick mercer, voiced his opposition to the relaxation of rules, stating that the man's lack of a social life is less concerning than the prospect of him having the opportunity to carry out a suicide attack.

2569	james blunt, a british pop star and old harrovian, has faced criticism and accusations of homophobia after making a joke about "picking up the soap" in the shower with fellow public school alumni including david cameron and boris johnson. the comment came alongside a twitter post featuring the new statesman magazine cover showcasing blunt and his wife, as well as the prime minister and johnson, sipping champagne and wearing white tie evening dress. the gay rights charity stonewall condemned the comment, and blunt was also criticized on social media for perpetuating negative stereotypes and making inappropriate jokes. this is not the first time blunt has made similar remarks, as he previously joked about spending a lot of time with men at public school and as an army captain in 2001. blunt has also made controversial comments about chris bryant, a labour mp, accusing him of classism and prejudice.
2570	a coalition row erupted between the liberal democrats and the conservative education secretary, michael gove, over the implementation of a policy to provide free school meals for children under seven. the liberal democrats announced £150 million to expand kitchens and dining halls to accommodate the expected demand, but the department for education claimed there was no overspend in the maintenance budget to fund the work, which the liberal democrats dismissed as "b*****t." deputy prime minister nick clegg and education secretary michael gove had differing views on how the money should be used, with clegg wanting to expand free school meals, and gove wanting to spend the money on more free schools. the policy will benefit 1.8 million children in england, saving parents over £430-a-year. some of the money has come from new funds from the treasury, but there is a disagreement over where the remaining funds will come from within the department for education budget. the liberal democrats accused the department for education of lying and going rogue, while downing street made it clear that it was the education secretary's department that was out of line. the policy has also been criticized for offering free meals to wealthier families, while denying some older children in need. the £600 million-a-year cost of the meals was first announced by clegg in september and will be funded through new money from the treasury. chancellor george osborne will announce how the money has been raised in his autumn statement tomorrow. the policy has been shown to increase attainment and make pupils healthier in pilot studies.
2571	rick perry, the former texas governor, is considering another run for the presidency after recovering from back surgery and engaging with the conservative base once again. his previous bid was hindered by his stance on immigration, but the current crisis at the southern border has put him back in the spotlight. perry recently met with president barack obama to discuss the issue and criticized the administration's handling of it. perry has been advocating for securing the border since 2010 and is disappointed in obama's response. he has been more vocal in his criticism since their meeting, using stronger language to express his disapproval. perry's political advisers believe that the media's attention on the immigration crisis is giving him a larger platform to voice his concerns. perry's previous presidential bid was derailed by his stance on immigration, specifically his support for government-funded tuition for undocumented immigrants. he was heavily criticized by his rivals during debates and eventually dropped out after disappointing showings in the iowa caucuses and new hampshire primary. perry is now focusing on improving his policy knowledge and international travel as he considers another presidential run. immigration is seen as a potential opportunity for him to make a political comeback, but he will need to walk a tight rope and be eloquent in defending his position to sway republican voters.
2572	wasps ceo nick eastwood has encouraged disgruntled fans angry about the £20million move to the ricoh arena in coventry to vent their frustration towards him instead of the players. wasps are set to face bath in the aviva premiership on sunday, marking the first opportunity for fans to publicly protest the decision. the club, which is currently losing £3m annually, had been kept afloat by a £10m injection from owner derek richardson and was one minute away from administration in 2013. fans' main concerns have been the lack of consultation and the relocation being away from wasps' traditional roots in london and the south-east. eastwood attended a fans' forum on thursday, explaining that negotiations were confidential, and that all options for a site in and around the m25 had been exhausted. he acknowledged the emotional attachment of fans to the club and urged them to give logic a chance to prevail as the club strives to avoid going bust in the future. the number of season ticket holders who will make the move to coventry is yet to be determined.
2573	iranian officials, including gen. hossein salami of the revolutionary guard, have announced their intentions to reverse-engineer the us rq-170 sentinel drone that crashed in iranian territory in early december. they claim to be in the final stages of decoding the aircraft's systems and believe they can mass-produce a superior version. iran denied us accusations of involvement in the drone's demise and dismissed the need for foreign assistance in replicating the technology. gen. salami called the capture a victory for iran and a blow to us intelligence capabilities, but us officials maintain that the drone malfunctioned. the european union is unlikely to impose sanctions on iran's oil exports due to the potential harm to the global crude market.
2574	massive numbers of starfish, including the purple sea star and sunflower sea star, are dying along the us west coast, raising concerns for marine ecosystems. scientists have yet to identify the cause of the die-offs, which span from washington state to california. while previous episodes were linked to warmer waters and reduced starfish populations, the 2013 phenomenon affected millions and covered a larger geographic area. theories suggest a possible parasite or pathogen weakening the sea stars' immune systems, making them more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections. additionally, the loss of starfish will have cascading effects on the ecosystem, with potential consequences for mussel populations and the entire food chain. researchers are collecting data, analyzing specimens, and performing genetic sequencing to determine the cause of the die-offs.
2575	an mma fighter named jonathan koppenhaver, who goes by the name "war machine," is currently in jail and facing multiple charges for allegedly beating his ex-girlfriend, porn star christy mack, in august. mack sustained severe injuries, including a blowout fracture to her left eye, a broken nose in two places, smashed teeth, and internal injuries. war machine has returned to social media with a series of bizarre and self-pitying poems, expressing feelings of victimization and longing for pain to be outside of him. mack is recovering from her injuries and continues to post updates on her social media, including progress pictures and her experiences during the recovery process. she has undergone multiple dental visits and has had some movement in her top lip and liver, but still faces several more procedures. war machine is due back in court on october 17. mack posted graphic images of her injuries online after the attack and it led to an arrest warrant and a manhunt for war machine. the police reported that war machine showed up unannounced at mack's house, attacked her and her friend, and took her phone to cancel her plans. he also allegedly threatened to rape mack but could not perform. mack escaped by running naked outside and knocking on neighbors' doors for help. the relationship between mack and war machine was abusive, with previous incidents of beatings and infidelity. war machine made his ufc debut in 2007, had a 14-5 record, and lost his last fight in october 2013.
2576	early voting in the united states is becoming increasingly popular, with as many as 40% of americans expected to vote before the first tuesday in november. this trend is changing the way campaigns are run and the way voters cast their ballots. early voting has been shown to increase voter participation in some areas, but it also comes with increased costs for states, requiring them to staff polling locations and maintain and secure polling machines for longer periods of time. the obama campaign is using early voting to build a grassroots organization and focus resources more efficiently, while some republicans are still relying on large ad buys. early voting has been particularly popular in the west, where complicated ballots have led to long wait times at polling stations. mail ballots, a part of early voting in some states, can increase the chance of ballots not being counted if voters do not follow procedures carefully. in 2008, over 400,000 absentee ballots were discarded due to improper filling out.
2577	a television advertisement for e45 cream, featuring a young woman speaking about her "addiction" to the moisturizer, has received complaints from viewers for trivializing drug abuse. the advert, which has been pulled, uses a thin, pale-looking model, seated in a dark basement and confessing to being hooked on e45. critics and a support group for addicts have accused the campaign of exploiting addiction stereotypes. e45 body lotion is a market leader, and the complainants included viewers on twitter and facebook. the advertising standards authority has received sixty complaints and is investigating. reckitt benckiser, the company that manufactures e45, was not available for comment.

2579	the wales vs. england six nations opener is expected to be a tough, fast-paced match at the millennium stadium in cardiff. the midfield will be a focus area, with wales' jamie roberts and jonathan davies looking to gain ground and create gaps in the english defense, while ford and england's centers will need to defend effectively. the scrum could also be decisive as england looks to improve upon their performance in the last match at the stadium. discipline and the kicking game are also crucial factors, with ford and youngs expected to provide variety in england's kicking game and wales' halfpenny known for his goal-kicking prowess. at the breakdown, england will rely on james haskell to provide quick ball and slow down welsh ball, while warrenball's effectiveness will depend on the brute force of roberts and davies. both coaches have a significant edge in experience, and the game could see surprises in attack and defense. the roof of the stadium will remain open, with no major impact on the game expected due to the chilly and dry forecast.
2580	a woman named julie griffiths from newcastle-under-lyme, staffordshire, who was given a five-year asbo (anti-social behavior order) in december 2012 for disturbing residents with her loud arguments and shouting at her husband, has breached the order by continuing the behavior. the latest incidents, which took place between april and august 2013, involved shouting, swearing, and slamming doors, disturbing her neighbors who have been complaining since 1999. she claimed she didn't understand the conditions of the order and escaped a prison sentence with a 12-month conditional discharge and a £85 costs order. council members described her behavior as "dreadful" and vowed to take action to stop it. griffiths has a history of ignoring previous noise abatement orders.
2581	lib dem peer floella benjamin will call for teaching about the dangers of extreme pornography in schools and a default setting where pornography is blocked on electronic devices unless users specifically request access, in a bid to protect young people from the potential harm of explicit material. under current government plans, every household will be asked whether they want online porn blocked. the lib dems will also urge the coalition to work with the software industry to introduce opt-in filters for explicit material on new internet-enabled devices. benjamin expressed concerns about the impact of pornography on young minds and the increasing number of cases of children being exposed to and engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior. education minister liz truss previously suggested that pornography could already be part of sex education in schools. the nspcc has warned of an increase in cases of children sexually assaulting other children.

2583	marijuana legalization initiatives passed in several states including alaska, oregon, and the district of columbia in november 2014. florida's medical marijuana law failed due to a required 60% voter approval. in 2016, several more states are expected to consider marijuana legalization, including california and massachusetts. a majority of americans now support marijuana legalization, but federal law still prohibits it. marijuana's impact on usage and harms have not been significantly affected by legalization in colorado, where commercialization started in 2009. federal law creates issues for the marijuana industry, such as lack of access to financial institutions and difficulty for medical researchers. the best approach to fully realizing the potential of marijuana legalization is for federal law to remove it from the controlled substances act or reschedule it under the act. medicalization, which would allow doctors to prescribe marijuana under federal law, is a more cautious approach, but also has limitations. the u.s. has outlawed marijuana for 77 years, with negative consequences, and it's hoped that congress will catch up with the changing public sentiment and state laws.
2584	a 22-year-old convicted robber named luke jackel flouted jail rules by updating his facebook status several times while serving his sentence, making posts such as "f*** them police and judge ha" and joking about getting drunk in prison. the posts were made despite access to facebook being a punishable offense. it is believed that jackel may have avoided reprimand due to being released early from prison while the facebook activity was under investigation. jackel was sentenced to two years and nine months in prison for a knifepoint robbery in february 2011, along with his accomplice jake bell. the prison service terminated active prisoner profiles on facebook and confirmed that inmates have no internet access or permission to update their profiles while serving their sentences.

2586	james robertson, a 56-year-old detroit resident, has walked a 21-mile round trip commute to his job in rochester hills, michigan, for the past ten years. he does this five days a week, rain or shine, because his car broke down over a decade ago, and bus service only covers part of the route. despite the grueling commute and the cold, dark nights, robertson refuses to take time off and has never missed a day of work. his boss, todd wilson, admires his work ethic and calls him an attendance role model. robertson claims to power his long commute with two liters of mountain dew and countless cans of coke each day. colleagues and a local resident have provided him with rides occasionally, but his situation may change after an online campaign raised almost $42,000 for him to buy a car.
2587	amber le bon, daughter of model yasmin le bon, turned heads at fashion night out in westfield last week with her shocking pink and blue dyed hair. the model, who previously had chocolate brown locks, boldly dyed half of her blonde streaks herself. her mother, yasmin, recently caused a stir with her edgy short hairstyle. fashion night out is a global initiative to encourage shopping and support the fashion industry, and included giveaways and competitions at various stores in westfield. amber's drastic new hair style was a hit with onlookers, including jessica wright and sam faiers from the only way is essex. amber's boyfriend, jonny hynes, also approved of her bold new look. yasmin's short, slicked back hair with an undercut seemed to channel a 90s style, and she pulled off the look with her radiant skin. though dip dyeing is not for the faint of heart, it can be maintained with proper care to ensure longevity of the color.
2588	a senate report released on october 3, 2012, criticized the 77 fusion centers, which are part of a multibillion-dollar information-sharing network among local, state, and federal officials, for violating americans' civil liberties and failing to produce valuable intelligence on terrorism. the report found that fusion centers improperly collected information about innocent citizens, and their reports seldom dealt with terrorism. instead, much of the money went towards ordinary crime-fighting, including expensive equipment like laptops, televisions, and vehicles. the report called out the department of homeland security (dhs) for wasteful spending, while dhs disagreed with the report's conclusions, saying it was outdated and inaccurate. regardless, fusion centers have remained politically important for state and local governments due to the significant federal funding they receive, even though their reports were found to be useless or infringing on civil liberties. the convoluted grants process makes it difficult for the federal government to determine how fusion center funding is being used, leading to millions spent on programs with questionable impact on counterterrorism efforts.
2589	brickhouse security, a security company, is providing free gps tracking devices to churches to help prevent the theft of baby jesus figurines from nativity scenes. the matchbox-sized device can be hidden on or in the figurine, and if stolen, will alert the owner with a text or email, allowing law enforcement to locate and recover the stolen item. the program, called "save jesus," has been running for eight years and has been adopted by an increasing number of churches every year. reverend george smith from st. mark's episcopal church in glen ellyn, illinois, shared a personal experience of losing two wise men figurines and expressed gratitude for the offer of a free tracking device to prevent further thefts. despite the program's success, brickhouse security ceo todd morris hopes that it won't be necessary in the future.

2591	the formula 1 calendar includes iconic circuits like monaco and silverstone, but next week's japanese grand prix will feature a new track at fuji speedway, which hasn't hosted an f1 race since 1977. the circuit, which was the setting for the classic arcade game "pole position," has undergone significant changes, with german architect hermann tilke leading the redesign in 2003. f1 teams prepare for the unfamiliar circuit using computer simulations and virtual testing, with bmw sauber and toyota f1 teams analyzing every detail of the track layout, including downforce levels, gear ratios, and brake specifications. the long main straight and relatively twisty track will require a balance between maximum speed and optimal grip. the testing is aimed to ensure that lap times and top speed calculated using simulation software vary by no more than one percent from the actual values, but unpredictable incidents during the race can significantly impact strategy. despite some controversies surrounding the switch from suzuka to fuji, the japanese grand prix is set to alternate hosting locations between fuji and suzuka after 2009.
2592	monster beverage corporation is facing a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of a 14-year-old girl, anais fournier, who died from caffeine toxicity after consuming two 24-ounce cans of monster energy drink within 24 hours. the food and drug administration (fda) is currently investigating reports of five deaths and one non-fatal heart attack linked to monster energydrinks, prompting a 14% drop in the company's shares. an autopsy revealed that anais died due to cardiac arrhythmia caused by caffeine toxicity, which impeded her heart's ability to pump blood. her parents claim that monster failed to warn about the risks of consuming its products. the fda investigation does not necessarily prove that the drinks caused the deaths or injuries. monster beverage corp. maintains that its drinks are not responsible for anais' death and intends to vigorously defend itself in the lawsuit. the company's shares fell significantly following the announcements. energy drinks represent about 3% of sales volume in the carbonated soft drink market. heightened scrutiny from state and federal authorities, including investigations by new york state attorney general eric schneiderman and senators dick durbin and richard blumenthal, has increased due to the rising sales volume of energy drinks.
2593	reports of a possible cease-fire in gaza brokered by egypt emerged on tuesday, but any long-term truce is uncertain without addressing the root causes of conflict between israel and hamas. the latest israeli offensive in gaza is the sixth major military operation since israel withdrew from the strip in 2005 and the first since the "cast lead" campaign in 2008. egypt, as a key player with a stake in gaza's stability, may act as a peacemaker. israel seeks an end to rocket attacks from gaza, while hamas wants the blockade lifted and borders reopened. however, neither side appears to have a clear endgame, and the underlying grievances of both sides must be addressed to prevent continued violence. egypt's relations with israel and the us have been strained due to their open support for israeli military action. hamas is expected to emerge from the latest conflict with increased political power, while palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas has been criticized for his ineffectiveness. egypt is best positioned to mediate a solution that addresses the needs of all parties, including reconciliation between fatah and hamas. reestablishing palestinian unity is crucial for salvaging abbas' leadership and weakening hamas' ties to iran. while challenges exist, including israeli and us opposition to palestinian reconciliation, a grand bargain that addresses the concerns of all parties may be the best way to prevent future conflicts.
2594	a federal judge dismissed a cyberstalking case against william lawrence cassidy for his threatening tweets and blog posts towards buddhist leader alyce zeoli, ruling that they were protected under the first amendment. zeoli, a public figure and subject of a 2000 book, cooperated with the fbi in having cassidy indicted on interstate stalking charges. cassidy argued that the charges violated freedom of speech. the judge, roger w. titus, agreed, likening twitter and blogs to billboards and concluding that the first amendment protects speech, even if it challenges religious beliefs, political attitudes, or conventional standards of good taste. zeoli was "appalled and frightened" by the ruling, and an appeal may be pursued. cassidy's public defenders are working to release him from jail. the ruling sparks debate over whether threatening posts on social media should be protected.
2595	a new poll in scotland reveals that a third of voters prefer a labour-snp coalition, which could potentially see alex salmond in the british cabinet. ed miliband faces the possibility of a labour wipeout in scotland, making a power-sharing deal with the snp a potential option to secure an overall majority in the may general election. although scottish first minister nicola sturgeon has previously ruled out a formal coalition with labour, she has indicated the possibility of a confidence and supply arrangement. miliband has yet to categorically rule out such a deal. the poll shows that 35.1% of scottish voters prefer a labour-snp coalition, with 19.8% wanting a majority labour government, while 13.8% back a conservative majority. a further 7% intend to vote lib dem, among other smaller parties, and the snp is expected to win 52 seats and labour to be reduced to just six. miliband has refrained from ruling out a deal with the snp during a recent interview, despite previously stating he is "not about deals and coalitions."

2605	a london man was arrested on suspicion of making roadside bombs in iraq during the conflict between 2003-2011. the 37-year-old, who remains in custody, is facing investigation by scotland yard's counter-terrorism command. roadside bombs, also known as improvised explosive devices (ieds), accounted for nearly two-thirds of all deaths suffered by american and british forces and their allies in iraq. insurgents often hid ieds in everyday items like drinks cans and food boxes or even used donkey carts loaded with explosives. ieds were used to slow down military columns, force vehicles off course, or even directly target troops. thousands of british troops were deployed to iraq following the us-led invasion in 2003, which toppled dictator saddam hussein. the conflict led to widespread violence and fears of terror attacks in the uk, with hundreds of british citizens traveling to iraq to join insurgent groups and later planning attacks at home. the use of ieds led to significant changes in british military vehicle design to deflect explosions and protect troops. britain and the us began withdrawing their military forces in 2009, with the last troops returning home in 2011. al-qaeda leader abu musab al-zarqawi made several appeals for foreign fighters to travel to iraq, and he was killed in 2006. currently, comments are not being accepted on this article.

2629	drones, which were once used primarily by military experts for secretive surveillance missions, have become a controversial and increasingly popular tool for the us military and are raising concerns for domestic use. president obama signed a law in 2012 to allow drones in us airspace by 2015, with potential uses including border patrol, criminal hunting, and maintaining crops. some police forces in the us have already shown interest in using drones, some of which could be equipped with face- recognition software, but concerns over privacy and government intrusion have emerged. drones have been used heavily by the us military to spy and kill enemy fighters, and their use has increased dramatically in the past decade, with over 11,000 in use by the us military and over 50 countries using them as well. the small size of some drones, including those that are just the size of a hummingbird, has added to the controversy. the federal aviation administration (faa) has issued over 1,400 permits for drone use since 2007, with an estimated 10,000 drones expected to take to the skies by 2020. however, opposition from privacy and civil liberties groups has led to restrictions on their use in some us states. the article also notes that drones could potentially replace most manned military aircraft in the future.

2633	the independent institute for fiscal studies (ifs) has warned that chancellor george osborne will need to impose significant spending cuts, estimated at £21 billion, to maintain the current pace of reductions after the next election. this would mean slashing welfare or increasing taxes. the think-tank suggested a "fundamental re-imagining of the role of the state" if public spending is reduced to 35.2% of gdp by 2018-19. the government's decision to protect spending on areas like health, schools, and foreign aid means deeper cuts to other sectors, such as defence, transport, and the home office. plans to name and shame serial tax dodgers could unfairly target the innocent, critics argue. the ifs also warned that labour's slower plan to reduce the deficit would result in additional borrowing of around £25 billion. the chancellor defended his proposals, insisting voters faced a choice between his plan for economic prosperity and a return to the chaos seen under labour. the lack of tax revenue growth is causing concerns, with the office for budget responsibility producing a £21 billion shortfall in expected revenues by 2017-18. osborne aims for a budget surplus of £23 billion by 2019-20, which would require an additional £14 billion in cuts. the ifs expressed disappointment in the progress made towards reducing the deficit, with the gap between spending and income falling by only £6 billion in the past year.
2634	new jersey governor chris christie criticized president barack obama for not speaking firmly enough on israel's behalf against hamas, saying the country no longer trusts it has the full support of the united states. christie made these remarks during the unrest in the middle east, as israel targeted civilian institutions with suspected hamas ties and declared it would increase bombardment of northern gaza. israel claims to be acting in self-defense against hamas rockets. palestinian protests have occurred across the world over the crisis in gaza. christie urged obama to condemn hamas' actions against israel and be a forceful voice for democracy in the region. israel widened its bombing targets and deployed ground troops inside gaza for the first time. more than 156 palestinians have been killed in the past five days. the un security council called for a cease-fire, and foreign ministers from the uk, france, and germany will discuss cease-fire efforts on sunday. so far, neither israel nor hamas has signaled a willingness to stop. the israeli military has carried out over 1,200 air strikes this week and plans to attack northern gaza with "great force" to prevent rocket attacks from there. christie is a potential 2016 presidential contender and has spoken more aggressively on international affairs in recent months, despite having limited foreign policy experience.
2635	a 16-year-old boy, willian cornick, was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum tariff of 20 years for murdering spanish teacher ann maguire in leeds. penelope gibbs, the chairman of the standing committee for youth justice, criticized the sentence as too long and out of line with western european countries. gibbs argued that there is no evidence to justify the 20-year minimum and that prisons, such as grendon, can effectively rehabilitate offenders in less time. her comments were criticized on twitter, but some agreed that the focus should be on the impact on the victim and the need for rehabilitation. cornick attacked maguire from behind in a classroom and made threats to kill other teachers. he showed no remorse after the crime and even expressed a desire for more murders. the sentence was described as a "monumental act of cowardice and evil" by ann maguire's widower, don.
2636	a wave of foreclosed properties is flooding the housing market, causing property value declines, family displacement, and municipal financial struggles. however, some buyers view this as an opportunity to purchase homes at ultra-low prices. interested buyers from various locations, including foreign countries, are contacting real estate agents to buy foreclosed properties in bulk. for example, an investor wants to buy 200 houses under $10,000. prospective homeowners can also benefit from this situation by considering first-time home ownership. for instance, a friend of real estate agent tonya perkins-stoudermire of mcmullan realty in cleveland bought a low-priced foreclosed house with two baths, a two-car garage, and two fireplaces. however, experts warn against hasty decisions. buyers should carefully evaluate repair costs, the neighborhood, past utilities usage, landscaping, and property conditions. home inspections are essential, even for cash transactions, as previous inspections only offer a snapshot in time. the department of housing and urban development (hud) offers advantages, such as regular appraisals and property condition reports, but a private inspection is still recommended. investors should not expect quick profits and may face penalties for neglectful property ownership. overall, investing in foreclosed properties requires careful planning, homework, and dedication.
2637	kim kardashian, with her 22 million instagram followers, has more followers than the population of scandinavia. in november, she attempted to "break the internet" with provocative nude pictures. as a child psychiatrist and mother, i am not surprised by her exhibitionism or desire for publicity, but i am concerned about the disconnect between what educators and policy makers are saying about growing up in the digital world and the reality of popular culture. the american academy of pediatrics recommends no screen time before age 2 and less than 2 hours for older kids, but statistics show that tweens and teenagers average over 8 hours a day. parents struggle with balancing respecting their children's privacy and spying on them, and the dialogue has focused on fear of screen time and its potential negative effects on empathy and relationships. researchers suggest that interactive screen time and teaching kids how to use their devices responsibly can help develop empathy. the goal should be to encourage children to use their devices responsibly and thoughtfully, rather than taking them away. parents need to have a dialogue with their children about online celebrity and the cost of "facebook fame." monitoring and cultivating online resilience is essential, but it should be done with transparency and open communication rather than spying. kim kardashian, as an adult who has charted a course online, can serve as a discussion point for parents on the importance of choosing what to share and the potential consequences of online overexposure.

2640	the supreme court granted a request from utah officials to delay the recognition of hundreds of same-sex marriages performed in december 2013 and january 2014. the state argued that recognizing these marriages before constitutional issues are fully resolved would be disruptive. the utah court of appeals previously ruled the state's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage violated equal protection rights, leading to about 1,300 same-sex marriages. similar developments occurred in colorado, where county clerks were ordered to cease issuing same-sex marriage licenses until the issue is fully decided. both utah and colorado plan to ask the supreme court to settle the constitutional debate. the supreme court's temporary action does not signal its ultimate decision on the larger constitutional issues surrounding same-sex marriage.
2641	the average dress size of british women has increased from 12 to 16 in the past decade, yet fashion stores continue to display clothes on size 10 mannequins. the government and equality minister jo swinson have urged retailers to use mannequins that reflect more diverse body shapes for promoting body confidence among women. debenhams in oxford street, london, is leading the way by showcasing a range of size 16 mannequins. healthy eating campaigners believe this change could help prevent low self-esteem and guilt felt by women with fuller figures, caused by the false representation of body image in fashion. not all retailers are following suit, with some arguing their mannequins match their customer profiles. the debate around body confidence and realistic representation in fashion has been ongoing for years. in the late 1990s, us president bill clinton criticized the fashion industry for promoting unhealthy body images. despite this, british fashion insiders argue that retailers are already making efforts to address body confidence by offering wide size ranges and figure-flattering fashion tips.

2707	a study published in the american journal of epidemiology suggests that following the paleo or caveman diet, which consists of unprocessed foods like fruit, vegetables, nuts, and lean meat, could reduce the risk of bowel cancer by up to 51% for men and 29% for women. the diet, which has gained popularity as a fashionable way to lose weight, has been shown to lower the risk of developing colorectal adenomas, a benign tumor that is a precursor to the disease. the study involved 2,301 men and women, and the results showed that those with the most paleolithic diet regimes had a lower risk of developing colorectal adenomas compared to those with a more modern diet. however, nutritionists advise that it's not possible for people to live like cavemen in the 21st century and suggest weaving those good messages into our lifestyles by buying fresh, unprocessed food and cooking it from scratch for most meals. the paleo diet shares similarities with the atkins diet but differs in that it encourages a wide range of fresh fruit and vegetables, while the atkins diet is known for its strict approach to reducing carbohydrates and includes processed meat and dairy products.
2708	teodoro nguema obiang mangue, the malibu-based son of equatorial guinea's president, has agreed to surrender more than $30 million worth of his assets as part of a settlement with the u.s. government. the assets include a mansion in california, a ferrari, and michael jackson memorabilia, except for the singer's famous crystal-encrusted "bad tour" glove, a jacket from the "thriller" tour, and a $38.5 million gulfstream jet. he will pay an additional $1 million to cover the value of the memorabilia elsewhere, and any attempt to bring the items back into the u.s. will result in their seizure. mangue, who reportedly paid $482,000 for the glove in the late 1980s, had amassed his wealth through extortion, embezzlement, and corruption, according to u.s. authorities. the settlement includes the selling of the assets to benefit the people of equatorial guinea and paying the u.s. government $10.3 million. despite recent oil and gas wealth, equatorial guinea remains a relatively impoverished country, and most of its residents live below the poverty line. u.s. authorities have accused mangue and other officials of plundering their country's coffers in the economic boom years. the equatorial guinea embassy and teodoro nguema obiang mangue could not be reached for comment.
2709	dutch mps are calling for an investigation into allegations that young men under the age of 21 were castrated by the roman catholic church in the 1950s to rid them of homosexuality or as punishment for reporting clergy abuse. one identified victim, henk heithuis, was castrated after reporting monks for abusing him in a catholic boarding home. the dutch newspaper nrc handelsblad revealed the case, and sources claim surgical removal of testicles was a treatment for homosexuality and a punishment for accusers. the dutch prime minister at the time, vic marijnen, who was also vice-chairman of the dutch catholic child protection agency, is accused of having links to the case. several hundred catholic clergy and church employees were identified as abusers in a government inquiry, but there is evidence that government inspectors were aware of the castrations and did not involve parents or report the incidents. the investigation received reports of henk heithuis' castration but did not pursue it further. mps are demanding an independent parliamentary investigation to uncover the extent of the scandal, the number of cases, who was involved, and why the government did not act.
2710	the article argues against the practice of colorblindness in the workplace, particularly when dealing with performance issues for minority employees. according to research, avoiding race can create more problems than it solves, as minorities are often more skeptical of those who fail to acknowledge race. pretending not to notice race can prevent constructive feedback and make it harder for employees to improve. skilled managers should instead create a cohesive team climate where race can be acknowledged and discussed, allowing employees to be more open and effective in their group discussions and teamwork. the article emphasizes that recognizing the differences among team members, including race, is not about overvaluing these differences but rather acknowledging their existence and allowing for productive discussion.
2711	a 26-year-old man, identified as joshua steven durcho, was arraigned on five counts of first-degree murder for the january strangling deaths of his girlfriend, summer rust, 25, and her four small children in oklahoma. durcho reportedly confessed to choking rust but claimed her children were elsewhere. all five bodies were found in rust's apartment in el reno, oklahoma. durcho is believed to have killed rust in retaliation for her threatening to call the police on him due to his two outstanding bench warrants. he had previously served time in prison for unlawful possession of marijuana and vowed never to return. prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty due to the severe pain and anguish each victim endured while being strangled, and evidence suggests durcho sexually abused the two 7-year-old girls around the time they died. in tuesday's arraignment, durcho's not-guilty pleas were entered on his behalf. according to an affidavit, durcho confessed to an acquaintance that he had killed rust at her apartment and had left oklahoma, and was later arrested in hamilton county, texas. durcho has been appointed public defenders and waived his right to a preliminary hearing.
2712	ed miliband will try to mend his relationship with union leaders during a speech at the tuc conference in bournemouth on tuesday. he will defend unions against criticisms from prime minister david cameron and the conservative party, rejecting margaret thatcher's description of them as the "enemy within." miliband plans to launch a strong defense of trade unionism and will announce reforms to make party membership opt-in for union members instead of opt-out, potentially reducing the number of union members contributing to labour funds. critics argue that labour may face losses if membership does not increase by 300,000 as expected. union leaders and left-wing campaign groups have announced plans for a national day of strikes and civil disobedience on bonfire night in opposition to the government's austerity measures. miliband's speech comes after union leaders voiced their disapproval of his planned reforms, with unite's general secretary len mccluskey emphasizing the positive role unions have played in society. tuc conference merchandise, including mugs that celebrate the death of margaret thatcher, has met with condemnation from conservative mps.

2714	three major incidents involving southeast asian airlines in 2014, including the disappearance of malaysia airlines flight mh370 and the shooting down of flight mh17, have raised concerns about the safety of regional carriers, particularly malaysian ones. however, airasia, which is not a malaysian airline but is majority-owned by indonesian interests, has built a strong reputation for affordable and safe flying, having transported over 200 million passengers with no planes lost until the recent disappearance of flight qz8501. airasia's formidable ceo, tony fernandes, has been praised for his handling of the crisis. although there is no pan-asian low-cost competitor on the same scale as airasia, the way the airline manages the crisis will be crucial in determining its future. the fact that air transport is experiencing phenomenal growth in asia, with the region poised to become the world's largest and most dynamic aviation market, suggests that recent incidents should not be used to make sweeping generalizations about the safety of airlines in the region.

2725	belgian police have warned british border officials against stopping illegal migrants using the "lille loophole" to travel to london via eurostar trains. this involves buying a ticket from brussels to lille and then remaining on the train as it continues tolondon, where border checks are minimal. figures from the uk border agency suggest the use of this loophole has increased significantly in recent months, with around 240 migrants detected in the last five months of 2011 compared to 80 in the first six months. british officials have been threatened with arrest if they try to stop suspected migrants with tickets to lille, as it breaches the schengen agreement on free movement within the european union. the uk government is negotiating with other european countries to resolve the issue. in 2010, just 14 migrants were caught using this route, but the true number is likely to be much higher as only those detected are recorded. concerns have been raised that the loophole could also be exploited by terrorists and people traffickers.

2727	protesters have returned to cairo's tahrir square six months after the revolution that ousted president hosni mubarak. mubarak faces possible death sentence and remains hospitalized. the economy and tourism industry are still struggling, and the coalition that formed during the protests has splintered over different visions for a post-mubarak future. the revolution has fundamentally changed egypt and given millions of voiceless people a voice, but it remains a work in progress. the military, which handed power to a council of generals, remains the final authority and is facing renewed protests for not addressing demands for reform and elections. the division among egyptians over the priorities of the revolution - elections or constitutional reforms - has led to debates and a realization that revolutions are messy. the most likely outcome is that the military will keep some control over international affairs, defense policy, and economic interests in a new government. the focus is also on the upcoming parliamentary elections as a way to clarify the political landscape and establish which factions have the support and capability to push the transition forward. some egyptians are critical of the direction the revolution has taken and are calling for more time for secular political parties to organize. the legacy of mubarak and other former regime figures also remains a contentious issue, with debates over accountability and justice.
2728	the family of nazi war criminal erich priebke, who died in italy at the age of 100 while serving a life term for the 1944 massacre of 335 civilians at the ardeatine caves outside rome, stated that they do not know where his body is after the funeral was disrupted by protests. italian authorities have refused to disclose information about the whereabouts of the casket, which was reportedly taken to a military base following the incident. priebke's lawyer, paolo giachini, expressed concern over the disappearance of the casket and called for clarity. the incident sparked outrage from italy's jewish community due to priebke's refusal to repent for his actions during the war, and he denied the existence of gas chambers in nazi death camps in his final statement. the italian government is reportedly considering contacts with germany regarding the possible burial of priebke's remains in his native land. the funeral was organized by the catholic society of st. piusdespite local opposition, resulting in clashes between the far-right supporters and anti-fascist protesters. the residents of albano laziale, where the funeral was to take place, fear the town may become a symbol or pilgrimage site for neo-nazis if priebke is buried there. priebke had previously escaped justice and lived in argentina for decades until he was extradited to italy in 1998. the controversy over priebke's last burial place has raged for days due to concerns that the grave could become a site of pilgrimage for his neo-nazi fanbase. both his birth town in germany and his adopted homeland of argentina have made it clear that his remains are not welcome in their respective countries. the jewish community in rome has threatened renewed protests if priebke is permitted a tomb in the italian capital, stating that it would be like killing the victims a second time.
2729	a college student named zach tennen, 19, was the victim of an alleged hate crime at a party near michigan state university (msu) campus. he was reportedly beaten unconscious and had his mouth stapled while his attackers made anti-semitic taunts, identifying themselves as members of the ku klux klan and raising nazi salutes. the east lansing police department is investigating the assault, but has not yet classified it as a hate crime. the potential suspect has been identified, and around 20 people at the party reportedly watched the attack but didn't intervene. tennen has a broken jaw and underwent surgery to have it wired shut. his family contacted the anti-defamation league, which is supporting the investigation and urging the police to treat it as a possible hate crime. tennen, a journalism student at msu, said he had only consumed a small amount of alcohol before the attack, and the hospital where he was initially taken did not contact the police. msu's student affairs and services have offered support to the student, and all inquiries about the police investigation should be directed to the east lansing police department.
2730	rome, italy's capital city, is considering establishing an official red light district in the eur business district to reduce the visibility of prostitution and mitigate trafficking. the mayor, ignazio marino, supports the proposal, which will designate a specific area for prostitution and provide services for sex workers. prostitution is legal in italy but has long been an issue for residents, particularly in the eur district where current prostitution occurs on over 20 streets. women selling sex will work in a safer environment, and clients risk fines for engaging in the trade outside the designated area. critics, including some church figures, have condemned the proposal as shameful or as creating 'prostitution ghettos,' but supporters argue it will help shield children and families from the sex trade. the pope, who has called trafficking a 'shameful plague,' has urged governments to act decisively to combat the issue. the plan includes provisions for psychological support and health care for sex workers. if successful, up to three red light zones may be established within the district. approximately nine million italian men have used a prostitute in their lifetime according to a survey.
2731	sayreville high school football team's homecoming game was canceled after seven players were arrested and charged for sexually assaulting younger teammates in the locker room. the alleged assaults, which some have called "pervasive hazing," involved older players pinning down and sexually abusing younger players in the dark, and occurred multiple times between september 19 and 29, affecting four victims. dozens of other players reportedly witnessed the assaults and did nothing. the superintendent acted swiftly, canceling the rest of the season due to "harassment, intimidation and bullying." some parents have protested the decision, downplaying the severity of the situation and expressing concern for scholarship opportunities, while others call for the firing of the entire coaching staff and cancellation of the next season to send a message of zero tolerance for such behavior. the truth behind the incidents will be uncovered through individual questioning of players, and it's likely that the abusive locker room culture has been ongoing for some time.

2735	a three-year-old boy named ernie djedje from sheffield, who had up to 100 seizures a day due to a severe form of childhood epilepsy called west syndrome, underwent pioneering surgery to disconnect half of his brain and has been seizure-free for six months. ernie, who was diagnosed with west syndrome at six weeks old, had seizures that affected his development, causing him to forget skills he had learned.his parents, kelly and franck, described him as being like a nine-month-old baby before the operation, as his development was affected. ernie's condition could not be controlled with medication, so doctors operated on him in june 2013 to disconnect the two hemispheres of his brain in a bid to stop his seizures. since then, he has made improvements in his development and is learning new things. the surgery, called a hemispherectomy, involved disconnecting the outer layer of one half of his brain from the other half to prevent the spread of electrical seizures. ernie's parents are grateful for the surgeons who performed the procedure and are looking forward to life without the constant fear of seizures.

2738	cuba has announced that its citizens will be allowed to stay in hotels previously reserved for foreigners as part of a series of reforms to lift bans on goods and services. this decision comes after the government lifted a ban on cubans owning cell phones last week. although these changes are largely symbolic for most cubans due to high costs, they represent the first tangible reforms under new president raúl castro, who took over from his brother fidel in february. the government also recently approved the sale of computers, microwaves, and dvd players to cubans. the relaxation of these restrictions follows decades of criticism, particularly since the fall of the soviet union in 1991, which left cuba without crucial subsidies and dependent on tourism as its primary source of revenue. at least 10 new hotels will be built in havana between 2008 and 2010. the united states has long sought to isolate cuba's communist government and restricts american travel to the island nation.

2740	the boarding house where lee harvey oswald stayed before assassinating president john f. kennedy in 1963 is up for sale for $500,000. oswald's room at 1026 north beckley in dallas remains unchanged since his stay, except for a change of sheets. the owner, patricia hall, whose grandmother ran the boarding house, hopes the property will be turned into a museum or a bed and breakfast. oswald rented the 5-by-14 room for three weeks while working at the texas school book depository and paid $8 per week. hall, who was 11 at the time, remembers oswald as an ordinary man. after the assassination, gladys johnson, oswald's landlady, scrubbed his name from the records and destroyed the sign-in sheets out of fear and embarrassment. the family allowed oliver stone to film scenes for his 1991 movie, jfk, in the house. since 2009, hall has opened the doors of the house to the public. recently, oswald's ex-wife, marina oswald porter, is selling his wedding ring at auction to break ties with the past. kennedy's 50th assassination anniversary has been commemorated with various events, including a city of dallas commemoration in dealey plaza.

2827	owen cheshire, a 21-year-old from southampton with an iq of 132 and a large nose that affected his self-confidence, underwent a nose job before graduating to enhance his appearance and boost his confidence in the job market. he had long felt self-conscious about his nose and struggled with low self-esteem, which even led to bullying in his teenage years. despite passing his exams and earning a place in college and university, cheshire's confidence issues hindered his social interactions. he felt that in the competitive job market, his self-doubt would prevent him from being considered for the few available positions. therefore, he researched surgeons and had the procedure done, investing £4,000 in what he saw as an improvement in himself. the results exceeded his expectations, and his newfound confidence led him to enjoy posing for graduation photos and eventually securing a job soon after the surgery. cheshire believes that appearing more attractive has given him a better standing in the job market and feels that his chances are as good as anyone else's. he encourages others who feel the same way about their appearance to consider cosmetic surgery as an investment in themselves.

2829	the virginia supreme court has dismissed a multi-million dollar negligence lawsuit filed by the families of two victims of the 2007 virginia tech mass shooting. the families had argued that the state and university officials should have warned students about potential criminal acts by gunman seung-hui cho after the initial shooting in a dormitory. however, the court ruled that there was no duty for the commonwealth to warn students about third-party criminal actions, as cho was the sole responsible party for the tragedy. the court determined that officials had no reason to believe the shooter had not left the area before the mass shooting in norris hall. the families had been awarded $4 million each, but this was later reduced to $100,000 per family. the ruling was welcomed by virginia attorney general ken cuccinelli, who is the republican nominee for governor, and by virginia tech officials. under state law, there is generally no legal duty to warn or protect from the criminal acts of a third party unless a special relationship exists between the parties. school officials expressed satisfaction with the court's decision, acknowledging the pain and loss experienced by the families but emphasizing that cho's actions were the cause.
2830	a high court judge has ordered scotland yard to reveal the identities of two undercover police officers, jim boyling and bob lambert, who had children with women they deceived while infiltrating environmentalist groups in the 1980s and 1990s. the women are suing for emotional trauma and deceit, claiming they were tricked into forming relationships with the officers who used fake identities. boyling and lambert, however, claim they were genuinely in love. the metropolitan police were initially using their 'neither confirm nor deny' (ncnd) policy to prevent the disclosure of the officers' identities, but the judge issued an ultimatum which forced the met to disclose the names in order to defend against the claims. the met confirmed the identities of the officers in court papers earlier this week. the women's lawyers described the ruling as a "devastating blow" for the met, who had been on notice of the case for three and a half years and refused to engage in meaningful discussions with the claimants.

2832	the supreme court heard arguments in the case of town of greece v. galloway, which challenges a new york town's practice of opening board meetings with short prayers. justice elena kagan expressed concerns about the court's involvement in such cases, stating that it often makes the problem of church-state relations worse. the court has a history of making unpredictable and unprincipled decisions regarding church-state relations, religious liberty, and the role of faith in public life. some justices suggested that volunteer-led, nonsectarian prayers at town board meetings might be a sensible policy. the court's decision in this case may not provide a clear solution to the complexities of church-state relations but could avoid making things worse. the author emphasizes that our country is a multireligious society and has tried to respect religious faith and protect religious liberty, with a tradition of public acknowledgments of religion not inconsistent with separating church and state.

2839	the heard app is a new iphone application that records audio on a five-minute loop, allowing users to save and preserve audio they want to keep up to 30 seconds or five minutes after it was originally recorded. despite its practicality, some are skeptical about the app's potential privacy concerns, as it constantly records audio and runs in the background with a red banner notification. the five-minute recording loop sets the app apart from the iphone's native audio recorder, allowing users to save only important clips instead of long recordings. the app costs $1.99 for the full version and has received mixed reactions, with some worrying about the app's legality and potential for misuse in situations where recording people without consent is illegal.
2840	ukrainian authorities have announced the dismantling of an armed group planning to attack the kiev-based government in the eastern city of luhansk. fifteen people were detained and about 300 guns, a grenade launcher, and other weapons were seized. the security service alleges the group was planning an attack on april 10. luhansk, a city with a substantial russian minority near the border with russia, is considered a potential target for russian forces seeking to establish a land bridge to crimea. tensions between ukraine and russia have escalated since ukraine's pro-moscow president was ousted, leading to crimea's annexation by russia and the deployment of tens of thousands of russian troops near ukraine's border. the international community has responded with economic and diplomatic sanctions against russia. us defense secretary chuck hagel warned that "the world will respond" to russia's actions.

2844	a man named william harrington, 56, bought a used reclining leather armchair from ebay two years ago, which turned out to be from a batch of toxic sofas sold by argos and other companies. the chair was treated with a toxic substance called di-methyl fumarate to prevent mold, but it caused harrington to develop painful sores and an itchy rash all over his body. he was poisoned for two years without knowing the cause, and his skin condition left him embarrassed and unable to go swimming or let customers see his arms and legs. the sofa, which cost £80, was withdrawn from shops after complaints of allergic reactions, but the ebay seller failed to warn harrington of its hazardous nature. harrington's gp had never seen such a rash before, and he was diagnosed with toxic substance exposure. the toxic substance is so potent that those who come into contact with it should wear protective clothing and glasses. argos is now investigating the case and has urged harrington to provide information about the seller so that they can cross-reference it with their records and pursue the investigation further. the toxic sofas, which retailed between £600 and £850, were treated with the toxic substance to prevent mold, but they have caused severe skin reactions in some people. harrington's skin condition is improving now that he has removed the chair from his house.

2846	the taliban accused the united states of killing and torturing tens of thousands of afghans in a defiant statement marking the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, claiming it was used as a pretext for violence against muslims. the statement criticized the war in afghanistan, which has resulted in the loss of nearly 2,700 lives across the coalition, including over 1,700 americans. the taliban, an islamic fundamentalist group mostly composed of afghans from the pashtun ethnic group, have led the insurgency against nato-led forces since their ousting from power in 2001. they previously harbored al-qaeda leader osama bin laden who was suspected of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks. the taliban came to power in afghanistan in the 1990s and provided bin laden with a safe haven from 1996 until his departure in 2001. the un reported that 1,462 civilians had been killed in the first six months of 2021, with 80% of the deaths caused by anti-government insurgents. air strikes caused the most civilian deaths at the hands of international forces, while insurgent attacks, primarily from homemade explosives and suicide attacks, resulted in the majority of civilian fatalities.

2852	in san angelo, texas, the prosecution rested their case in the sexual assault trial of warren jeffs, the leader of the fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, after playing an audiotape allegedly documenting the assault of a 12-year-old girl. the recording contained praying at the beginning and end, with a man identified as jeffs addressing the victim by name. jurors listened intently and reacted emotionally to the recording, with some covering their mouths and wiping tears from their eyes. the tape was seized from jeffs' car during his arrest in 2006. jeffs is charged with two counts of sexual assault on a child and one count of bigamy in connection to a 2008 raid on a ranch where his church operated in eldorado, texas. he is expected to be tried on the bigamy charge later. during tuesday's trial, jurors heard audio recordings of jeffs instructing a 14-year-old victim and his wives on how to sexually please him, which jeffs repeatedly objected to on religious grounds. the judge overruled him, stating that there could be "no claim of privilege, regardless of the religion, with respect to communications directly relevant to sexual assault of a child." prosecutors presented three witnesses on tuesday and are expected to call more during the trial, which started last week and is believed to last two to three weeks. jeffs, who began representing himself on thursday, has made frequent objections on religious grounds throughout the trial. he was on the fbi's 10 most wanted list when he was arrested in 2006 and was previously convicted of being an accomplice to rape in utah but had his convictions overturned on appeal. the texas legal proceedings were set off after about 400 children were taken from the sect's yearning for zion ranch in 2008 due to allegations of sexual abuse but most were returned to their families after the texas supreme court ruled that the
2853	a new prostate cancer drug, cabazitaxel, which can extend the life of men with advanced prostate cancer by an average of three months, has been rejected for use on the nhs in england and wales due to cost concerns. the national institute for health and clinical excellence (nice) stated that the drug, made by sanofi, is not cost-effective despite being fast-tracked in the us as a last chance treatment for prostate cancer sufferers. men in england will have to apply to the cancer drugs fund to access the drug, while those in wales do not have a similar fund. nice admits that the drug works but says it is not value for money due to its side effects and high cost of around £22,000 for a one-off treatment. men whose cancer has progressed despite current treatments have limited options, and cabazitaxel is one of only two licensed drugs available in the uk that offers hope for extra time. nice's decision means that some men may not be able to access the drug in time for it to benefit them, leading to a potential postcode lottery. the independent committee appraising the drug concluded that it would not provide enough health benefit to justify its cost. nhs bodies can make funding decisions locally until nice issues final guidance, and those currently taking the drug can continue treatment. sanofi is disappointed with nice's decision and believes the drug offers significant clinical benefit to meet the needs within the nhs. approximately 35,000 men in the uk are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, with around 10,000 having locally advanced disease who might be eligible for the drug.

2945	researchers at the university of bonn have discovered a new signalling pathway, involving the molecule adenosine and its receptor a2a, that can turn white fat cells into brown ones, which convert excess energy into heat instead of creating flab. previous research showed that white fat cells are responsible for muffin tops and overall flab, while brown fat cells help burn excess energy. the team, led by professor alexander pfeifer, found that brown fat cells respond to adenosine by activating fat burning. by transferring the a2a receptor gene from brown fat cells to white fat cells in mice, they were able to initiate the "browning" process and energy burning in white fat cells. the mice lost weight as a result, leading the researchers to suggest that adenosine-a2a signalling plays a critical role in brown fat activation and can potentially be used as a new approach to treating obesity. however, further investigation and clinical application are still needed.

2976	four unsuspecting individuals were subjected to an elaborate prank in which they were asked to cover up a violent crime and hide evidence for a loved one. using actors posing as police, hidden cameras, and secret microphones, the friends were told their friend was in trouble and needed their help. they willingly hid bundles of cash and incriminating evidence, but when the police arrived, all lied about their whereabouts of the friend. two were taken away for questioning, while the others tried to escape. the truth was revealed when they were met by the pranksters. the experiment was conducted to promote the new drama series "how to get away with murder." a recent survey revealed that one-third of britons would be willing to do jail time for a loved one and over half would lie to the police. the survey showed that people are most likely to break the law for their children, followed by their partner and parents. men were more likely than women to protect their spouse. behavioural psychologist emma kenny explained that humans have a strong instinct to protect loved ones from danger, but the lines between right and wrong are becoming blurred in today's society.

2978	the first editions of the brothers grimm fairy tales, released in 1812, contained darker versions of children's stories than what is commonly known today. in these original tales, rapunzel became pregnant after having a "merry time" with her prince, and her stepsisters tried to cut off parts of their feet to fit into cinderella's slipper. hansel and gretel's biological mother abandoned them in the forest, and snow white's real mother ordered the huntsman to kill her and bring back her lungs and liver as proof. the grimm brothers changed the stories in later editions due to societal influences, such as motherhood and stepsister jealousy during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. jack zipes, a professor emeritus of german and comparative literature, translated and published the complete first edition of the grimm tales last month, maintaining that changes made to the tales in later editions did not diminish their worth and that they originated from various sources. zipes' book offers insight into how the collection has evolved over time, with around 50 tales being either deleted or heavily revised by the seventh edition in 1857.

3	it's not always the case that friends are seated strictly on one side or the other. however, some couples choose to follow the tradition of seating the bride's family and friends on one side and the groom's family and friends on the other. ultimately, the seating arrangement can be arranged according to the couple's preferences.
4	A: maybe you should lie down and rest, just to be safe.

32	A: my apologies, i must have gotten the floor number wrong. goodbye, b.
33	the bus makes stops along the way, but lakeside park is one of its destinations.
34	A: ok, never mind then. i'll wait until we find a legal parking spot to buy some drinks.

39	A: that's great to hear. happy browsing!
40	B: i understand how you feel, a. it can be frustrating when someone makes a big purchase that we perceive as unnecessary. have you talked to bob about how you feel?
41	A: i'm glad to hear that. congratulations once again on your new role. you'll excel in this position.
42	i haven't heard from him yet. maybe there was a delay with his travel plans.
43	A: i appreciate the assistance. have a nice day.
44	B: please include a clear instruction to return the completed survey to your office by a specific deadline. you could write: "we kindly ask that you please complete the enclosed survey and return it to our office by [date]. your valuable feedback is greatly appreciated."

46	i look forward to spring as well. (a)
47	B: i didn't ask for that information, i don't care about her going to america.
48	i'll help you with that. (assisting a in putting their luggage in the overhead bin)
49	A: thank you, b. we now have a better description: medium height (around 5'9"-5'10"), medium build, no prominent marks on the face, black or dark brown straight hair of average length, wearing a plaid shirt and hiking boots. this description should help narrow down the suspect pool.
50	A: i work in technology.
51	certainly, i can extract the tooth for you right away.
52	B: it's for our restaurant, not for sale. you're mistaken.
53	A: this one here is a trendy option. you might like it.
54	that would be delicious, thank you for offering. i look forward to trying them again.
55	A: that's a good idea, b. let's focus on reducing expenses and exploring additional sources of income.

57	i'll get back to you as soon as i have an answer from my company.
58	A: which specific section did you work in at beijing people's hospital?
59	A: i understand her prioritization of education over marriage in this economy.
60	sure, i'd be happy to help continue the conversation. here's a response to a's question: a: is she busy? b: yes, she often has a lot of work to handle as an accountant.
61	A: wow, a postman then. that's quite unexpected.
62	B: i believe my skills and experience can contribute to the company's growth and the value of your stocks.
63	A: i enjoy playing soccer.
64	A: classical huh? which composers do you prefer?
65	B: i see, that's why we need to save up.
66	B: communication and understanding are key. show appreciation and love consistently.
67	A: i agree, it was quite intense. i understand your concern.
68	A: no, just the pounds to dollars conversion.
69	B: thank you, i appreciate your kind words.
70	A: that sounds like a fun shopping trip! let me finish organizing my closet first.
71	A: thank you, mr. bates. your keys for room 1910 and a bellhop have been arranged for your luggage. enjoy your stay.
72	B: we regret the damage and will consider your claim for indemnification. please provide us with additional documentation to process the claim.
73	A: i agree, good health is important. focus on balance, steven. your money management skills can help you achieve financial stability, but don't forget to prioritize your health.
74	A: i understand, but they might not last much longer. consider investing in a new pair for durability.
75	A: i prefer collecting amenities from different hotels instead.
76	A: that's great to hear, enjoy the memories!
77	that's an interesting approach, a. i'll consider giving it a try. thank you for the suggestion.
78	A: fine, i will not interfere then.
79	B: sounds good, i'll meet you there.
80	B: indeed, a significant scientific advancement.
81	A: i'd be happy to accompany you, but if you prefer to go alone, the process is straightforward.
82	A: you're welcome, have a nice trip.
83	A: great! i'm sure you'll find some good deals on ties as well.
84	A: i'll find a black, leather bag then.
85	i understand your concern, but i did it unintentionally. i won't do it again.
86	B: i might consider the soccer club then.
87	A: thank you for the directions and the address. i appreciate it. b: you're welcome. have a great time at the mall!

90	B: certainly, i'll arrange for someone to help you with that.
91	A: i see. i'll consider it. thank you for the information.
92	B: different from the movie, but just as surprising. you should check it out.
93	B: i'll think about it, thanks for the invitation, a.
94	B: oh, i see. i hadn't heard that unfortunately.
95	A: i'm happy to hear that you're making progress at your new job, jill. keep me updated on any promotions or opportunities that come up.
96	that's true, bill. english does have fewer characters compared to chinese. but chinese has its unique advantages, such as its rich cultural background.
97	A: i'll ensure accuracy, mr. b.
98	great, mr. sandals. your stay in room 507 has been confirmed. enjoy your trip.
99	A: that's right. our modern lives are full of stressors, but remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. many people experience similar stress, and there are ways to manage it effectively. would you like to talk about some coping strategies?
100	sure, i'd be happy to have another glass, a. cheers!
101	B: that's fascinating. i didn't know that about cacti. the desert adaptation of those plants is truly remarkable.
102	A: i understand your position, but we're looking for a more competitive price.
103	A: i see. any publications related to your sales achievements or industry expertise?
104	that's useful, i'll keep that in mind.
105	A: very good choices, sir. your order will be ready soon. is there anything else i can add to make your meal more enjoyable?
106	it's important to prioritize safety first. do not attempt to put out the fire yourself if it is larger or spreading quickly. focus on raising the alarm and evacuating the area. let the professionals handle the fire fighting.
107	A: absolutely, reputable job websites use encryption and other security measures to protect user information.
108	A: understood. i'll wait for the figures then.
109	B: no, it's included in their standard contract.
110	B: i understand, it's a tough decision.
111	i'll be ready and waiting at 7:30. looking forward to it.
112	A: i agree, the drought is exacerbated by environmental issues. your description of the western lands matches the current scenario sadly.
113	absolutely, a testament to their resilience and self-reliance.
114	A: i can only imagine. good experience for your future career.
115	A: i haven't asked, but i know a few people who have also received invites.
116	B: that's interesting, a. maybe it's made of a hydrophilic material.
117	B: i'd rather have something more appealing, like a big mac.
118	A: no, that's clear, i can find it from here. thank you for your help.
119	A: thank you for your bold stance.
120	B: that sounds more like it! let's discuss the details and arrangements for that tour.
121	great, paul, a table for two at 8pm for non-smoking section is reserved under your name. looking forward to having you dine with us.
122	B: next week works for me. please let me know which day suits you best.
123	B: it was just infatuation, nothing serious.
124	B: that's an excellent deal. i'll take them.
125	A: thank you, i will do that. (or) i'll be ready then.
126	A: i must have misunderstood then. let's focus on the electrician's absence.
127	A: i can only imagine. it sounds like an unforgettable experience.
128	A: i see. well, i'm sure your speech will be memorable for them. (b's attendance at a's funeral is assumed in the next conversation.) a: at my funeral, i'll need you to give a pep talk to keep everyone going. b: absolutely, i'd be happy to.
129	A: i'll give it a try, but i might need some practice first. let's go get something to eat first.
130	A: yes, i do.
131	A: i see. you're living at the office? that's unconventional.
132	A: i understand. let's discuss the specific instances when overtime may be required and how we can manage it effectively.
133	i have some medicine for airsickness in the first aid kit. here you go.
134	thank you for sharing your experiences and insights, b. i'll definitely take both options into consideration.
135	B: my weak points would be my sometimes impulsive decision-making and my tendency to take on too many responsibilities at once, which may lead to burnout. i also need to work on improving my listening skills and being more patient with people at times.
136	A: thank you, mr. and mrs. ryefield. your confirmation number is 7576385. goodbye.
137	A: i'll look into opening a letter of credit in yen with one of those banks. thank you for the information.
138	you can find the questionnaire on their website, "a friend in new york," and complete it online.
139	yes, the no. 7 bus goes to lakeside park.
140	A: a cold beer would hit the spot, thanks.
141	sure, i can gift-wrap them for you.
142	A: be careful on the roads, those unexpected situations can lead to unnecessary damage.
143	i see. we have different preferences. let's focus on our individual routines then.
144	A: i'm not joking, son. the rules are in place for a reason. you need to learn responsibility and respect the curfew.
145	B: it's not necessary, the tablecloth can be replaced.
146	A: i'll go check, thanks.
147	A: i'll go get the prescription medicine then. goodbye for now.
148	B: yes, it can be a challenging process.
149	A: i've made my selection and entered the amount. now i wait for the transaction to complete and receive my cash.
150	B: you're welcome, a. enjoy your new seat.
151	A: great, i'll trust you with that. when and where should we meet up to go shopping?
152	A: understood, i'll arrange for you to see our traditional chinese medicine practitioner. please have a seat and fill out the registration form while i get the details arranged.
153	A: maybe there's a romantic thriller then?
154	B: i see. that's disappointing.
155	yes, we won, a. it was an exciting game.
156	A: perfect, i'll make sure to get ice and sodas. let's not forget about veggies for the kebabs and a salad for side dish.
157	A: i understand your concern, but try to keep in mind that children often express their thoughts freely, which might come across as back talk.
158	B: i enjoy those flavors as well.
159	i'll go get the key for you to check the interior of the kenmore refrigerator.
160	A: how much do they pay you?
161	A: yes, that's the procedure.
162	A: i'm sorry, i'll speak up. the interview is scheduled for tomorrow at 2 pm.
163	that's a good strategy, a. i'll join you in waiting for bigger discounts.
164	A: maybe we can help him look for better job opportunities.
165	here's a pen for you to fill out the lost property report. good luck, and please let me know if there's anything else i can do to help.
166	A: appreciated, thank you.
167	B: i can see how you would appreciate the effort put into the design. however, some might find it overwhelming.
168	i'd be glad to start on monday, next week.
169	A: thank you, shone. i'll make the announcement for you and jesse. we'll start searching for you both right away.
170	A: that's great to hear. we're looking forward to the project launch.
171	i was on a business trip out of the country.
172	A: i see. understood. let me know the fare when we reach the financial street.
173	i see. i'll look for an advertising and public relations agent based in britain for your consideration.
174	B: marriage can be challenging, but it's worth the effort for the love and commitment it brings.
175	A: i understand, it's popular despite being a time-waster for some.
176	A: thank you, i'll bring them over when you're ready to wash them.
177	A: that's the price.
178	A: i'm sorry, i still haven't heard of him. is he a new acquaintance?
179	A: i see. rugby is popular in your country as well.
180	vicky: maybe you could try a blouse and a skirt or a dress that's between formal and casual? that way, you'll look polished but still comfortable.
181	A: your order has been noted. enjoy your meal, goodbye. (hangs up)
182	yes, it can get quite cold in boston during winter.
183	B: consider taking a map and geography course designed for non-majors to strengthen your foundation in the subject.
184	A: here's the extra 20 yuan for the ticket.
185	i like action and adventure films. they keep me engaged and entertained.
186	A: i agree, it takes commitment.
187	B: then it might have been someone else, perhaps jennifer?
188	B: we're currently looking for options. wishing you both the best with your new home.
189	here are three eighty-five cent stamps for a total of three dollars and forty cents, please, ma'am.
190	B: i'm afraid only paying the fine will not clear your record. you may need to address any associated penalties or legal requirements depending on your jurisdiction.
191	i'll be happy to seat mr. wu at the center table as well. let me arrange that for you.
192	yes, that's correct. consistent practice is essential forlanguage learning progress.
193	A: it seems so, b. unfortunately.
194	yes, i speak japanese fluently in addition to english.
195	i'll prepare that for you right away.
196	A: i'll buy it for you tomorrow, i promise.
197	B: that's a good plan. make sure the installments fit your budget.
198	yes, you can use the onboard phone during the flight.
199	A: i'll give it a try. thanks for your help.
200	sure thing, a. i'll make arrangements for us to meet and discuss the payroll.
201	it took me about six months to get my driver's license.
202	A: okay, thank you. i'll go to the next counter to buy my ticket.
203	A: that will be 150 yuan for the bittersweet perfume, miss.
204	A: i believe mitch was providing constructive feedback. improve initiative and creativity.
205	B: of course, i'd be happy to mail your letter for you.
206	B: i'd love to see more details, can you show me some pictures or the location?
207	yes, you can fill it out now.
208	A: that was a lovely memory. i'm looking forward to making new ones in august.
209	the conversation between a and b continues as follows: a: that's great. when are you starting your trip to malaysia for the project? b: i leave in a week.
210	A: no, that will be all for now. have a good day, b.
211	B: i will take it as an opportunity to learn new skills and expand my experience.
212	B: i've been good, thanks for asking. how about you, a?
213	A: i'll use a credit card then.
214	A: london in europe is highly recommended for its charm.
215	yes, you've reached dean lee's office building. the office is on the third floor.
216	A: you may feel awake now, but getting enough rest is important. go to bed anyway.
217	A: i understand, go ahead.
218	A: sure, let's give it a try.
219	A: sounds great, let's go!
220	perhaps it's a sign of deep concentration, b.
221	that's quite a reaction from matt! must have given you quite a surprise.
222	B: pleased to meet you, john. how can i assist you as a new student?
223	A: i've always had a knack for it. let's enjoy the dance.
224	A: i agree, her beauty is truly exceptional.
225	great news, a! congratulations on passing your driving test.
226	B: traffic can be unpredictable, it's better to be prepared.
227	absolutely, it's wonderful to see your employer's support for your education and growth.
228	A: i have a family get-together to attend.
229	i understand the challenge ahead, but i'm determined to put in the effort.
230	B: i'll provide a quote after you've chosen the cloth.
231	i see, sir. i apologize for the inconvenience. could you please provide your order number and the model of the computer for further assistance? we'll make it right.
232	yes, roses are very beautiful. i can help you choose and arrange as many as you'd like.
233	it's unfortunate that the truth wasn't well-received, but focusing on the past won't help. moving forward is important.
234	A: let's find those missing receipts to account for the difference.
235	based on your recent statements, you have a strong proficiency in office work, including typewriting and shorthand abilities at impressive speeds. your skill in gathering and summarizing information shows your potential for market analysis. additionally, you have experience in using these skills to contribute effectively in an office setting.
236	A: i'll check if we have a size between small and large for you.
237	A: she's 28 years old.
238	A: yes, i am, jim. nice to meet you.
239	B: i see. that could be the cause. have you sought medical attention for the head injury?
240	A: it's a classic romantic film set in the american south during the civil war.
241	B: understood, see you later a.
242	B: it depends on the specific area and resources available. some rural schools provide excellent education, while others may have challenges.
243	B: i'm not sure when robert will be back, you could try calling later.
244	B: some people believe so, but it's largely a matter of faith and personal experience.
245	A: great choice! i'll place the order.
246	yes, we have vip rooms. would you like to reserve one for your party?
247	A: we'll consider that for future fundraisers, for now, donations through door-to-door are our focus.
248	A: your ticket is confirmed, mr. black. please arrive at the airport one hour before departure.
249	B: i'll definitely keep that in mind. thanks for the suggestion, a.
250	A: understood, we'll also check your cholesterol levels in the blood test.
251	B: i understand, thank you for the reminder. perhaps i can find time for that in the future.
252	yes, i have attempted to quit on several occasions. but it's not been easy.
253	A: i see, maturing brings about changes both inside and out.
254	A: yes, i did. i had to undergo a medical examination as part of the application process.
255	A: of course, here you are. one more thing, ketchup is on the table. enjoy your meal.
256	B: i'm happy to share more, a. i worked long hours and saved every penny to learn english. i attended language classes and worked hard to improve. eventually, i started a small business and took risks, even facing some failures along the way. persistence and determination were key.
257	A: i understand. i will focus on building a strong foundation of trust and communication with her.
258	A: i've got some tips for you as well, tony. be attentive to your customers' needs and make sure their orders are filled promptly. also, learn the menu by heart and be knowledgeable about the food and drinks you serve. good luck with your interview tomorrow!
259	A: i respect your decision, but why not try to find a role that utilizes your abilities within your current job instead?
260	A: i'll contact you if your cpa certificate is ready by the end of july. good luck with your certification.
261	B: no, that's in my local time. phoenix is in the mountain time zone, so you would need to subtract an hour from that arrival time if you're in the eastern time zone.
262	A: i'll consider joining a dance class then, it sounds enjoyable.
263	A: i'm glad to hear that. books can open up new worlds and broaden our perspectives.
264	A: 6 pm works for me. i'll see you then.
265	B: i think he's bringing some positive changes to the city.
266	A: we also provide regular pest control services throughout the building.
267	that would be wonderful, a. i can't wait to take a dip.
268	B: i'm committed and focused on my work, always eager to learn and improve.
269	A: one person, got it. i'll make the reservation for may 3rd for one person.
270	i understand your feelings about working on weekends. it can be draining. i'm glad you were able to verify the accuracy of the documents and that your boss was supportive of your efforts. try to get some rest now, you deserve it.
271	A: i'll consider your suggestion. good night, b.
272	A: i might if i'm running late. you'd better hurry up.
273	B: mangoes originate from tropical regions like india, mexico, and thailand.
274	A: i'll place an order for 10,000 pieces at 115 yuan per piece.
275	B: have you considered trying a rideshare service instead? it might be more affordable than a taxi.
276	sure, i'd be happy to help out with that. let me know the details.
277	B: i'm studying computer science. how about you?
278	A: we can still use the subway tickets for another day, frida. let's explore san francisco in a more exciting way.
279	yes, you do have rights, but you were supposedly aware of the court date and failed to appear. this is why a warrant was issued for your arrest.
280	yes, you can get off here for wangfujing.
281	B: okay, andy, i'll call for help then.
282	A: the great wall was built during the han dynasty, around 200 bc. i'm glad you enjoy chinese tea.
283	B: they may respond as soon as tomorrow, but it could also take several days.
284	B: (laughs) i promise i won't! let's enjoy the night together.
285	A: i'm here if you need anything else. get well soon.
286	A: i'm sorry, but the apartment doesn't allow pets.
287	A: a picnic with friends sounds nice, but a home party could also be fun. maybe we could do both?
288	i've taken care of it. you're an amazing host, a. the party was a success thanks to you.
289	A: i've got you this year, b!
290	yes, please have a seat while you wait, steve.
291	B: sad but true, they're getting more sophisticated.
292	A: impressive craftsmanship for that price.
293	sure, here you go. i'll swipe your room card to add the charge to your hotel bill.
294	A: thank you, sir. have a great day. (or: that's taken care of.)
295	A: i'm glad you'll enjoy it then.
296	B: yes, i have, but his productivity during those hours isn't impressive.
297	B: alright then, i trust you'll take good care of your new pet. congratulations!
298	A: i see. i'm happy for you both and your important commitments.
299	that's commendable of her, making such significant lifestyle changes for the health of the baby.
300	i'll take you to the station, madam. please get in the taxi.
301	i understand, a. your friend's address is near the manhattan post office?
302	B: i see. well, i'll give her another chance then.
303	A: yes, please come at 2 pm on tuesday.
304	A: i hope so, it would be great to enjoy all the summer activities again.
305	B: i'll park here, you grab the books.
306	great, please let me know when the technician is expected to arrive. i will make sure to be home then.
307	A: you're welcome, goodbye, mr. john.
308	B: i look forward to it. bye. (b expresses excitement and confirms attendance, setting a farewell tone.)
309	A: i know, but the savings can be significant.
310	A: that's a valid point. religion can indeed be a source of conflict. but not all believers behave badly, and some find great comfort and meaning in their faith. it's a complex issue with no easy answers.

317	A: what is that thing she's not good at, b? b: cooking. she can't cook worth a dime. a: i see. well, everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. b: absolutely, a. but katherine more than makes up for it with her language skills and athleticism.
318	A: thanks for offering the chairs, b. i'll give you the address later.
319	A: yeah, i just need to use the restroom. we can make a quick stop at the next exit.

335	perhaps, but his brilliance often overshadows any absences.
336	A: excellent, it sounds like the apartment is well-equipped and functional. let's make the move.
337	it's a tough choice you have there. both oxford university and yale university have excellent reputations. the decision might depend on your priorities such as cost of living, career goals, and personal preferences. good luck with your decision!
338	A: i understand, but it's important to prioritize your job. good luck with your apology.

368	A: no, the looters have not been identified yet.
369	A: i had no idea. thank you for letting me know.

571	A: i see. well, you have myself and the officers at the scene to testify to your speed, and using a cell phone while driving is against the law here. let me see if i can find a place for you to park while i run a few checks.
572	A: i'm sorry for your troubles, but i cannot condone your choices.

880	A: thank you for the offer, but i've made other arrangements for transportation. i'll see you later, b. b: okay, take care and good luck on your exam!
881	A: yes, i did.
882	there may be fines for late returns, but it varies. check with the library for the specific fine amount.
883	A: that must be why it's popular then.
884	A: great, i'll see you on saturday then. looking forward to the coffee after the show.
885	B: of course. for instance, if you're looking for a book written by marshall mcluhan, you would look under 'm' in the card catalog.
886	B: it might be helpful to speak with a healthcare professional about your feelings.
887	A: that's a significant discount if buying in large quantities. let's consider it.
888	A: she's 27 years old.
889	i understand your frustration, but there seems to be no immediate solution to the temperature issue. perhaps bringing some extra blankets or wearing warmer clothing could help you stay comfortable in the meantime.
890	A: that must have been quite the experience. were you able to eventually stop?
891	i will arrange for a maid to clean your room immediately.
892	A:got it, house red it is for both of us.
893	A: i'll collect the sales letters and the copied report on transparency paper, thank you.
894	B: it would be competitive and commensurate with my skills and experience.
895	A: i'd be happy to help you take more pictures.
896	A: i see. it's a difficult situation. you might want to talk to him about how you feel and see if there's a way to handle the gossip and the distance between you two.
897	A: i hadn't known about the rental library. it might be worth checking out.
898	B: yes, i do.
899	A: absolutely, bring as many films as you need for the picnic.
900	A: yes, we offer tax-free purchases for certain items. please proceed to the tax-free counter with your selected bottles to complete your purchase.
901	A: yes, it is. let's go to the conference room now.
902	A: was the vacation especially tiring, victoria?
903	A: i see, well, let me know if you change your plans and we'll go skating then. b: sure, will do. but for now, it's time to focus on our cleaning.
904	A: i'm glad to hear that, henry. we'll be in touch regarding next steps. congratulations on getting the job.
905	yes, i enjoy doing aerobics as a hobby.
906	A: thank you for the information. i'll take the 264 from altadena drive to the gold line station.
907	B: i'm not here to discuss my personal life with you, a. let's focus on the business at hand.
908	A: five dollars is the minimum deposit? alright, i will deposit that amount.
909	B: i had no idea. well, i wish them happiness then.
910	thank you, a. i appreciate the compliment. cycling is a sustainable mode of transportation that reduces my carbon footprint and helps me stay active.
911	A: it seems your stocks may experience significant losses if you don't sell now.
912	A: i'm glad your colleague was released safely. but terrorist attacks are not random acts of violence, they have specific goals and giving in to them only fuels their aggression. we need to stand strong against such acts.
913	A: please show me the book for verification.
914	A: i'll go get it.
915	B: i see, it seems there's a distance between you two.
916	B: i see. we'll need to regroup and come up with new plans then.
917	B: you'll receive instructions on next steps, typically including an interview with an employment counselor.
918	B: i'm glad to hear about your financial success, a. just be sure to take care of your health while working hard to save for the car.
919	B: that's a good idea. let's go find the policeman.
920	A: yes, i can step outside to smoke.
921	i guess it's up to you then.
922	A: that's good to know. i'll come by before 2 pm then.
923	agreed, we need to tailor our promotional content accordingly to resonate with each audience effectively. adjusting our messaging and product offerings for boston's and chicago's demographic differences can lead to better engagement and sales.
924	A: great, looking forward to meeting you then, vanessa.
925	A: i will keep that in mind, thank you. goodnight, b.
926	A: here you go, the bill is 68 pounds.

932	A: that's quite a coincidence.
933	you're welcome, have a great shopping experience! (b)
934	that's very kind of you, terry. i'll keep that in mind.
935	A: thank you, i'll do that.
936	i'll be ready at six thirty then. looking forward to the concert.

939	A: i'll be waiting for the call on thursday. bye for now.
940	you're welcome, a. i'm glad i could help you find some affordable cashmere sweaters. outlets are great for scoring deals on high-end items. good luck with your shopping!
941	A: thank you, i will.
942	A: i'm sorry, i seem to have forgotten. you studied economics at harvard.
943	i understand your decision and wish you the best in your job search. it's important to be compensated fairly for your skills and experience. good luck in finding a new opportunity.
944	A: tian'anmen square is the next to last stop. please move on to find a seat.
945	A: that's all he wrote in the card, according to you, janey.
946	i'm doing well, thanks for asking. it's good to hear that you had a productive week with your uncle. is accounting something you might be interested in pursuing?
947	i'll try my best to get you there as quickly as possible, but i cannot go faster than the speed limit, sir.
948	that's a wonderful offer! we'll take an additional appetizer as well, thank you.
949	A: no problem, glad i can help. let's get going to beijing university.
950	A: i'll be ready when the taxi arrives.
951	A: it seems risky to hold onto them.
952	A: wow, that's serious. i'm glad you were there to help.
953	sure, i'd be happy to lend it to you once i'm done.
954	A: i'm sure you'll make it, you always do. just hydrate and rest up before then.

959	B: of course, take your time.
960	B: yes, we have a trainer available for an additional fee. you can make an appointment at the front desk.
961	A: i understand, b. i'll prioritize my needs for now. thank you for your concern.
962	A: you're missing out on the full experience, but if you're not interested, that's fine. i'll be back soon to share the results with you.
963	B: you could start by preparing responses for common interview questions and practicing them. also, consider researching the interviewer and the company culture to tailor your responses appropriately.
964	A: and a contact number, michael, for confirmation purposes?
965	i will in a moment. thanks for the suggestion.
966	A: i'm not trying to compete with the stars, but maybe i should update my wardrobe too. b: absolutely, a. sometimes a new outfit can make all the difference.
967	A: i'll be careful this time. thanks, mark.
968	i see, it's important to you to ensure authenticity when making such a significant purchase.

971	seven o'clock works for me. see you then.
972	A: that's correct. and in the event of loss or theft, you should report it to the local police and contact us as soon as possible to file a claim. we'll make the process as smooth as possible for you.
973	i see. in that case, it might be around 2:40 on your watch based on my observation.
974	A: we'll need to call a termite specialist for that. let's focus on eliminating the cockroaches first. i'll bring the necessary spray for that.
975	yes, that's correct. the "happy birthday" song as we know it today has its roots in "good morning to you" and has been widely used since the early 20th century.
976	the guest may be invited for a longer stay or for another round of conversation.
977	A: understood, i'll have the pork cutlet instead.
978	B: yes, i've noticed that as well. it can be quite confusing at times.
979	A: i will send those documents by next wednesday as requested. thank you.
980	sure thing, i'll add it to your room charge.
981	A: i meant when would you like the whisky and soda served, sir. (pours whisky into glass)
982	B: that's correct in many cases, but not all private schools require uniforms. it's important to research specific schools for their unique features.
983	A: i can't wait to decorate it for the party.
984	A: yes, i'm assuming you checked that before coming here. let's try jump-starting the car first. do you have jumper cables?

986	A: sure, i'll arrange for becker to assist you. let's make sure we meet our deadline.

989	great, i'll meet you at the car.
990	i understand your struggle, but i'm concerned about the impact of secondhand smoke on our health and the new restrictions on smoking in public places. maybe trying other methods or seeking support from a professional could help you quit more effectively?
991	A: i suggest we prioritize completing the project on time. let's regroup and call you back once the connection stabilizes.
992	A: i didn't mean to imply that, b. apologies if it came across that way. enjoy the rest of your meal, and good luck with your diet.
993	i'd enjoy that, it sounds like a great experience.
994	A: i understand. i'll make sure to save you a spot if you change your mind.
995	sure, i'd be happy to show you the room when it's convenient for you.
996	A: sure, i'd be happy to take a look.

1009	the classic lasagna, please.
1010	A: no, i don't have a daughter. just focus on the game.
1011	no, that's all for now. if you have any other questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to ask.
1012	A: i'm only trying to help prevent an accident. b: your constant shouting is more distracting than anything else.
1013	A: i'll prepare the contract for you to sign. please make sure to read it thoroughly before affixing your signatures and providing the required information.
1014	B: yes, there can be issues with delivery times, hidden fees, and security concerns when shopping online. it's important to do your research and protect your personal information.
1015	A: i'll go speak with the director then. thank you for your help.
1016	i'll hold.
1017	A: the receipt is necessary for a warranty claim.

1027	B: thanks, a, i try to be productive and efficient.
1028	A: i appreciate your encouragement. thank you.
1029	A: i'm glad you see it that way. regular maintenance can save you from costly repairs in the future. let's get started with the tune up.

1039	B: hongtao is red tower, leitao is black tower, meihua is plum blossom, and fangpian is square bun. (these are names of cards in some chinese card games.)

1050	A: yes, that should do the trick for your headache. i'll write the prescription for both the flu medication and the pain reliever. feel better soon.
1051	it's common for couples to write their own vows nowadays, and instead of rice, some use birdseed to avoid harming the birds. exciting, isn't it? let's head over and see who catches the bouquet.
1052	that sounds like an enjoyable experience. i'd be happy to help you prepare for your camping trip instead. let me know if you need any advice on gear or supplies.
1053	A: you're welcome. bye for now.
1054	A: i can look for landlords open to such arrangements.

1067	A: three days works for me. i look forward to the fitting.

1069	A: in three days, so returning tomorrow evening.
1070	A: what percentage would that be for a refund? b: it depends on the airline's refund policy. generally, it's around 25% of the ticket price for domestic flights and up to 50% for international flights. but check with the airline directly for the most accurate information.

1079	A: absolutely, personality and qualifications play a bigger role in the interview process.
1080	the bus departs every 15 minutes, and the journey should take around 30 minutes. enjoy your visit to the british museum! (assuming a is agreeable to taking the bus and wants to know more details)
1081	A: it went well, i believe. the interviewer seemed friendly and asked thoughtful questions. i'm optimistic about the outcome.
1082	we'll provide you with a detailed quote based on the specified quantity. look forward to our offer by next wednesday.

1085	A: that's perfect, b. let me give them a call to confirm the message.
1086	A: yes, bearer certificates are different. they don't require a receipt as the holder is considered the owner. the minimum purchase is 5,000 rib and have no maximum limit.

1089	A: i'm relieved to hear that. let's hope she continues to excel.
1090	A: yes, that's the one.
1091	B: i see. i'm sorry to hear that.
1092	it's a prestigious university known for its academic excellence.
1093	A: fair enough, i'll meet you at the gate. (note: the conversation seems to be light-hearted and playful in nature, and a seems to tease b about her shopping habits.)
1094	B: i see. poplar trees, not ginkgoes here.
1095	A: i'd be happy to introduce you to some of them.
1096	i'd be happy to provide you with a fragile label. here it is. (insert image of fragile label or hand one over.)
1097	B: thank you, i appreciate that. i'm actually an avid weightlifter.
1098	A: that's a good idea for your brother. i'll stick with the jade bear for my mother.
1099	A: absolutely, feel free to take notes.
1100	B: that sounds very efficient and convenient.
1101	it's up to you, but many people prefer to list work experience and education first to highlight relevant qualifications. interests and affiliations can be included in a separate section if there's space and they add value to your application.
1102	A: that's great, b. pursuing a new career can be exciting. good luck with your teaching plans!
1103	great, i'll hop in the car and we can head out together.
1104	A: yes, please, i'll take any coins you have for a call.
1105	B: the installment plan might be a more feasible option for you then. you should consider the total cost of the installments and your long-term budget.
1106	B: i understand and i'll be sad to see you go. i'll do my best to help you with the reference you need. good luck in your new endeavor.
1107	i'll do my best to accommodate your request, sir. i'll look for a table by the bay windows overlooking the wharf for you.
1108	approximately half of our workforce falls into the laboring category.
1109	A: the divided skirt could be a good option for you then. it's a classic and versatile style.
1110	A: i'll go then, but i'm curious now more than ever.
1111	A: i completely understand, mrs. smith. your concern speaks volumes about your love for them.
1112	i'm glad to hear that! it's a significant milestone to exercise your right to vote for the first time, especially during an election year.
1113	indeed, a significant historical site with a tragic past. let us pay our respects and learn more about it at jingshan park.
1114	great, you'll find it just a short walk and a turn to the left. and no need to worry about duties as it's a duty-free shop.
1115	A: that's right, b. the combination of plum blossoms and snow creates a magical atmosphere.
1116	B: it's going well, thanks for asking. how about you, a?
1117	it's possible to see some weight loss with a healthy and consistent diet and exercise, but losing 20 pounds in 4 weeks is not realistic or healthy. it's recommended to aim for a slow and steady weight loss of about 1-2 pounds per week.
1118	i see. harvard it is then. i've been in the states for nearly four years myself.
1119	that's a great idea, a. let's find the museum guide.
1120	A: appreciate your assistance. (or) thank you for checking. (or) much obliged. (or) i'm grateful for your help. (or) you've been a great help. (or) iâm thankful for your support. (or) many thanks. (or) i owe you one. (or) i'm in your debt. (pick one based on the tone you want to convey.)
1121	A: that's a valid question. ask him about his qualifications before hearing about his secret.
1122	B: the post office is located on fifth avenue.
1123	great, the pool it is then.
1124	i'll make sure to be there for the reception then.
1125	yes, he's improving.
1126	A: before the meals, with a full glass of water.
1127	B: i'll graciously accept it, but i appreciate the gesture.
1128	B: i'll prove myself to your boss then. i won't give up easily.
1129	i see, his behavior has remained consistent since then.
1130	that's the right attitude, a. keep practicing daily and trust the process. good luck with your handwriting improvement!
1131	A: i'd be happy to meet mr. johnson then. let's go introduce ourselves.
1132	B: i assure you, it was unintentional.
1133	A: i'll adjust the settings before we go. let's try again at the falls.
1134	i'd be happy to attend the neighbor's party. thank you for the invitation, shirley.
1135	A: i'll check it out, thanks for the suggestion.
1136	A: of course, we can provide you with additional information for your consultation with your boss.
1137	you should bring multiple copies of your resume and any required application forms.

1139	A: yes, our mechanics are trained to handle major repairs as well.
1140	A: feel free to take your time and consider your options. i'm here if you have any more questions.
1141	A: that's great news for you as well! congratulations on the raise and bonus.
1142	that's great to hear. i'd be excited about the opportunity to potentially work overseas in the future.
1143	A: i'll give you three more minutes. after that, it's time to get up.
1144	B: i'm just having fun, and it's all in good spirit, tom. plus, some people don't have kids of their own to take trick-or-treating.
1145	A: yes, we do have chinese food options on the menu.
1146	A: this pair is in brown and might be what you're looking for.
1147	maybe we could use a translation tool for better understanding.
1148	A: i'm glad you found my knowledge impressive. there's more to learn about the modern olympic games, though. when were they first held again?
1149	thank you for your dedication and hard work, b. i'm glad to hear that you've been meeting our goals and adapting well to the new job. keep up the good work.
1150	A: got it, a man around five-nine to five-ten, medium build, dark hair that's straight and of average length, wearing a numbered jacket or a plaid shirt, dark pants, and hiking boots. thanks for the description.
1151	A: i see, thank you for letting me know.
1152	A: of course, sir. your check and your dessert will be right over.
1153	B: i'd be happy to, carol. it seems even geniuses are struggling with this software.
1154	A: great, i'd be happy to make a reservation for a single night with included meals for $50.
1155	B: i'm doing my best, a. let's focus on improving the process instead of rushing and making mistakes.
1156	A: single prices vary, but return fares are around Â£60.
1157	A: that's alright, b. you can speak on any topic of your choice. just make it clear and coherent.
1158	B: i appreciate that, a. your thoughtfulness means a lot.
1159	A: i see. that's serious. let's report it to the authorities and contact the embassy to secure a new passport as soon as possible.
1160	A: i'm sorry, i didn't realize that. we could try adjusting it to your left hand.
1161	A: i'll take it. (or) that's a fair price.
1162	A: i appreciate your help, b. have a great day!
1163	i'll make sure to arrive around six thirty, a. looking forward to it.
1164	i'll get you the sales letters and file the report on transparency paper.
1165	thank you for your kind words, a. i'm excited about the new opportunity and ready to tackle the challenges that come with it.
1166	A: thank you, i'll get them. b: you're welcome.
1167	B: that's a narrow-minded perspective. not all online relationships are based on sex or sexuality.
1168	A: i'll understand if you're busy. let me know when you're free instead.
1169	you can reach yellowstone national park by car or guided tour. the park is located in wyoming, montana, and idaho in the united states. you may want to check the official park website or travel agencies for transportation options and details on how to get there.
1170	A: i'll consider your offer, but i'd rather try to keep my job if possible. i'll also explore other options, like finding a part-time job or temporary work.
1171	A: that's true. it's convenient to have your photos easily accessible. b: yes, absolutely. it saves me time and effort.
1172	B: it's a slippery slope for some, a. even if you weren't negatively affected, not everyone is that lucky.
1173	A: check-in opens 24 hours prior to flight departure for online, and 3 hours before for the airport counter.
1174	A: i'm sorry to hear that about your step-brother's family. it's nice to see how your mom and step-dad came together as a family despite the circumstances.
1175	A: alright, you win this time. let's go see the love story and find a place with meat options for dinner.
1176	i suggest an alternative route.
1177	A: thank you for your help, b. i think i can find the hilton hotel now.
1178	A: unfortunate setback, try to stay committed this time.
1179	B: impressive speed!
1180	B: the position requires extensive experience in a specific field that you don't have.
1181	A: thank you, i will. please let me know if there are any side effects i should watch out for.
1182	yes, i'll see you at 2:30 this afternoon to fix your washing machine.
1183	thank you for the invitation, rose. i'll make sure to attend your fashion show next month.
1184	B: have you considered other fields related to english literature that might offer better job prospects with advanced degrees?
1185	B: absolutely, i've always wanted to explore different cultures and see new places.
1186	A: thank you, i enjoyed our conversation as well.
1187	understood, i'll make the adjustment to your wake-up calls and will be available if you have any further requests.
1188	A: my car is no problem. see you tomorrow. good night, b.
1189	B: i'll give it a try then, thank you.
1190	A: it's spelt m-c-d-o-n-a-l-d.
1191	B: did he explain how he knew you?
1192	A: apologies, i'll lower the volume.
1193	i'll make a list: pens, clips, erasers, sticky notes.
1194	B: for me, i guess. why do you ask?
1195	B: hi john, yes, your car is ready for pick-up. please come by the shop during business hours to sign the paperwork and pay the invoice.
1196	yes, i sometimes got leftover pizza as a perk. how about you, any benefits from your part-time job?
1197	A: that's great to hear, linda. good luck with your continued growth in the company.
1198	A: i understand, everyone has different reasons for pursuing things. for you, english study brings satisfaction, but it may not be the same for me.
1199	i'd love to experience that with you. let's make it happen.
1200	B: to the movie theater.
1201	B: i'm sorry for that, madam. another option you might consider is theiei brand's freckle caring essence. it's more affordable at 299 yuan.
1202	A: you're welcome. have a nice day.
1203	that sounds delightful, a. i look forward to trying your mutton chops again.
1204	i understand, but her intentions might be good despite her persistent nature.
1205	i'll need to know the length of your stay to provide an accurate quote for your room. could you please specify the number of nights?
1206	you're welcome! i'm sure you'll both have a wonderful time at disneyworld. enjoy your honeymoon planning.
1207	A: i agree, we'll miss them. but we'll still have a nice dinner with the six of us.
1208	A: no, the identity of the looters is still unknown.
1209	i often read or take a nap in the afternoon, or go for a walk. sometimes i meet with friends for lunch or tea.
1210	A: yes, it's paul. hello, paul. how may i assist you today?
1211	A: i understand your perspective, but let's focus on enjoying the day and not turn it into a lecture.
1212	great choices! i'll make sure to include those treatments in your half-day package.
1213	you're welcome, a. enjoy your chip shopping!
1214	A: i'm sorry, the new copies will be available next week.
1215	i agree, the traffic and noise are quite overwhelming today.
1216	A: agreed, let's make our way back now.
1217	A: true, but there are numerous smaller islands and archipelagos dwarfed by even britain.
1218	great, i'll lead the way to the cafeteria then. let's see if they have some delicious chow mein for you.
1219	great idea, a. i'll keep an eye out for harry.
1220	that works for me, mary. i'll see you on monday at 9 a.m.
1221	i'll arrange for emergency cash access at an iba branch for you, mr. kowalski. no need to worry.
1222	A: i'm sorry, you'll need to pay the late fees before checking out new books.
1223	A: yes, the world's geography is fascinating. b: absolutely, it's a constant reminder of the power and beauty of nature.
1224	i'll pass the news on to you and let you decide if you'd like to visit. congratulations on the new addition to the family!
1225	A: i assure you, they're real.
1226	A: great, what time should i be ready then?
1227	B: i see. it must be challenging for you.
1228	B: thank you, sir. (or, if b is a woman: thank you, sir. i'll get the door myself.)
1229	sure, i'd be happy to play tennis with you! let me know when and where we can arrange a time to play.
1230	A: that's helpful to know. i'm glad you can communicate effectively with our spanish-speaking customers.
1231	the fine amount varies, so i'd recommend checking with a bank representative for the most accurate information.
1232	A: i hope so, i'd rather be on solid ground.
1233	i will make sure to keep that in mind, doctor. thank you for the advice.
1234	i'm doing well, thanks for asking. enjoying the nice weather too.
1235	A: three perrier bottles, two jim beam bottles, apples, and grape juice. i'll place the order for you.
1236	thank you, mr. smith. your wake-up call is set for 6:30 am, and your room is located on the fifth floor, number 502. breakfast will be available from 6:30 am to 9 am. have a nice stay.
1237	A: no, i'd prefer to keep the original character of the cottage intact with some antique furnishings and decorations.
1238	B: of course, please make sure to try on the size that fits you best.
1239	you may want to consider rest, staying hydrated, and consuming light foods. if your symptoms persist or worsen, you should consult a healthcare professional.
1240	A: i'd rather not, but i'll trust you on that. please declare the cigarettes and whisky for customs.
1241	A: yes, milk please.
1242	A: i'll apply the discount for you, madam. your total amount payable is 11,170 yuan.
1243	B: each recommendation is unique and personally written by the professor, highlighting your accomplishments and skills. the specifics of your academic record and extracurricular activities are important factors in the hiring process.
1244	B: sure, i'd be happy to join you at the etv.
1245	A: i'll call you when it's your turn at the counter. please have your identification ready.
1246	B: similarly, i'm sure our paths will cross again.
1247	A: i'm glad you like it, sir. let me get you a size in the fitting room.
1248	A: i see. let's proceed to the exit then. have a nice stay in our country.
1249	A: that's correct. any dietary restrictions i should be aware of?
1250	A: ah, i see. that makes sense. b: yes, paper is the traditional first anniversary gift. maybe a beautiful book or some handwritten love letters?
1251	here's a concise response from a: "here's your receipt, sir. $26.50."
1252	A: yes, i do believe that. the scientific evidence suggests that human activities are contributing to significant climate change, which could have devastating consequences.
1253	A: i can relate, my mind's been drifting off to diesel fumes lately too. but the coffee still gives me the necessary kick.
1254	the price of grapes can vary greatly depending on the location and time of year. could i check with the vendor or look up the current market price for you?
1255	A: place the books on the checkout counter and hand over the card when prompted. the librarian will ask you for your library card number to complete the process.
1256	A: i'd be happy to check for you. let me transfer you to her extension.
1257	A: i totally understand, b. it can be difficult but communication is key. good luck with talking to your son. let me know if there's anything else i can do to help.
1258	B: that will be five pounds fifteen pence in total, sir.
1259	at a formal dinner, place the napkin on your lap after being seated and once the hostess or most distinguished guest has done so. fold it in your lap, with the crease forming a v shape or placing it to the left of your plate.
1260	B:maybe our differences make our friendship more interesting and help us grow. we can learn from each other.
1261	i understand. keep your notebook then.
1262	A: i'll buy credit at the business center, thank you.
1263	A: i'm glad you're giving it a chance. let's continue dancing.
1264	you're saying your name is noirin o'neil? i'm andrew smith.
1265	A: sounds good, mary. i look forward to it. bye.
1266	A: thank you, i will submit the form right away.
1267	A: the opening is scheduled for the 15th of next month.
1268	i'll make sure it doesn't happen again, betty.
1269	A: that's appreciated. i'll meet you at the checkout.
1270	the ending was satisfying, with some unexpected but fitting resolutions.
1271	i'll bring you the forms, please sign where indicated.
1272	thank you, benjamin, for reporting the break-in at broad-gate street 2101. officers are on the way. don't touch anything until we arrive.
1273	that's a strong observation, b. with his diligence and numerous supporters, he certainly appears to be in a advantageous position.
1274	A: the beijing wildlife sanctuary does offer a unique experience. i suggest researching it further before planning your visit.
1275	A: oh, i see. i'll give it a try then.
1276	A: i haven't made a decision yet, but mark's agreeable personality is a positive factor.
1277	A: single, thank you. b: the morning flight from london to paris in coach is at 9:30 am. is that a good time for you?
1278	B: my most positive quality is my strong work ethic and determination to excel in new challenges.
1279	B: i'm glad they got him to the hospital in time. i hope he pulls through.
1280	B: i'm not sure yet, i'll find out and get back to you.
1281	A: it's clean and easy to read.
1282	A: i'll remember the location of the bookstore for next time. thanks for the tip on selling back textbooks.
1283	B: i'm sorry, peter is currently unavailable. can i take a message?
1284	thank you, a, and enjoy your well-deserved break. i'll inform the team about your leave and your assistant taking over. have a great time and come back rejuvenated.
1285	A: i'll process your payment and send you a confirmation with the details of your booking. thank you for choosing us.
1286	A: i'd rather not go to a car dealership right now. i'll consider selling my car online or to a private buyer.
1287	A: i've considered that, but i'm afraid it could escalate the situation. maybe try ignoring her for a while or setting clear boundaries?
1288	B:that's a factor, but there are other reasons as well.
1289	A: really? mine engages us with stories. b: hers are textbook-bound and dull.
1290	B: i see. well, the price of a ten-speed-sportsman can vary. you may want to research and check for the current market price.
1291	A: the more issues dan can address in one visit, the better. i'll suggest the gutter issue too.
1292	A: understood, let's go to ann's house first to make the important call.
1293	A: i see, business communication was your favorite then?
1294	A: that's still not solving the issue of the unlucky number, maybe we could ask someone to back out? b: who would that be? a: let me try and reach out to one of our guests and see if they can reschedule.
1295	A: nick, from the conference on foreign investment.
1296	A: yes, i'll consider speaking with lora. thanks for the suggestion.
1297	let's go and check out those signed football photographs then. we can split the cost.
1298	B: maybe, but he showed great potential during the interview.
1299	A: okay, bye for now. (or see you later.)
1300	B: let's discuss it, dear. we'll consider your usual bedtime and any pending tasks or activities.
1301	B: i see. i'm not fond of extreme cold weather, but the natural beauty of norway is quite appealing. i'll keep that in mind for future travel plans.
1302	A: agreed, it's a positive sign for the country's economic growth.
1303	A: i see. you've only seen coco on television then.
1304	B: discipline is a skill that can be learned. consider seeking resources to help improve your budgeting and financial management.
1305	that's a valid point. working part-time can help with finances and still allow you to focus on your studies.
1306	A: then pour the batter into the waffle maker and cook.
1307	B: i'll prepare that for you. please wait a moment.
1308	A: it's my birthday.
1309	A: i see. good for him. (implies that clive having a girlfriend is a positive thing)
1310	B: it depends on your skills, interests, and career goals. what fields have you considered exploring?
1311	A: does the pain increase when you chew on that side?
1312	B: thank you, ted. we will investigate the situation in room 2012 regarding the rude behavior of the maid and address it promptly.
1313	A: i'm glad to see progress in american politics.
1314	B: i'm sorry, i didn't realize. let's find you something else to drink instead.
1315	yes, we did. we packed some sandwiches and hot tea to keep us warm.
1316	thank you, sir. i'll make sure to give the bellboy your luggage before leaving. enjoy your stay in room 1405.
1317	A: seven dollars it is. i'll make it for you right away.
1318	B: i'll try to refresh my memory before then.
1319	A: i'll meet you there. i'll get the cigarettes on my way.
1320	i believe it's approximately a 15-minute walk from here. however, for precise directions, i'd recommend using a mapping service or asking at the information desk.
1321	A: i'll try that, thanks.
1322	A: please bring two forms of identification and any relevant work experience documents.
1323	i'd be happy to recommend one of her books to you. let me look up the title of one that i particularly enjoyed and get back to you.
1324	A: a little, but the energy i get from the class keeps me going.
1325	B: that's a great deal! congrats on your wins and good luck with the camera bid.
1326	A: the processing may take a few business days after completing all formalities.
1327	A: i understand your frustration, but let's focus on finding new reservations. i'll search for options and keep you updated.
1328	A: yes, you can renew the books if you need more time. just let me know before the due date.
1329	yes, you can leave a message for mr. wang li at the reception desk.
1330	that's impressive, mr. kramer! congratulations on your business success.
1331	A: best of luck with your results then. i'm confident in your abilities.
1332	B: oh, i see. thanks for the warning, a. i think i may have run over a rock or something.
1333	A: i'll contact them as soon as i can get my number working again. apologies for any inconvenience caused.
1334	A: i'm glad to see that. keep it up!
1335	A: i'll bring the letter at the gate around seven, where peter brown is meeting us.
1336	B: i'm glad you noticed. we've been working on that.
1337	B: i'm not one to back down from a dare, a. i'll give it a try.
1338	A: i understand, thank you for the clarification.
1339	A: here's the form for you, please complete it accurately.
1340	A: that will be 3,500 yuan for the two-carat ring you've tried on.
1341	i outline the steps i need to take to complete each project or task, establish deadlines, and prioritize my work accordingly.
1342	i'll go check if dan is available and let him know you're calling.
1343	i'd probably have one or two tvs, possibly in the living room and the master bedroom.
1344	A: i understand, but please use a blanket instead.
1345	A: i'm here to help. you can try contacting the airline or hotel to arrange for a new boarding pass to be sent or for someone to bring it to the airport. alternatively, you may need to make arrangements for a new flight.
1346	A: here's the current interest rate information for your deposit: 0.8% per month.
1347	B: tannin can leach out and make the tea bitter and increase its astringency if left to steep for too long.
1348	my most positive quality is my strong work ethic and determination to succeed in new challenges.
1349	B: i'll make arrangements to extend it right away.
1350	great, i'll navigate us there then. let's go get our spicy fix at chang an street's authentic sichuan hot pot restaurant!
1351	B: i'll arrange for express delivery to japan. please provide your shipping address.
1352	i'd prefer to pay with a credit card.
1353	i encountered some unexpected traffic on the way.
1354	A: yes, a soda or water? b: i'll have a soda, please. coke if you have it.
1355	A: i'll give you 500 gbp worth of ribs. please pay the equivalent amount in the local currency.
1356	A: i understand your concerns, buttry not to dwell too much on your dreams. let's focus on the positive aspects of our work.
1357	A: you're welcome, goodbye! we'll have your luggage ready for pick-up at 9:00 and your receipt at the front desk tomorrow.
1358	A: i'll go for the ultrasound as prescribed, thank you, doctor.
1359	A: thank you, that would be appreciated. (or "thank you, i'll be more comfortable with that.")
1360	B: i'm seeking new opportunities and i believe this assistant role aligns better with my career goals. i'm eager to learn and grow in a new environment.
1361	A: really? i thought the recipes called for it to be cooked less.
1362	sure, i'd be happy to recommend a drink to accompany your sole. how about a glass of chardonnay or sauvignon blanc?
1363	A: i knew it was a full workday for you. weekends included.
1364	i also enjoy italian cuisine.
1365	A: in japan, it's often passed down through families or taught by a master, known as a sensei. students train for years to master the intricacies of the tea ceremony.
1366	A: understood. your 4 x 6 glossy prints will be ready for pick-up tomorrow afternoon. the total cost will be determined once the prints are developed.
1367	A: yes, based on your description, it sounded like an unforgettable experience.
1368	A: that's all for now. thank you.
1369	A: i watch and play both.
1370	A: exactly, a professional closing such as "sincerely" or "best regards" would be appropriate.
1371	A: appreciated, that's helpful. i'll head there on foot.
1372	A: i know what you mean, it can be overwhelming.
1373	A: you can check the balance and transaction history of your commission fund. additionally, you can view the fund's net asset value and past performance.
1374	A: i see. i'll consider it.
1375	A: thank you. have a good day.
1376	A: agreed, let's also share the sunscreen to protect each other from the sun.
1377	A: yes, i am. glad to have an excuse to invite him over and share a nostalgic moment.
1378	sure thing, susan. let's make it 3:00 pm this afternoon at my office to discuss your new contract.
1379	A: could you please buy it today, george?
1380	A: (laughs) i'll give it a try. i used to love that song back in the day.
1381	A: i do enjoy the chill.
1382	B: i'm free on saturday to help with the move. let me know what time and i'll be there.
1383	yes, that's correct, a. co-production is a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parties, allowing them to leverage each other's strengths to expand their export trade.
1384	A: i'll process your lease and deposit now. welcome to your new apartment.
1385	A: i see. must have been a tough run for him.
1386	A: i'll write you a prescription for the medicine. rest and hydrate until then.
1387	i'd be happy to help you with the fliers, a. i'll stop by this afternoon to lend a hand.
1388	A: i've made some suggestions for lodging as well, you can find them in the same table. let me know if anything catches your eye.
1389	A: understood. i'll wait then.
1390	that's a great idea, a. let's do it!
1391	A: here you go, chloe. i've written a doctor's note for you. rest well and take care. call if you have any concerns.
1392	A: that's impressive. thank you for letting me know.
1393	A: i appreciate that. looking forward to it.
1394	A: certainly, another beer is on its way.
1395	B: i think he might not be telling the truth, based on the information given.
1396	A: that's true. despite the scandal, his presidential achievements are significant.
1397	A: i'll consider it, thank you. let me think about it. (implies a may still look for other options)
1398	the cost for the urgent dry-cleaning service would be 50% higher than the regular price. i'll calculate the total for you. (a pauses to check the price and then responds) it will be $xx.xx, please.
1399	A: thank you, i'll wait for your arrival.
1400	A: i understand how difficult it can be to leave an abusive relationship.
1401	A: the 12% discount applies for a two-week stay.
1402	i would listen to the consumer's concern, investigate the issue, and work towards finding a solution to satisfy them.
1403	A: i see your point, but isn't there a healthier way to relax and socialize?
1404	A: thank you, i'll go get the package now.
1405	A: let's split the load then.
1406	i understand, apologies for the mistake. we will send someone to heat up your food right away.
1407	B: that's interesting, it seems they have a strong bond outside of work.
1408	A: i'll consider your suggestions, but i'm worried about the legality of working illegally. i need a stable and legal job to ensure i can afford my rent and continue my studies.
1409	i see, that man over there with the cigar.
1410	i'll meet you at the bookstore at 1 pm to help you buy and sell your textbooks.
1411	A: yes, that's correct. tom's family is from maine.
1412	A: the length of stay can be discussed during check-in. enjoy your ordinary room for six.
1413	A: sure thing, honey. i'll turn on the heater for you.
1414	that's a good idea, a. let's hope for an improvement in our dining experience next time.
1415	B: ah, a meat-lovers stir fry! delightful. i'll leave the vegetarian option for myself then. enjoy your meal, a!
1416	A: of course, i'll help you.
1417	i'm glad to hear that, philip. your work truly stood out.
1418	A: i'll have it fixed as soon as possible.
1419	B: i'll pass this time, but thanks for offering.
1420	A: the date is mentioned on the form for you to fill out.
1421	B: maybe, why?
1422	A: that's wonderful to hear! we're all thrilled for you.
1423	A: i understand how you feel. it's tough when we make mistakes. let's focus on learning from them instead of dwelling on them. keep trying and don't give up.
1424	i'll wake up cindy now. (a)
1425	A: i see, were there specific reasons that made you transfer?
1426	A: i'll look forward to the dinner, john. bye.
1427	A: as soon as possible. i'll send a technician over to diagnose and fix the issue.
1428	i can begin right away, assuming the hiring process moves forward.
1429	A: that's a good suggestion. let's give it a try.
1430	A: i'll make sure to pay for the downloads.
1431	A: i see. i'll make sure to set aside enough time then.
1432	A: i understand, feel free to continue browsing. let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything specific you're looking for.
1433	sure, i'd be happy to offer you another option, free of charge. let me check with the kitchen to see what we have available that might suit your preference.
1434	A: understood. i'll make sure a staff member checks the mini bar and sends a tv guide to room 209.
1435	i work as a cultural liaison in a multinational corporation.
1436	A: i'm glad you found your way here eventually. enjoy your time at this school.
1437	A: i see, rugby is popular there as well. in my country, some people also follow it, but football is still the most loved sport.

1439	A: you're welcome, i'm glad everyone is having a great time. enjoy your birthday!

1443	i've heard good things about netflix. you should give it a try!
1444	the cost depends on the destination and the length of the document. i'll give you the exact price once i have these details.
1445	A: have a pleasant stay in room 105, mr. hilton. goodbye.
1446	A: it's not a cabin trip, it's a vacation in england. you'll be staying in accommodations such as hotels or bed and breakfasts.
1447	B: really? i felt the same way. they brought so much joy with their music.
1448	A: goodnight, b. i hope the yoga helps you sleep better. let me know if there's anything else i can do to help.
1449	B: i understand the risk-reward tradeoff, but i prefer a balanced approach.

1451	A: i'm sorry for the misunderstanding. thank you for letting me know.
1452	B: did you check the hotdog stand or the area around it?
1453	you're welcome, b. i'm glad i could help. good luck with your move!
1454	B: i'll prepare your library card now. please wait a moment.
1455	B: no, you'll be given the option to save any open files before rebooting.
1456	A: i understand. we'll assign you a quieter room tomorrow. good night, b.

1463	B: that's impressive, a. well done.
1464	A: you'll get the hang of it in no time. here's a list of departments with their locations and managers.
1465	A: sounds good to me, let's clock out and rest before tomorrow.
1466	it's understandable. i wish your daughter a quick recovery. no offense taken.
1467	B: i've tried, but it's not possible for us to reconcile. the children's well-being is a priority, and we'll need to find a solution that's best for them.
1468	A: i understand. it can be challenging to adapt to new conditions.
1469	i look forward to calling you soon.
1470	B: he prefers not to, due to traffic and parking issues in the city.

1473	A: i see. that makes sense. (or) understood. (or) i'll keep it safe then. (or) thank you for explaining.
1474	based on the title given, "doctor butcher," it's reasonable to assume that there may be elements of suspense in the series. however, without further information, it's hard to definitively answer your question, a. to learn more about the specific content and suspense factors in "doctor butcher," consider watching a review or preview, or asking b for more details if they have seen it.
1475	A: that's true. he seems to prioritize financial gain in his plans.
1476	A: i'll show you how then.
1477	B: through positive reinforcement and encouraging his genuine achievements.
1478	B: i'll consider it, thank you for the concern.
1479	B: of course, a. i'll check the receipt and the transaction record to see if there was an error. please give me a moment.
1480	B: yes, i do.
1481	A: absolutely, i'd be happy to help you practice again on wednesday.
1482	A: it seems he hasn't made an official proposal yet.
1483	B: that's not necessary, a. i'll go on vacation with mark, but i still live here with you.

1485	sure, i can bring you some to-go boxes when i return with your receipt.
1486	A: i've noticed some people value wealth highly. it's not a priority for me.

1490	B: i understand your situation, but our pricing policy is non-negotiable at this time.

1495	indeed, it is. enjoy your travels, landy.
1496	B: nice to meet you, steven smith. i'm emily johnson.
1497	A: i see, thank you for sharing your experience. i'll look into other options.
1498	i understand your disappointment. older campuses have their charm, but lack the modern amenities you might prefer.
1499	that's a good idea, let's do that.
1500	A: stereotypes are not factual. we all have unique abilities.
1501	B: i'll look for houses in pasadena or arcadia with a view, medium size, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, and in the abc school district.

1516	A: i'm genuinely happy for you both. it's clear that you have something special.
1517	i've considered that, but sometimes people need to learn on their own. let's focus on supporting him when he's ready.
1518	yes, 9:20 works for me, mr. a. let's move forward with the meeting.
1519	B: i'm just having fun, it's all in good spirit, a. people will understand it's just halloween.
1520	A: sure, i will let you know when it's done.
1521	i'm considering a new opportunity that aligns better with my long-term career goals. the growth here has been rewarding, but i believe i can make an even greater impact in my next role.
1522	B: maybe you could build up your confidence first, a? practice makes perfect.
1523	A: in some cases, yes. but it ensures that we provide the best possible service to our customers by utilizing specialized expertise when needed.
1524	A: that's a great idea, b. let's do that.
1525	B: i see. that must have been painful for them.
1526	A: i'm asking about the bid, not your nicknames. yes or no, please.
1527	thank you, a. enjoy your meal and your change is 6 dollars.
1528	sure, a bar sounds great. let's go catch up. when and where shall we meet?
1529	A: sounds good to me. i'll confirm the lunch plans with you later this week.
1530	A: it was still enjoyable company then. (or: i focused more on the conversation.)
1531	A: i understand your concerns, but let's focus on studying and giving it our best effort. we have time to prepare and review the material.
1532	i'll think about it. the potential savings sound attractive, but i still need to consider my budget and commuting habits.
1533	a (holding out a small glass of water for b): enjoy.
1534	let's head to the gym instead. dancing and singsong it is.
1535	A: (signs voucher) here you go.
1536	B: great, that's taken care of then.
1537	A: i'll make sure of it.

1551	B: that sign might have been for a different item. make sure to double-check before bidding.
1552	A: i'll text them instead, you focus on renting the jet ski.
1553	i understand your concern, but ultimately it's my decision to make. i have weighed the options and have chosen to pursue better opportunities elsewhere.

1719	no, it's not a surprise at all. she has always been dedicated to her studies.
1720	that's a wise approach, a. good luck to you.
1721	i don't mind at all, joan. enjoy your holiday.
1722	A: i agree, we need to focus more on our studies. let's make a plan to improve our grades next semester.
1723	there may be costs for food and activities at the seaside. let's bring our own snacks and plan for a simple dinner, but we should budget some money for any additional expenses.
1724	A: thank you, i will go to window number eleven to buy the ticket.
1725	B: i see. i'll remember that for future meals.
1726	A: i'll direct you to the second floor, then. the nike store is there.
1727	i'm here if you need anything, take care.
1728	A: thank you. i'll keep that in mind.
1729	B: perhaps he has no other options.
1730	be careful not to tear the papers when removing the jam. let me know if you need help.
1731	A: i see, that must keep you busy. good luck with your new job.
1732	A: i understand your perspective, but it's important to consider both opportunities and challenges.
1733	A: china standard time is eight hours ahead of pacific standard time. therefore, during daylight saving time in california, the difference is nine hours. so, when transitioning from beijing time back to california time, you would need to subtract one hour.
1734	A: i'll need to check the availability for a one-way ticket for one adult to chicago, please.
1735	i'll check the warranty and receipt to see what options are available for you, sir.
1736	A: that's a better choice for the dinner party. let's go.
1737	you could try compressing the attachment or splitting it into smaller parts before sending it again.
1738	thank you, i'll keep you informed when we approach wangfujing.
1739	A: it depends on the availability of the specific item. for in-stock items, we can typically provide same-day or next-day delivery. for custom orders or items not in stock, it may take several days to weeks.
1740	A: six to two, with some flexibility.
1741	A: at least they didn't take the diamond rings in the jewel box. b: true, but they did take my favorite earrings.
1742	ouch, that's a painful loss. with those odds, it should have been a sure bet.
1743	B: not yet, but i'm training hard to get there.
1744	A: you're welcome, feel free to ask if you have any other questions about chinese liquors or wines. enjoy your maotai tonight!
1745	B: i'm calls from company x. can i leave a message for john doe, extension 123?
1746	A: i understand, but acknowledgment is the first step towards reconciliation. b: true, but denial only perpetuates the problem.
1747	A: i understand, monica. please include your english proficiency and travel availability in your cover letter when submitting your cv.
1748	B: i won the lottery last week.
1749	B: yes, i have. he mentioned some bullying at school today. i'm going to speak with the teacher about it.
1750	A: yes, there are signposts to help guide us throughout the hike.
1751	B: i see, he can be quite difficult to approach.
1752	B: i'd be happy to consider it again, but my asking price for the apartment is $1050 per month.
1753	A: tea and dessert forks are on the way. enjoy your apple crisp and chocolate mousse cake.
1754	that's a great suggestion, a. i'll recommend the youth restaurant to b for a cheerful atmosphere and a happy dining experience.
1755	likewise, ms. jenson. pleased to make your acquaintance. (or simply: pleased to meet you, mary.)
1756	B: i enjoy playing basketball the most.
1757	A: i'll process your payment and give you the cash back. please wait a moment.
1758	A: i'm glad you think so. the apartment has two bedrooms and a balcony overlooking the park. b: wow, that's nice. is it close to public transportation? a: yes, it's within walking distance to the subway station. b: that's perfect. how soon can you move in? a: the lease starts in two weeks. i've already put in my application. b: congratulations! i'm sure you'll love your new place.
1759	A: thank you, i will try that.
1760	that's interesting. what specific dishes come with each course in western food?
1761	B: the new model should handle solitaire smoothly with its advanced specifications. the price is $800.
1762	A: great, looking forward to your arrival on monday. welcome on board!
1763	B: i took the lead on that project, a. you know that.
1764	B: some hosts do, but there are also those who can really make the show entertaining.
1765	A: i have faith in his abilities to bring about change.
1766	A: i'm glad to have you here, mr. smith. let me give you a tour.
1767	thank you for sharing the great news, lily. i'm excited for your adventure in china. safe travels!
1768	sure, let's explore other areas of the exhibition together.
1769	A: i'll consider it, the price seems a bit high.
1770	A: that's inspiring. self-teaching is the way to go. keep up the great work!
1771	A: i see, you both were focused on each other instead of navigating properly. be more attentive next time.
1772	B: i've always enjoyed expressing creativity through clothes. it would be exciting to bring that vision to life for others. how about you, what attracts you to dress designing, a?
1773	that's great to hear! i'm sure you'll have a fantastic time together.
1774	i'm glad to hear that you're excited about the gift. the mac will be shipped to your address within a few business days. once it arrives, you can set it up for your daughter and help her get started with the new laptop. enjoy her reaction on the special day!
1775	A: sure, here is an extra textbook for you, mary. let's get started. (hands a book to b and points to page 10)
1776	A: i'd be happy to, if you invite me explicitly.
1777	i'll arrange for a taxi to take you to rockefeller center as soon as possible. please make your way down to the lobby when you're ready.
1778	A: excellent choice, sir. i'll begin the booking process for you. please provide some personal information and we'll have everything arranged by the end of the week. welcome to hawaii!
1779	A: i'd recommend over-the-counter pain medication for now. come back if it doesn't improve.
1780	yes, i do like red apples.
1781	B: i understand the challenges you face with l/c payments. let's explore other options, such as open account or bank guarantees, to find a mutually beneficial solution.
1782	B: those options aren't much healthier than your initial suggestion, a. let's compromise and order a pizza with veggies and a side salad.
1783	B: sure thing, a. i'll give you some space.
1784	i hope so, but in the meantime, there's a restroom nearby if you need it.
1785	A: i'm having dinner with my family.
1786	that's correct. with dial-up, your phone line is monopolized when you're online, preventing you from using the phone for calls. dsl, on the other hand, is a separate line that allows you to use both the phone and the internet simultaneously.
1787	B: that's unfortunate. odds of 20 to 1 are usually good bets.
1788	A: no, that's not necessary, but you do need to prioritize and commit to improving your situation.
1789	A: i didn't realize. what about dogs then?
1790	yes, i do love her. but the depth of her feelings for me is still unclear.
1791	you could make a list and prioritize based on your current preferences.
1792	A: i could learn if you teach me, or i could refer clients to you instead.
1793	A: yes, we provide training and an annual travel opportunity for our staff.
1794	i'm willing to travel if it's required for the job, sir.
1795	A: i'll go with the paperback then.
1796	A: understood, i'll look forward to discussing salary details during the job offer.
1797	A: i'll have a glass of red wine with that.
1798	A: i'll confirm the delivery details for thursday at 1:15 pm for the filing cabinets and desk unit.
1799	A: i'd be happy to exchange contact information, b. here's my number. let's confirm our meeting time for tomorrow at 10 at this cafe. see you then!
1800	that's great to hear. switzerland seems to have left a positive impression on your friend.
1801	A: sure, i'd be happy to meet him. thank you, simon.
1802	B: that could be an option, but i have reservations about the cost and crowd.
1803	i couldn't agree more, let's aim for a peaceful and drama-free living environment.
1804	B: it can be complex with deep strategy, but mastering the basics is key.
1805	B: i've heard great things about it. have you seen it before?
1806	A: let's enjoy this moment, free from reality together.
1807	B: my salary is competitive for my position and experience level in the federal government.
1808	i will place that order for you. your drinks will be with you shortly. enjoy your wait!
1809	A: i'm glad to hear that, susan. enjoy the rest of your day.
1810	A: how do i get a boarding pass?
1811	A: i understand the road conditions, but haven't we discussed rotating driving tasks for safety and comfort?
1812	A: my pleasure, mr. bradley. the bellboy is on his way. enjoy your stay.
1813	B: i have a lid that should fit. let me go get it for you.
1814	A: see you later, francis. enjoy your yogurt shopping.
1815	yes, it is earlier than usual for l'oreal's campus recruitment.
1816	for long distance calls, dial 0 and then ask the operator for assistance.
1817	A: we'll address the cavity during the same appointment, but for now, let's focus on your wisdom tooth. the x-rays will give us a clearer picture.
1818	B: he's not here today.
1819	A: (laughing) you got me, b! happy april fool's day!
1820	yes, that's right. i'm planning to have a barbecue next weekend. would you like to come?
1821	A: understood, i'll pay the fee for the refund. thank you for your help.
1822	A: you're right, the industrial cleaning products had a significant increase in sales. let's focus on that success and address the issue with the marketing plan for the hair products.
1823	A: i'll try to make it then with your encouragement.
1824	i'd be happy to go for a ride with you.
1825	B: absolutely, i'll find you some pictures that match your preferred style for the new permanent wave.
1826	preparing thoughtful questions shows initiative and engagement. remember to practice active listening as well.
1827	A: goodbye, b. i wish you a swift recovery.
1828	A: understood. be careful backing up and let me know when you're ready to go.
1829	A: no, the pass ensures you won't get into trouble for leaving the classroom.
1830	A: i see. i'll need to consider that. thank you for the information.
1831	A: that's sweet of you to offer, but i assure you, i can lead the way. let's give it a try.
1832	B: i'm glad you enjoyed your meal, a. your doggy bag will be ready when you are.
1833	B: i usually offer to pay my share, but john insists on treating me.
1834	B: either is fine, sir. we have delivery slots available throughout the day on saturdays.
1835	B: yes, that's a clever one. i get it now.
1836	A: i'll keep that in mind, thank you.
1837	A: thanks for the suggestions, i'll take these two items. let's hope she likes them.
1838	B: yes, there are combo tickets available for multiple spots.
1839	A: i'm open to traveling as long as the frequency is not too high and is manageable with my other responsibilities.
1840	A: thank you, mr. donsie. i'll look up your reservation now.
1841	i see. we might have to walk a bit to find the correct stop. apologies for the confusion.
1842	it's going well, i'm learning a lot.
1843	A: agreed, accountability and efficiency are key in addressing any social problem, including education. let's work together to find solutions that minimize costs while maximizing impact.
1844	A: yes, it looks fine. let me know if you need assistance with anything else.
1845	A: understood, i'll make sure to have our luggage ready by then.
1846	A: yes, i can arrange that for you, mr. smith.
1847	A: i'll consider a mazda or honda.
1848	A: there should be safety measures in place with a group tour. let's enjoy the experience.
1849	prof. yang: those memorandums of understanding are a positive step towards enhancing intellectual property rights protection in the targeted asian countries. however, ongoing monitoring and enforcement are crucial to ensure effective implementation. thoroughly research and select reliable local partners for your business ventures, and consider engaging in local registrations and filings to maximize protection. additionally, keep abreast of any updates and changes in local intellectual property laws and regulations.
1850	A: yes, that's correct. we need to wait for attendance before leaving.
1851	A: yes, please. i'd like to exchange it for a sweater without any defects.
1852	A: i see, cost and language can be deterrents for some.
1853	A: that's impressive. thank you for letting me know.
1854	A: i understand, but the monotony is starting to wear on me already.
1855	A: perhaps we can arrange that for the next event. i have some personal errands to attend to.
1856	A: maybe it won't be as boring as you think, let's give it a chance.
1857	B: i'll study seriously, mum. (or) i'll stay home tonight and focus on my studies.
1858	A: i suggest checking your recent transactions for any errors or uncashed checks. b: okay, i'll do that right away.
1859	B: consider using a mask or finding a less congested route for cycling. the benefits of regular exercise and reduced commuting time often outweigh the drawbacks.
1860	B: i see. (or: i didn't know that.)
1861	based on your hobbies, it seems you lean more towards being extroverted.
1862	A: alright, let's go to my office to file a report and discuss further steps to locate your phone.
1863	A: i'm making my own choices, dad. that's all i meant.
1864	A: thank you for the suggestion, i'll make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
1865	i enjoy playing basketball and soccer. how about you, a? what are your hobbies?
1866	A: sounds good, i'll meet you there.
1867	i've had extensive english language training, both formally and through everyday use.
1868	i've noted that down, a. the vet visit is at 11 a.m. on saturday.
1869	A: i'm here to help. let me see if there's an alternative flight for you.
1870	A: i see. prioritize your concert over schoolwork then. good luck with that.
1871	A: i'm sorry, i can't offer any solutions this time. try applying again next year.
1872	B: i'm not sure yet, please check with the school for the exact date.
1873	B: check the garbage or the refrigerator for spoiled food.
1874	i will do, and thank you. goodbye for now.
1875	A: yes, exactly. his expertise warrants recognition and respect during talks related to the tang dynasty.
1876	B: i'll look into that possibility. thanks for bringing it up.
1877	B: i'm not angry, just frustrated. there are a lot of things on my mind right now.
1878	A: i've been offered an opportunity for professional growth and decided it was time for a change.
1879	i'll see what i can do to expedite the process, but a three-day turnaround may not be possible for an order of that size. i'll let you know as soon as i have an update.
1880	A: thank you, b. the same to you.
1881	A: i appreciate your generosity, helen. i'll make it up to you when i return.
1882	A: understood, b. i'll do my best.
1883	i see. you mentioned the cost. i can help you look for affordable options online or contact real estate agents for rentals within your budget. let me know if you'd like me to help.
1884	B: that's a threat, i take my commitments seriously and i'm not a threat to our relationship.
1885	that's a great idea, i'd be happy to join you for a walk.
1886	B: no, it was the london times. i worked there for five years before moving on to my current role in a media consulting firm.
1887	A: i'd be happy to help you with that as well. let me know if there's anything else you need assistance with.
1888	i see. your opinion differs from mine then. he may have persuasive skills, but that doesn't make his statements truthful.
1889	A: i'll check if we have a bilingual guide available for you.
1890	A: maybe there's a different study method that could help you understand the material better.
1891	A: yes, please let me install an anti-virus software on your pc to help remove the virus and protect your data.
1892	B: sure, let's head to the restaurant now.
1893	the classic lasagna is a great choice. i'll prepare that for you.
1894	yes, he did. his leadership and unwavering commitment to justice continue to inspire us.
1895	B: the cost for printing in the lobby is $0.15 per page.
1896	based on your current cash card balance and the minimum purchase requirement, you can purchase additional 5,000 fund units. let me know if you'd like to add more units beyond this.
1897	yes, i do still play piano. it's one of my favorite hobbies.
1898	B: okay, let's go.
1899	rest and hydrate yourself. consider taking over-the-counter medication for your symptoms. if they worsen, consult a healthcare professional.
1900	A: i see, good luck with that.
1901	A: maybe we could learn from him then. let's do some research before making a decision.
1902	A: i see. personal space will be a nice change then.
1903	A: i can see how it might be effective for some people, but i find it excessive and unnecessary.
1904	i'm sorry, but i cannot offer you one free item with the purchase of four at this time.
1905	yes, i understand. keep going straight, then turn right after the first left you come across, and then turn right at the next intersection.
1906	B: i'm not feeling well today.
1907	A: i hope so, for the sake of the civilians.
1908	B: i completely agree with you, a. peter's expertise is truly impressive.
1909	A: that's wonderful news! i'm glad to hear it.
1910	A: appreciate your help, b. i'll take the 486 then.
1911	A: you're welcome. i'll provide you with a deposit form to fill out before completing the transaction.
1912	B: i'll ask about the discount when we get to the ticket counter.
1913	B: that's nice! have you considered buying it?
1914	B: to the market.
1915	B: originally from south asia, particularly india. now grown in tropical regions like mexico, thailand, and pakistan.
1916	A: i'm good too, thanks for asking. how about we catch up for coffee sometime this week?
1917	yes, please provide your trouser size, sir.
1918	you could retake the exam or seek additional help and preparation next time around. let's work on improving together.
1919	agreed, let's stay connected.
1920	B: i'm sorry to hear that. you could offer to replace it with a new one and apologize sincerely.
1921	i'd be glad to print and edit the document for you.
1922	prepare thoughtful questions to demonstrate your interest and engagement.
1923	sure, here are a few examples of itineraries we created for different types of tourists: 1. family with young children: visit amusement parks, zoos, and museums with kid-friendly exhibits. 2. couple on honeymoon: romantic dinners, wine tasting tours, and scenic hikes. 3. senior citizens: cultural tours, leisurely walks, and visits to historical sites with wheelchair accessibility. 4. adventure seekers: extreme sports, bunge
1924	B: oh, i see. i can do online shopping as well, but i still prefer going to physical stores.
1925	A: yes, i have everything i need, mom.
1926	i'll make sure to schedule your appointment with dr. smith on wednesday at 10 a.m.
1927	A: let's make an appointment first to ensure the doctor is available. we don't want your condition to worsen while we wait. b: okay, i'll call the clinic to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. a: good decision. let's head there now. (end of conversation.)
1928	B: i'm glad to hear that. i'll try to keep an open mind during his next class.
1929	A: i'd appreciate it if you could send me the directions for confirmation.
1930	yes, there is extra pay for working overtime.
1931	A: i'm glad we both found value in the deal.
1932	A: thank you for your guidance, b. i'll make sure to include all those elements in my resume.
1933	B: i understand, a. you don't have a breastfeeding issue, you're very hungry. let's find you something to eat.
1934	A: i mean, maybe it's time for a well-deserved break. your hard work will still be appreciated, but don't compromise your health.
1935	i agree, a. let's look forward to another beautiful day tomorrow.
1936	A: i have found a double room with a bath available for five nights starting tonight. may i have your name, please?
1937	A: oh, i see. in that case, perhaps we should water the flowers now to give them a good drink before the rain comes.
1938	A: i'm glad you think so. let me know if you need anything else.
1939	A: i understand, mum. thank you for your support. i will do better next time.
1940	A: i cannot make a promise about that without consulting the prosecution first. please provide any evidence or information you have that could exonerate you or point to the true perpetrator.
1941	A: i see, that makes the process clearer. i'll make sure to reach out to a program adviser for guidance. thank you, b.
1942	B: it's a victory worth savoring, isn't it?
1943	A: it includes all your appointments for the day. b: i see, i'll make sure to attend them all.
1944	A: i see, she writes then.
1945	A: yes, it would be helpful if you could.
1946	A: impressive accomplishments. i look forward to reading your work.
1947	nice talking to you too, john. have a great shopping trip.
1948	i'll go get security right away.
1949	i see. that must have been a difficult night for mike.
1950	i completely agree, and i'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to the team and help the company continue its success.
1951	B: i'd be up for that. let me finish this episode first, then we can start.
1952	i'd be happy to help you meet new people, a. let's go introduce ourselves together.
1953	A: is the date a regular occurrence now? (or) i see, they have a date night planned.
1954	B: i appreciate your understanding. thank you.
1955	A: i didn't know that about his military background. it might bring a unique perspective to the class.
1956	sure, i'll start on the name list while you get the coffee.
1957	A: i understand how difficult it can be to leave an abusive relationship. is there a way i can help her contact the authorities or find resources for her safety?
1958	B: to prevent potential damage from the elements or theft.
1959	A: thank you, i appreciate it. (indicates direction) b: you're welcome. (gestures towards bathroom)
1960	A: certainly, i'll make sure the card reads "secret admirer" and arrange for delivery to the provided address with your dozen long-stemmed roses.
1961	A: i'm here to give you a trim, not an opinion on your hairstyle. let's focus on making your sideburns even and keeping your hair length just as you've requested.
1962	yes, i'm familiar with your school and its reputation for excellence in education. i believe i could contribute positively to your team as a teacher.
1963	sure, let's have dinner together and catch up, cousin gretchen.
1964	A: i'm glad to hear that. enjoy reading it and continue making progress in your work.
1965	A: perhaps, but at what cost? (implying that while adults may have had more free time to play as children, today's children may be missing out on important experiences and developing skills through play)
1966	A: i see. it's still worth the cost for the content, though.
1967	A: the museums and shopping in new york are truly amazing. you'll have a great time.
1968	B: that's interesting. i hadn't heard that. good for him.
1969	A: i see. good luck with your future education and career goals.
1970	i get frustrated when projects take longer than anticipated or when progress is hindered unexpectedly.
1971	A: i see, we all have our fears. mine just happens to be small spaces. can't say i look forward to being in a crowded plane or a cramped elevator with you.
1972	A: you're welcome, derek. i'll be here if you have any further questions while completing your application.
1973	A: thank you, i'll find the escalator. (or) got it, i'll head to the escalator and look for gate 12.
1974	A: here is your replacement books. the $5 will be charged to your account.
1975	A: what time in the morning, specifically?
1976	A: we'll keep that in mind for future opportunities. good luck in your future endeavors.
1977	B: that's not fair treatment.
1978	A: i'll start swimming three times a week then, thank you for the suggestion.
1979	you're welcome. good luck, and please let me know if you need anything else.
1980	i'll be there with the receipt by 10 o'clock to exchange the broken pen.
1981	A: that's a good idea, i'll try it.
1982	A: appreciate it. i'll check out the shop first, then find the men's room.
1983	i prefer working with enthusiastic and dynamic individuals who share similar goals and values.
1984	B: yes, it's impressive. he must have a natural aptitude for languages.
1985	A: the euro has shown more stability recently compared to the dollar, but it's essential to consider various factors before making an investment decision. the yen is another option, but it depends on your risk tolerance and investment goals.
1986	A: "it reads: 'meet me in the conference room at eight.' no name signed."
1987	i don't know, she wasn't in the room when i left.
1988	A: i'll check her schedule for tuesday at merton financial advisors and get back to you as soon as possible.
1989	A: i understand, but my business appointment conflicts with the polling hours.
1990	yes, please bring some to-go boxes for us as well. thank you.
1991	A: i can see how they use publicity for their careers, but the constant attention must be draining. maybe they deserve their success, but it doesn't negate the challenges they face.

1998	A: fair enough. everyone has their preferences.
1999	A: yes, in australia, firefighters have successfully contained a large bushfire that had been threatening several towns. the situation is currently under control.
2000	A: i see. please try to remember any details about the intruders' appearances or actions before they covered their faces. the police will need any information you can provide.

2023	A: i can help you with that as well. let me finish up here first.
2024	B: i see. the lotion and antihistamine should help with the symptoms. make sure to keep cleaning the affected area to prevent spreading the oil. let me know if you need anything else.
2025	i have given you rib 1,616 as per the current exchange rate and the amount you requested. please find the cash and exchange memo in front of you for your records. please check and confirm the amounts.
2026	A: enjoy your picnic with jennie!
2027	B: i didn't accuse you, i only mentioned that it was last seen in your possession.
2028	A: that's a great idea, b. let's go to the park.
2029	movie theaters have evolved significantly over the years, offering various experiences likeimax, 3d, and even reclining seats. drive-in theaters, however, have become less common due to the rise of indoor theaters and changing entertainment preferences.
2030	A: i've tried talking to him, but he's not receptive to changing his habits. i guess it's time for me to find a new place to live.
2031	A: i see. you may need to deposit more funds to cover the check amount and any associated fees.
2032	A: what did he mean by "a blind alley"?
2033	A: i'll consider it, but i don't need a sunroof.
2034	B: my shift schedule is already set.
2035	great, i'll make sure to be there at 8 pm. looking forward to the curry!
2036	B: i've been traveling in south america. long time no see, a.

2038	A: i appreciate it. let me know what you have.
2039	A: i'm glad you enjoyed it. feel free to bring your friends next time as well. let me show you to the waiting area while we prepare the clarifying cream for your return visit.

2042	A: thank you, that clarifies it. i will remember that.
2043	A: that's impressive reach he has.
2044	B: i see, thank you for letting me know. i'll put my cigarette out.
2045	A: i see. honesty is definitely important. hope your new friend embodies that quality.
2046	that would be a great choice for your little girl. thank you for considering our menu options. i will make note of that for your order.
2047	sure, i can suggest a nearby place for us to grab dinner.
2048	B: just one copy for each diploma, please.
2049	A: looking forward to your arrival at 9 am next monday, b. see you then.
2050	A: i'll consider that, thank you for the advice, b.
2051	A: i appreciate your help, miss lee. i'm excited to get settled in. (or) it's great to have a warm welcome. thank you. (or) i'll make good use of these resources, miss lee. (or) i'm grateful for the support as i get started.
2052	A: i had no idea, mr. smith. i apologize for the misunderstanding.
2053	A: that's an interesting observation. the convenience and speed of other modes of transportation have indeed made boats less appealing to many people.
2054	i'll check if that line is available for you.
2055	A: yes, the checkroom is to the right of the entrance.
2056	A: i'm not in the business of pity, dave. let's focus on our deals.
2057	A: huangshan it is then. i'll start planning the trip.
2058	B: i'm here if she needs to talk as well. a: that's very kind of you, but i think professional help would benefit her more at this moment.
2059	yes, they're in the cabinet above the dishwasher. you can place those on the table as well if we're having soup as a starter.
2060	A: i see, so that's for the meals then. thank you for clarifying.
2061	B: it was around five dollars for this bag.
2062	A: i see your point, but i can't help worrying about her.
2063	A: that's true, no costumes for chinese ghost month. happy celebrating!
2064	A: i have other plans.
2065	i agree, it's important to pay parking fines promptly to avoid any additional penalties.
2066	B: i'm glad you asked, a. the price varies, but i'd be happy to provide you with a quote once i have more information about your specific needs. could you please provide some details?
2067	B: that's wonderful. i'm sure junior will love the outdoor facilities and the easy access to a library.
2068	B: i didn't say that, but wealth and happiness are not directly linked.
2069	A: that's generous of you, but i'd still like to be paid for my services.
2070	i can meet you at the cinema instead. let's check the showtimes for the film.
2071	B: that's a valid point, but cutting off financial support can also harm innocent civilians and potentially worsen the situation. diplomacy and peaceful negotiations are often the best solutions, though they can be difficult to implement.
2072	A: i see, parking can be a challenge in the city.
2073	those are great ideas, b. we'll consider adding a car wash and candy sales to our fundraisers. thank you for the suggestions.
2074	A: that's exciting to hear! kenny sounded full of energy.
2075	A: i see, your setup seems more flexible. mine is quite restrictive.
2076	B: you may think that now, but give it a chance. the passion and intensity among fans is unmatched in soccer. it's not just about falling down or using hands, it's about strategy, teamwork, and skill. you might be surprised by how much you enjoy it.
2077	A: my sister can come, making it fourteen people. superstition or not, i believe we can handle it.
2078	A: you're welcome. goodbye, b. we'll be in touch next week about setting up an interview.
2079	B: they should report it then. labor laws protect them.
2080	B: have you checked the usual places, like your pockets, purse, or kitchen counter?
2081	B: i'll have that prepared for you right away.
2082	A: that's an intriguing name! must have been a great experience going out with david then. i'm glad you had a great time.
2083	A: i believe you find it very appealing.
2084	A: and some nuts, please. b: perrier, jim beam, apples, and nuts it is, sir.
2085	A: those dishes are popular choices, i'd be happy to recommend them.
2086	i find it intriguing to connect with individuals whose personalities differ from mine. it broadens my perspective and enriches my experiences.
2087	A: she mentioned this weekend.
2088	B: i see, that's reassuring.
2089	A: let's check the map then, just to be sure.
2090	A: the lobby is in the direction of exit b. good luck, sir.
2091	A: r :: thank you, mr. johnson. your guaranteed reservation for a twin room from april 16th to 20th, at a total cost of $720, has been confirmed. i have processed your payment with american express card number 134986. your welcome package and room details will be sent to you via email. is there anything else i can help you with, sir?
2092	A: thank you for choosing hamilton's heating and cooling service, b. i will contact you shortly with a technician availability. goodbye for now.
2093	A: i'm confident you'll excel then. welcome to the team.
2094	A: my pleasure, have a great day at the laundry, sir.
2095	A: i'm glad to hear that. your promotion is well-deserved. keep up the good work.
2096	great, here are the details for the double room without a view for one night. please come to the reception desk to check in.
2097	yes, i think so. did you have a long night?
2098	i'll ask and let you know.
2099	i'll make sure to update the anti-virus software and be more careful. no more computer violence!
2100	B: yes, that's a perk, but tuition fees still add up with so many siblings attending. education costs are significant in our family.
2101	A: i see. just add hot water to the ground coffee in your cup then. enjoy your coffee.
2102	A: great, i'll make a reservation for four at 7:00 pm. looking forward to your visit.
2103	i will make sure to adhere to the working hours and use the employee card accordingly.
2104	A: not particularly.
2105	B: yes, i am planning to study abroad.
2106	A: okay, i'll look for the first lights and cross the street to find westlake restaurant.
2107	B: i'm sorry to hear that, a. i'll help you fix it or find a solution as soon as i can.
2108	our clients include hospitals, hotels, and small factories, both locally and internationally.
2109	A: ifind it hard to believe, there are no eagles in this area.
2110	i'm sorry for your inconvenience. you'll need to pay without a ticket.
2111	A: understood, b. i respect your company's dress code.
2112	A: of course, i'd love to see the photos from your holiday in ireland.
2113	B: i don't believe you anymore.
2114	A: i believe in your potential.
2115	B: i'm glad you feel more comfortable, ryan. don't hesitate to ask if you have any other questions or concerns. enjoy the service.
2116	A: yes, i was told to stay in bed for ten days with the flu.
2117	i look forward to our weekend rest.
2118	A: yes, let's place our samples on the table for visitors to see.
2119	A: too bad for you then. enjoy your elvis records, trev.
2120	the price is displayed next to each chocolate varietal. please check the labels.
2121	i work in finance. i'm an investment banker based here in new york. nice to meet you, shirley.
2122	A: that's unfortunate for ted. i've learned the importance of sticking to a solid investment strategy.
2123	A: the sony one looks good, but i still prefer a model with separate speakers for better sound quality.
2124	B: i understand your predicament. however, our hands are tied in this matter. you may want to consider exploring other options, such as filing a complaint with the shipping company or the exporting country's embassy.
2125	B: you will be heading generally north to reach the allied irish bank. i'll draw a map for you to help guide you there.
2126	A: i appreciate the offer, but i'll pass for now, thank you. i'll wait near the counters instead.
2127	i will drive carefully, sir. we'll make it to the station in due time despite the traffic.
2128	it was great, thank you for asking. enjoyed some much-needed relaxation and new experiences.
2129	let me check it out. (a)
2130	B: i wasn't aware, but it doesn't change how i feel. i admire women who are strong and capable of balancing both personal and family life.
2131	B: absolutely, making a visually appealing and mess-free sandwich is essential. you can also consider using toothpicks or skewers to secure any ingredients that might slip out. regarding condiments, don't hesitate to experiment with different combinations to find your preferred taste.
2132	yes, that's correct. make sure your back remains straight and your chest is up. go down as far as you can while keeping your form, then stand back up. do three sets of 12-15 reps for best results.
2133	B: i apologize for that. i'll make sure to include more time for discussion in future meetings.
2134	i'm glad you think so, b. melbourne zoo takes great care in providing a habitat that's as close to natural as possible for its inhabitants.
2135	A: thank you, steven. i appreciate your help in making the dumplings together. let's get started with the vegetables then.
2136	B: i said the new project proposal was approved by the team and we will start implementation next week.
2137	i will provide you with the factory address as soon as i have it confirmed. thank you for your patience.
2138	B: i'll need to check with management to see if that's possible, but i'll get back to you as soon as i have an answer.
2139	B: of course, it means i'll try my best to help you with your request, but i have limitations. as for the word, it is "will you please." in this context, it is a polite way to make a request.
2140	A: yes, let's share a taxi to your house on huanghe road, which is near the university next to the teachers' college. it's more cost-effective, and your chinese is better than mine, making communication with the driver easier.
2141	A: you're welcome, have a nice trip. we'll see you at 9:00 am tomorrow with your receipt for pick-up of your luggage from room 1218. goodbye.
2142	A: that's fine, we'll take it.
2143	A: i don't think sarah's car is typically pink for her, it's violet.
2144	A: i'll prepare your prescription while you choose your frames.
2145	you too, karren. goodbye.
2146	yes, that's right. i'm sorry to hear that.
2147	A: i'll complete the form now.
2148	that's unfortunate, but we'll have to make our way there then. (or: we'll have to walk all the way down then.)
2149	A: i see. that's interesting.
2150	B: two or three, possibly one in the living room and one in each bedroom.
2151	A: i didn't think it was worth the cost. i moved on to using my phone for music instead.
2152	B: coming right up, two burgers on the way.
2153	A: of course, i'd be happy to gift-wrap it for you.
2154	A: i'll be happy to help you find an appropriate mortgage option for your first apartment purchase. this brochure should provide you with useful information for first-time buyers.
2155	A: thank you, i appreciate it. i'll give it a try.
2156	A: why didn't you consider my feelings before keeping this a secret?
2157	i'll check availability in row 6 for you.
2158	A: i'd be happy to discuss the specifics of the sales role with you, melinda. let's head to your office or the conference room to go over the details.
2159	B: you're welcome. have a good day.
2160	you're welcome, it's no problem. good luck with your journey. (a)
2161	A: how about finding a blanket instead?
2162	A: i'll make the chicken and potatoes then.
2163	i understand your concern, but i'm prepared to make the move if selected for the position. my family supports my career goals and is open to the idea of living abroad.
2164	i have a bachelor's degree in accounting and i've completed several relevant certifications such as cpa and cma.
2165	B: understood, a. i'll catch up with you later.
2166	A: you might be surprised, give it a try once.
2167	A: yes, they seem to be.
2168	i'll send the taxi to the friendship hotel, room 1106. estimated arrival time: 12:30 p.m. for the airport pick-up.
2169	A: i'm sorry, let's go to the hospital right away. i'll call an ambulance.
2170	A: that's a good idea, b. i'll do the same. let's explore new interests together.
2171	A: seven o'clock should be fine. thank you.
2172	A: i have a table in the private room at 7:30 pm reserved under the name "nova, fashion clothes company manager." confirmed.
2173	B: i'll definitely keep that in mind. thanks for the suggestion.
2174	B: alright, mr. black. i'll make a reservation for you and your party of three at 11:30 tomorrow. i look forward to welcoming you then.
2175	A: maybe you can ask the office to check if that's possible.
2176	thank you, i appreciate it. i'll be sure to make it a great one for your book.
2177	A: good luck with your registration, karen. let me know if you encounter any issues.
2178	B: i've had enough rest, it's not about that.
2179	A: i understand, it can be costly to fix an appliance. laundromats can be a more affordable alternative for now.
2180	A: absolutely, i can use cedar for your deck. let me know the size and other specifications you have in mind.
2181	it's challenging but i'm making progress.
2182	A: i assure you, i'm telling the truth. there are cockroaches in my room.
2183	A: the creditor's equity refers to liabilities in the balance sheet. in this case, it is $3,372,000.
2184	that works for me.
2185	correct, christmas is on december 25th.
2186	A: i'll process the refund for you now.
2187	A: it's a packed agenda, but yes, we'll cover it all in one afternoon.
2188	A: i'll take them.
2189	B: let me check the price of the standard toothbrushes, i'll bring them for you to examine.
2190	A: agreed, let's work towards a mutually beneficial resolution through negotiation.
2191	A: interesting, i only spoke of german and english. can you tell me which other languages you're fluent in besides french?
2192	B: it's on my bucket list too. enjoy your trip to japan!
2193	you can make an appointment with our housing coordinator to view the off-campus apartments listed in the catalog. their contact information is listed on the back cover of the catalog.
2194	A: the urgent remittance service with a 1% handling fee and 12 rmb express delivery fee will ensure the money reaches hangzhou within 2 hours for an account to individual transfer.
2195	yes, i'll sell you that ticket, sir. the total duration of the journey is approximately 11 hours and 40 minutes. would you like to add any extra services?
2196	A: thank you for your help. i'll get some more paper first.
2197	A: i see, you seem to make good use of your bank's various services. your travels require the use of many features, including atm withdrawals and foreign currency exchange. you've also mentioned direct debits and standing orders for convenience and cost savings. i wasn't aware you traded shares; that's an interesting approach to your savings and investments.
2198	B: i will double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.
2199	A: understood, your total comes out to $25.50. would you like to place an order for pick-up or for delivery?
2200	A: i'll have toast and tea then. (assuming a is making the decisions for both of them)
2201	A: it's best to check their website or call in advance to confirm if reservations are required.
2202	yes, it certainly seems that way based on what you've shared!
2203	B: i'd suggest checking the signage in aisle a for current sales.
2204	A: yes, you are entitled to fifteen days of paid annual leave and ten days of paid public holidays each year.
2205	thank you, i'm happy to help.
2206	B: our shop closes at 9 pm. please bring your receipt and the dress when you come.
2207	B: i'll make sure to bring any necessary materials and assist with setting up the presentation space at the dayton street office on thursday morning, aside from the display monitor.
2208	A: great to hear that! enjoy your new car.
2209	A: i'll try to make it then, thanks for offering.
2210	A: i'd take cold over this heat any day.
2211	B: i understand, but i still can't allow it. your safety is important to me. let's find a compromise that works for both of us.
2212	A: i'm sure it is, but we should be discreet. the historical significance is what matters most.
2213	yes, you could say that the organizational structure defines the shape and structure of a company.
2214	B: i can imagine. it's a tricky situation. maybe they should consider talking to hr for some guidance.
2215	it's reassuring to have a trusted ally like that.
2216	understood, ma'am. the box will be available for you until may 20th. please visit the counter to access its contents.
2217	B: wow, i had no idea it was that valuable.
2218	A: i believe you, dear. take care and feel better soon.
2219	A: he's new here, i suppose.
2220	A: of course, i'll hold it for you. let me know as soon as you've made a decision.
2221	A: i'll process your deposit application now. thank you for choosing us.
2222	A: the instalment amount would depend on the loan amount, interest rate, and repayment term you choose. i can provide you with a detailed calculation if you provide me with those details.
2223	i see. plum blossoms are beautiful in the snow as well. let's appreciate them together.
2224	A: you're welcome. here's the certificate for insurance reimbursement.
2225	A: no problem, have a good day.
2226	A: that's good to hear. enjoy your free time then.
2227	A: it's breathtaking. i can only imagine the beautiful sunrises and sunsets you must see every day.
2228	A: maybe you should attend more classes to help improve your understanding for the final.
2229	B: my pleasure. here's a number for a taxi company if you need it. good luck and safe travels!
2230	A: i'll see what can be arranged and get back to you as soon as possible.
2231	A: i see, let's look for a cheaper motel then.
2232	B: i'm sorry to hear that. is there anything i can help you with during this transitional period?
2233	A: i have, i'll do my best to prepare.
2234	A: that's a wise plan. good luck with your studying, b! let me know if you need any assistance.
2235	A: not a problem, i'll initiate the transfer now with the provided information. please provide the account number you'd like the funds transferred to as well.
2236	i agree, let's consider getting a car instead.
2237	A: i'll pass on the message. have a safe trip.
2238	A: i'll choose a different color then.
2239	A: you're welcome. have a great time at tiananmen square.
2240	by continuing to enjoy my work, learning new skills, and taking on new challenges to develop my career.
2241	A: i'm not sure, but it's important to him.
2242	i: how about trying the salmon instead? it's in season and considered a good alternative to swordfish.
2243	A: i forgot it once was an oversight, but twice is careless.
2244	A: i'll make some tea for us then.
2245	A: it's best to avoiding spreading unverified information. let's focus on more substantive conversations.
2246	B: no, it wasn't love at first sight for me. we became friends over time.
2247	i see. that will be a lengthy repair process. i recommend arranging for alternative transportation while we work on it.
2248	A: cushioned berths are more comfortable, but they cost more. ordinary berths are cheaper but still provide a good resting space. which would you prefer?
2249	A: yes, the coupon can be used at today's supermarket.
2250	B: i think john's success may be short-lived.
2251	B: sure, i'll have seconds as well, a.
2252	A: seven o'clock works for me. i'll prepare the necessary documents.
2253	A: i'd be happy to prove it. let's go to the haunted house next.
2254	it's unfortunate that tom continues to get into trouble and relies on his family for bail.
2255	A: that's a valid concern, protester. some argue that the bailout could prevent massive job losses and stabilize the industry. however, your point about executive compensation and excessive travel expenses is a significant issue for many americans.
2256	i'm glad to hear that. that's understanding of him.
2257	A: i'll take february 23 instead. thank you.
2258	i'll pass on the message that you'd like to apply for a proofreader position and request for your contact information for follow-up with the manager when he returns.
2259	A: i understand, but try to keep a positive attitude. let's focus on moving forward.
2260	B: really? in this context, you mean someone sold her personal information and then bought it back to drive up the price? that's despicable.
2261	B: that sounds exciting! i'll be there after school.
2262	A: i understand, but what are my options then?

2855	it's going to be a close call. let's give it our best shot.
2856	it seems the merger will bring a new name for the conglomerate company.

2888	A: it's growing steadily, thanks for asking. how about yours, louise?
2889	A: i see your point, but won't mandatory sick days lead to decreased productivity during their use and potential backlog of work?
2890	A: opportunities for growth and advancement, alignment with my career objectives, and a supportive work environment.
2891	B: i'm sorry to hear that, a. that's tough news. is there anything i can do to help?

2924	the nearest taxi stand is three blocks from here on elm street.

3045	A: scientific rigor comes from testing and evidence, b. the big bang theory has been supported by numerous observations and experiments, such as the cosmic microwave background radiation and the abundance of light elements.
3046	i understand your reservations, but perhaps considering the benefits and the expertise of a qualified practitioner could help alleviate your fears. alternatively, there are other traditional chinese medicine techniques that might be more appealing to you, such as herbal remedies or massage.
3047	it's potentially feasible, but we'd need to consider some details and potential challenges first.
3048	A: great choice. i'll get the process started for a usd account then. please provide some identification and complete the necessary forms.
3049	A: yes, i'm positive. carl will be turning fifty next month.

3053	understood, i'll purchase two full fare tickets then.

3070	A: thank you. the green sweater is $80? i'll think about it.

3072	A: that's correct, 3600 seconds in an hour. is that all the questions for now?
3073	i'll do my best to take a shorter route. let's go.
3074	yes, "the terminator" is a sci-fi movie. however, everyone has different preferences when it comes to film genres. just because you enjoy "the terminator" doesn't mean that b has to like all sci-fi movies.
3075	yes, we are planning to see each other again soon.
3076	A: that could be an effective strategy, but it might require international cooperation and strong enforcement.
3077	A: i'm glad you're here now despite the rain. it must have been quite a wait for you.
3078	A: i know, it's been a long time. (or) i see, that's a lot of time invested. (or) five hoursstraight? that's exhausting. (or) i'm feeling the toll of it now. (any of these responses should suffice as a concise continuation.)
3079	A: i'm not discounting human capabilities. let's keep an open mind about both ancient civilizations and otherworldly possibilities.
3080	B: we have lids available for that pan. shall i get a size to match?
3081	A: i'm just voicing an opinion, it's not a certainty.
3082	that sounds great, alex. i'd love to try it out sometime.
3083	B: i'm ready for the added responsibilities that come with the new title. thank you for the trust and confidence placed in me.

3086	B: alright, i'll speak with roger about it. thank you, a.
3087	i'll call back then. thank you.
3088	A: that's risky. if jim can't pay on time, things could get worse.
3089	A: here are some leather belts that have a casual yet dressy look. which one would you prefer?
3090	A: i understand your concern, but trust in your daughter's ability to make her own decisions. it's a crucial part of growing up.
3091	A: absolutely, sir. you might enjoy our roasted crispy chicken or the spicy beef. both are popular sichuan dishes with distinct flavors.
3092	A: i know, it's strange. perhaps something else is bothering her.
3093	A: you're just putting it off. let's do it now.
3094	A: here's your postage amount, 30 yuan.
3095	A: agreed. let's ensure a balanced presentation during mr. chandler's visit.
3096	A: i'm sorry, i only have larger bills on me. you might want to try asking someone else if they have some small change for the pay phone.
3097	A: is there anything new in the fridge then?
3098	B: that's an unsettling thought. let's leave before we're discovered.

3133	A: that sounds like an exciting adventure! i'd be open to trying it out and experiencing your family culture.
3134	i've had some experience with french cuisine, but i'm open to trying new dishes as well.

3151	B: i'm heading to the grocery store.
3152	A: i'll make sure to prepare that for you promptly. enjoy your meal.
3153	B: no, it's not taken. you're welcome to sit down.
3154	B: i didn't consider the train option, i'll look into it.
3155	A: i understand, it's not everyone's cup of tea. maybe some hot tea could help you feel better instead?

3177	sure thing, take your time.
3178	B: your imagination knows no bounds, a. (note: the conversation seems to be light-hearted and playful in nature. a is trying to find a piece of paper for her binder and found one that fits perfectly onto b's oily face. both a and b are using humor to express their thoughts, with no ill intentions.)
3179	A: i'm glad to hear that. it must be wonderful to spend time with such loving grandparents.

3228	B: the doctor is still running tests to determine the cause of her illness.
3229	A: i guess we'll see. (assuming a is expressing skepticism about b's assertion that the person in question will get married by the end of the month, given that they currently do not have a girlfriend. a's response implies a doubt that the marriage will actually happen based on the available information.)
3230	A: i'm sorry, but with only 415.2 rmb, the hard sleeper ticket is still out of reach. you may need to find an alternative way to get to shanghai.

3246	A: i'll be more careful, mom. thank you for reminding me.
3247	i see. tom's feelings towards jenny's brother seem complex then. your quote suggests he has mixed feelings towards jenny and her brother. as for your statement, "love me, love my dog," it's an interesting phrase, but it doesn't directly respond to tom's attitude towards jenny's brother.

3277	B: i can have the check certified if that is required.
3278	A: we have kangaroo with marsala sauce or emu with pepperberry sauce. which one would you prefer, ma'am?

3289	B: i consider their reputation, alignment with my values, and potential for mutual growth.
3290	A: of course, smile for the camera! (while taking a picture of b and lisa)
3291	B: that's a nice bike! how old were you when you got it?
3292	A: thank you, but i cannot accept that as well. you're being too generous.
3293	i have a husband, a child, and two parents. (assuming this is the standard interpretation of "four people" in a nuclear family)
3294	A: i see. you have a background in sales.
3295	B: my apologies for the inconvenience. i'll arrange for a new room and process your refund immediately. no need for evidence, consider it our issue to resolve.
3296	B: we'll see if that's possible. i'll check with the printer.

3312	A: yes, i'll be there.
3313	A: i see where you're coming from. the series sheds light on the issue. unfortunately, the demand is high, but the supply is insufficient.

3559	A: yes, it's breathtaking. let's take it all in before it disappears completely.
3560	A: in go, capturing is a tactical consideration, not the primary goal. the focus is on surrounding and isolating your opponent's stones to eventually claim more territories. it's more about strategy and subtlety.

3571	B: i agree, they've put up a strong fight.
3572	yes, that's unfortunate. he likely realizes the error of his actions now.
3573	A: i'm not holding a gun. i just needed clarity. you love me? b: yes, i do. i love you and think you're awesome.
3574	A: yes, i can handle the minor discomfort of acupuncture for seven days if it may help alleviate your pain.

3587	A: i'll consider your explanation later then. (assuming a is willing to let the topic drop for now)
3588	i do, but not to the extent that mr. smith goes on about them.
3589	A: thank you, have a good trip. (gives b some change)
3590	it's fascinating where things have been before they came to us.
3591	A: seven works for me. see you then.
3592	A: i'll consider it, but you need to make up for your mistake first. in the meantime, let me discuss your proposal with tom.
3593	sure, here's a's response: "yes, i'd be happy to let you pass it over so i can give it a try."
3594	yes, i genuinely think you deserve the promotion, a. congratulations once again.

3602	A: finishing up here, i'll be right with you.
3603	A: i'm glad you think so, b. tom's discovery has certainly caused a stir.
3604	it's looking promising, but it's still early in the season. let's hope for the best!

3606	B: my long-term goal is to continue advancing my career in finance and accounting, ultimately holding a senior leadership position.
3607	A: i know, it will help reduce the swelling and pain.
3608	let's start planning and book our hawaii tour together.
3609	A: you're welcome, ms. b. have a great day and i hope you find a unit that suits your needs. let me know if you have any other questions.
3610	B: it's generally not necessary to inform your bank until you have a signed contract.
3611	A: i hope your recovery goes smoothly.
3612	i'll be there. see you then.
3613	i don't swim here personally, but i know my mother enjoys it.

3626	i understand your grief is deep and ongoing. i'm here for you if you need to talk.
3627	i'll see what i can do to expedite the process for you. three days instead of seven it is.
3628	A: i understand, kate. take the day off if you need it. i'll handle the reports myself.
3629	i'll make the call and get back to you.
3630	A: i'll be careful with my words.
3631	A: i see. your car must be well prepared then.
3632	i understand your perspective, but his inconsistent attendance and work habits are concerning. i'll bring this up with him and see if we can't improve his reliability and focus on client interactions instead of social media during work hours.

3807	A: i understand. take care of yourself and get well soon. let your team know about your absence.
3808	B: no, a single ticket is valid for transfers within a certain amount of time. check the ticket for specific details.
3809	i love you too, happy anniversary, a. we've come a long way together.

3816	i'll begin by documenting the financial sheets for the recent business transaction.

3818	A: the shallow area is only 1.4 meters deep, madam. lockers are free and located over there.

3939	A: understood. let's review your credit report and financials for the loan decision.

3941	tomorrow night works for me.
3942	A: i'm glad you asked. our shortbread comes in various sizes, but smaller packages are more popular in your market. feel free to taste the sample i've prepared. our shortbread is known for its exceptional quality.
3943	A: that's affordable, i'll look for a convenience store nearby to get a local sim card.
3944	A: we're cutting it close. the train leaves in 10 minutes.
3945	i understand, a. i'll make sure to bring the note to professor li for you. good luck with your decision regarding the student government.

3964	i will ensure better packaging for future shipments. apologies for the inconvenience caused.

3968	A: i'm glad to hear that. good luck with your studying, b.
3969	A: i see, thank you for the information. i'll bring some change with me.

3973	B: it's fascinating how engaged they both are in their digital worlds.
3974	A: i understand your frustration, but i'll look for alternative accommodations in the future.
3975	B: yes, sir. we have trainers available for an additional fee. you can make an appointment at the front desk.
3976	i try to understand their perspective and communicate effectively with them, finding common ground and collaborating on solutions to any issues that may arise.
3977	A: i see. that does seem impressive, but i'll need to consider other factors before making a decision. thanks for the information.
3978	i understand the pressure you're under, but maybe considering a short break could help you recharge and come back to your work with renewed energy.
3979	A: we're more than willing to offer you a competitive price for the eight megapixel cameras, angela. let's discuss the details of the increased order and the possible cost savings.

3987	i will attend the wedding on may 1st, at 9:00 pm. i'm delighted for you both and wish you a happy marriage. best wishes to john as well.
3988	B: that's surprising. i guess there are still many who prefer faster and more convenient options.
3989	A: absolutely, it's a game-changer for both personal use and commerce. companies can reach a larger audience, and consumers have more choices and information at their fingertips.
3990	i have some large trousers you might be interested in.
3991	A: i see, it was a draw then. i agree, ac milan's defense looked stronger during the match.
3992	B: i see. financial difficulties, then.
3993	it's not my place to interfere in your personal decisions, but you may want to consider discussing this with your parents before making any drastic changes.
3994	A: i see, thank you. that's the route to the nearest gas station.
3995	based on my knowledge, queen street can lead to city hall, but there might be other routes as well. i would recommend checking a map or asking someone else for the most direct route.
3996	B: i'm sorry, i have a prior commitment this afternoon. let's try to find another time that works for both of us.
3997	A: i can see that. enjoy your new ride.

4000	A: yes, let's file a claim as soon as possible.
4001	A: i'd love to, but i don't have the luxury of a television at home. enjoy the documentary!
4002	A: this address please, sir. (to b)
4003	A: i cannot waive the fine without the officer present. however, since no fine was issued on the spot and you were not officially charged, you do not need to pay anything at this time.
4004	i'm sorry for any confusion, but i don't believe i have the meeting report you're asking about, a. you may want to check with the person who was in charge of compiling it.
4005	potential side effects may include dizziness, headache, and upset stomach. please consult the prescription label or speak with your doctor for a comprehensive list.
4006	that's an efficient solution. i've heard of corn drying methods, but this one is new to me.
4007	B: i was just noticing her necklace, it's quite beautiful.
4008	i'm interested in placing an order for your exported cloth. could you provide me with your pricing and minimum order quantities?
4009	my parents are also preparing for the move. they're excited but understandably anxious as well. we're all in this together.
4010	A: we'll discuss the details of your starting date during negotiations.
4011	A: no, just the cheeseburger and fries you mentioned. i'll place your order now.
4012	A: the steak comes with a side of french fries and a choice of two vegetables: broccoli or green beans. let me know which one you'd prefer.
4013	A: that's a significant increase, is there a less expensive solution?
4014	B: i'm glad you're considering a more conversational approach. it may help him understand better.
4015	i completely agree, his performance in the pk round was exceptional and deserve the win.
4016	A: yes, both are important to prepare for the interview. you can start by researching the company and updating your cv.
4017	A: got it. i'll position myself and make sure everyone is ready. just give us a signal when you're ready to take the photo, b.
4018	A: i'm glad to hear that you found the course beneficial. i'm here to help you out as well. let me know if you have any questions or need any assistance.
4019	B: i'll make sure to reserve a smoking table for 7:00 p.m. for you, sir.
4020	B: i pivoted to hairdressing for financial stability and found a passion in it.
4021	A: i completely understand. honesty is important for building trust in any relationship. good luck with your new friend!
4022	A: thank you, that's helpful. i appreciate it. (or) great, that's not far. i'll be there soon.
4023	yes, there were various animals living in the forest.
4024	B: of course, a. please come over when you're finished here.
4025	B: that's still not enough for us to consider making a purchase. we appreciate your effort, but we'll need to look elsewhere for a more competitive price.
4026	sure, shogun it is! i'll make a reservation.
4027	A: got it, b. i'll inform mr. green of the rescheduled appointment if he calls in.
4028	A: thank you, natasha. i'm glad that you all had a great time together during the visit.
4029	thank you for your order, sir. room service will deliver a hamburger and a cup of coffee to room 402 shortly.
4030	yes, you can purchase the tickets for tarzan for tomorrow. the price is 35 yuan each for the front seats. you have tickets for 7:30 pm tonight.
4031	B: i'll ask and find out for you.
4032	A: that's bold! best of luck with your new venture.
4033	A: that's an ambitious goal, but it would require significant advancements in technology and our understanding of mars.
4034	sure, let's do that. i'll bring some sunscreen.
4035	B: you could prioritize your tasks and see which one is more important or urgent. then, communicate with the school and see if you can reschedule the classes for a later date.
4036	B: we apologize for the inconvenience, sir. we'll ensure you're relocated promptly to a cockroach-free room and process your refund.
4037	A: yes, there is a handling fee for the deposit certification service. the amount will be specified on the form you'll be given. please sign here and here before we proceed.
4038	that sounds great! let's head there then. i'm hoping the spicy food will help.
4039	you're welcome. enjoy your stay at the star hotel.
4040	i will, thank you for the caution. have a great dinner with your husband.
4041	A: understood, chinese food will be delivered to room 204, mr. white. thank you for your order.
4042	great idea, looking forward to the dinner thursday after the weekly meeting. i'll make sure everyone is informed. it's been a while since our last department dinner.
4043	A: i understand, elvin. let's focus on our task. stars.com comes first.
4044	A: i understand the situation, but i need to consider my own financial needs. i will submit my resignation effective two weeks from now.
4045	B: i have several years of practical experience in the field.
4046	A: something like lifting weights or going for a run.
4047	A: of course, feel free to check it out.
4048	A: i respect your decision. good luck with your music teaching career, b.
4049	A: yes, a glass of horchata or a margarita to go with your burrito and nachos?
4050	A: great, i will confirm your appointment with a phone call the day before, mr. horn. see you then.
4051	yes, it is. i enjoyed the ambiance.
4052	A: perhaps she sees it as a practical decision then.
4053	A: oh, i saw elvin earlier. thanks for letting me know about vince and the deal with homesupplies.com.
4054	A: great, i'll process your upgrade now. you should receive your new platinum moneylink card in the mail within a week. enjoy the additional benefits!
4055	A: i'll keep that in mind.
4056	B: i'll need to check with the team and see if we can make those arrangements. i'll get back to you as soon as possible.
4057	A: your receipt is in the email linked to your email address. enjoy your purchase!
4058	yes, i have a list with all their contact information.
4059	B: i agree, let's ask the teacher if we can have an extension.
4060	B: not off the top of my head, but we could also research other reputable headhunting firms in your industry for comparison.
4061	B: i'm not sure, it could have fallen out at home or in the garden. i've been checking both places but can't find it.
4062	you're welcome, have a great day! (a)
4063	i see. i'll check if there are any tickets available on the 21st, thank you.
4064	A: great, i'd be happy to arrange a meeting to discuss the details. b: let's schedule a call or video conference to discuss further.
4065	A: lithium-ion, mainly.
4066	B: unfortunately, they can be quite resourceful.
4067	A: i can imagine how frustrating that must be. is there anything i can help you do about it?
4068	A: i had a late dinner before leaving for the airport. how is your flight now? no more issues, i hope?
4069	A: we have a good selection of local teas and beverages. would you like to try one?
4070	A: i appreciate your enthusiasm, but i'll pass on the piano classes for now.
4071	A: no, it's not an olympic sport for individuals, but it is included in the summer olympics for team events.
4072	A: that's a valid concern, b. you might want to do some additional research to ensure the authenticity of the reviews.
4073	i'll email you the application link. please complete it and we'll review your eligibility promptly.
4074	A: i'm glad you came out despite feeling tired. let's try again another time when you're more rested.
4075	mr. smith, i'll make sure you get a good look at your resume as soon as possible. thank you for bringing an extra copy.

4077	i'll show you the kenmore refrigerator with the ice maker, water dispenser, and ample interior space. follow me.
4078	B: i've given it some thought, but i haven't decided on a specific country yet. i'll research and make a decision as i explore the double major option.
4079	B: i'm here to help. good luck with your first voting experience!
4080	B: li attempts another serve. it's a good one, but brazil's libero makes a brilliant save. the crowd is going wild!
4081	B: i'll use my credit card or contactless payment if necessary.
4082	A: i see. joanna is the one with college aspirations.
4083	A: alright, i will ask alice for help. thanks, b.
4084	B: understood. i'llmake sure to consider your strengths and weaknesses during the selection process.
4085	A: i'll arrange for the faucet to be fixed as soon as possible.
4086	A: yes, i hadn't known that. your lady's voice is truly enchanting.
4087	B: thank you. (allowing a to help with bags)
4088	A: agreed, let's inform the waiter about the dry chicken, overcooked fish, and mushy vegetables.
4089	B: no, i've moved on from that. it's the crowds and small talk that i can't stand.
4090	A: i'll look into applying for grants or financial aid as soon as possible. thank you for the suggestion.
4091	B: i see. please let me know if it's comfortable and if you'd like to try any other sizes.
4092	A: our office at 123 main st. please come 15 minutes early.
4093	A: i understand your concern, but i need to prioritize my spot on the baseball team now. i'll make it up to you by giving you my best chess game later this week.
4094	A: i see. it's a tough decision, but prioritizing health is important.
4095	i'm a large size 10. thanks for asking.
4096	B: i'll discuss the salary adjustement with management. we'll see what we can do. meanwhile, your new responsibilities will take effect next week.
4097	yes, there were various animals living in the forest among the trees.
4098	A: start small, find a workout routine that suits you, and gradually build up your fitness level. it's never too late to make a change.
4099	A: i agree, b. it's time for some clear communication and boundaries.
4100	A: i'll demonstrate for you, madam. (demonstrates setting the alarm on the watch)
4101	A: i'm here if you need to talk, nancy. it's okay to feel sad. a boyfriend may not be everything, but he's an important part of your life. it will get better with time.
4102	the tram stop is a few blocks from here, near the park. (assuming a and b are currently located at a bus stop and a wants to go to the grand hotel.)
4103	A: please hand me your driver's license to complete the rental agreement.
4104	A: that's still closer than risking getting swept away here. let's go.
4105	A: you're welcome, feel free to message me whenever you'd like to chat. enjoy your new online connections!
4106	i'll print them as soon as i receive the files.
4107	A: i understand. please feel free to ask if you have any further questions or concerns. i'll be here if you need me.
4108	great, i'll make sure to mark down the 9th for melissa's birthday party. looking forward to the mexican dinner and dancing!
4109	i'm sorry to hear that. you could try sending the fax as an email attachment instead or using a cloud-based fax service if you have access to one. if neither of those options work, you may need to wait until the office is open to use the boss's fax machine or seek assistance from a nearby business or service center. good luck.
4110	i see, i'll do that now.
4111	that's thoughtful of you, a. i'm sure your brother would appreciate the surprise. go ahead and make the trip next weekend.
4112	that sounds like a lovely place. i'm excited for you and your family to start making memories there. enjoy settling in!
4113	A: alright then, here's your check. enjoy the rest of your meal.
4114	that's an interesting perspective, mary. maybe finding a good balance is the key?
4115	B: that young french man's courage is truly inspiring. his determination to face his fear and jump despite the nervousness speaks volumes.
4116	A: may is doing well too. i'll have her give you a call soon.
4117	A: i'll need to check your passport details for the booking. please present it to me.
4118	that could be an interesting experience! let's plan it out.
4119	we're utilizing education and training programs, as well as targeted marketing campaigns, to enhance product knowledge in europe.
4120	i understand your sentiment, a. it can be disappointing when the weather isn't what we hope for.
4121	B: congratulations! that's wonderful news.
4122	i understand, a. i'll try to keep that in mind. thank you for your support.
4123	A: i believe in you. good luck presenting your friendly side tomorrow.

4127	A: good luck at practice, john. look forward to the game against the rockets.
4128	A: thank you, i will do that.
4129	A: i'd be happy to dance the waltz with you.
4130	B: i'm glad you think so, a. the recipe called for white wine in the sauce for the chicken.
4131	it's going well so far. i'm learning a lot and finding it very helpful for my career goals.
4132	A: you're right, carl won those events in 1984. michael johnson was the first to achieve the 200/400 double in the same olympics in 1996.
4133	yes, the bus station is nearby.
4134	A: i'll choose airmail then, thank you. (Â£10 please.)
4135	A: of course, i'll help you with that.
4136	A: i'm willing to learn and put in the effort. my uncle's guidance has given me a good foundation.
4137	thank you, b. i'm excited for this new opportunity.
4138	B: that's not a real thing, is it? a: it's not scientifically proven.
4139	great, i look forward to seeing you at the final interview on monday at 10am in the hr manager's office. have a good weekend. bye.
4140	i'm sure they will be, congratulations again!
4141	B: i'll be right back with it, sir.
4142	A: of course, please wait a moment while i retrieve a size 40 shirt for you. you may try it on in the fitting room over there.
4143	B: you can check the unemployment website for a benefits calculator or contact your state's unemployment office for information on your potential benefits.
4144	i'll be happy to review your report in detail when i have some time. thank you for your hard work. goodbye. (b)
4145	A: i'll be here. stay safe. (as b goes to move the car)
4146	sure, i'd be happy to help you look at apartments during my free time. let's plan to check out some of the listings this weekend.
4147	A: i can see why. skiing and vegas are both exciting experiences.
4148	B: how about trying calvin klein or h&m for more affordable options?
4149	sure, i'd be happy to play tennis with you some time, pete. let's arrange a date and time that works for both of us.
4150	A: i'll make it work for 9 then. let's move forward.
4151	B: yes, barbara was likely doing yoga, a practice originating from india.
4152	A: great, looking forward to it, b. see you at the conference.
4153	B: it's often cheaper and more convenient. you can download individual tracks instead of an entire album, and have the music instantly available on your device.
4154	A: understood, no problem. thanks for letting me know.
4155	A: i see. i'll try to be on time this time.
4156	B: yes, it sounds exciting! let's start the game.
4157	A: i'll give you the $55 then.
4158	sure thing, have a good night.
4159	A: i see. in that case, there's no need for a reservation then. seats are available on a first-come, first-served basis.
4160	A: i'll reach out to them immediately. good luck with your job search.
4161	A: have a safe journey, mr. martin. farewell.
4162	A: understood. thank you for the clarification.
4163	A: yes, that will be all for now. let me grab the perfume for you.
4164	A: yes, the estimated arrival time has been delayed by two hours. please call back in an hour for any updates.
4165	A: no, i believe that covers your question about overdraft fees. let me know if you have any other inquiries.
4166	that's great to hear, a. in addition to being hard-working, your fluency in english and italian would be very useful for communication with international clients or colleagues.
4167	B: yes, it took me several attempts before i was able to quit permanently.
4168	A: maybe next time, i'll join you. i'd love to try jogging on the beach too.
4169	B: i apologize, i'll get that replaced with a fresh, hot one for you right away.
4170	B: i'd rather not get involved in name-calling. let's focus on finding a solution that benefits everyone involved.
4171	A: understood, i'll pass the message on to our accounts team and they'll contact you tomorrow.
4172	that's great to hear, a. enjoy your vacation later this month!
4173	A: i can imagine how those experiences shaped your perspective. it's fascinating how working in a charity organization can bring about such profound personal growth.
4174	A: yes, i do have some ketchup.
4175	B: i apologize for the error, sir. i'll correct it right away. here's your corrected bill.
4176	B: alright, i can lend you some records for that time frame.
4177	A: maybe we should focus on finding things to try to eat instead of buying more to bring back.
4178	A: nanjing road, near the theater. that's where our store is located.
4179	A: you're welcome, kevin. look forward to seeing you on thursday at 9:30 am at 345 stony creek avenue.
4180	A: really? i didn't realize you were wearing it.
4181	i see. make sure to keep applying the lotion and take the antihistamine as prescribed. let me know if you need any additional assistance or if your condition worsens. stay hydrated and try to avoid scratching to prevent spreading the rash. rest and recover well, malia.
4182	i'll keep the room dark and cool to help you relax, a. goodnight.
4183	A: i see, each season has its unique charm, doesn't it? spring marks the end of the academic year for you.
4184	B: i see, i'll make adjustments to align with the client's requests.
4185	both methods have their advantages. bus may be more convenient for exploring multiple sites, while biking allows for more freedom and exercise. which one do you prefer?
4186	B: i have concerns about the potential risks and uncertainties involved.
4187	A: i'm glad to hear that. keep practicing and improving!
4188	A: i understand your perspective, but to some, the quality and design justify the cost.
4189	i'd be happy to help you with your job search, ethan. let me know if there's anything specific i can do to assist you.
4190	B: the clubs in japan have a unique atmosphere with a strong focus on technology and visual effects, which creates an immersive experience. in contrast, london clubs are known for their diverse crowds and live music scene.
4191	based on your order of 900 dozen, i will calculate the total cost and get back to you shortly.
4192	i'd be happy to help you find the periodicals section. let's go together.
4193	that's a great alternative, b. i'll give it a try. thank you for the recommendation.
4194	great! i'll navigate us there then.
4195	A: no, i'd rather not. i'll bring the sunblock.
4196	nice talking to you too, b. take care. have a great shopping trip.
4197	B: i understand various dialects, but i speak mandarin with a shanghainese accent.

4225	A: i hope you're planning to teach them then.
4226	B: i'm sure it's grateful for your kindness. cats can be quite loyal once they trust you.
4227	A: i'll have to check with my supervisor before approving that charge. can i have your contact information to follow up on this?
4228	A: that was an unusual choice for a formal event.
4229	A: i'm glad you could make it, anna. happy birthday in advance!
4230	A: glad you reacted quickly. the boy was unaware of his surroundings.

4236	understood, please make sure you handle the video carefully to avoid any damages.
4237	B: that's likely from the fried chicken or qu jung you see over there. it's a popular snack during the festival.

4254	A: sure thing, let's find another time then.
4255	B: yes, i know a couple who met on eharmony and have been happily married for over a decade. they lived in different states when they first connected and built a strong relationship online before meeting in person. their story is just one example of successful online dating.

4263	A: great! here's a quick summary: tom hanks plays an airport official who falls in love with a ukranian immigrant, amelia, played by catherine zeta-jones, while they're both stuck in an airport terminal due to immigration issues. their unique bond helps them navigate the challenges they face.
4264	A: sure, she's the woman in the middle with the red scarf.
4265	A: i see, you prefer cooler weather then.
4266	A: great, i'll give you five dollars for it then.

4270	A: here's your change, thank you.
4271	B: i'm sorry for your loss.
4272	A: i should have been more cautious.
4273	i agree, the acting didn't stand out.
4274	that's nice to hear about your gardening hobby, a. it's peaceful and rewarding, isn't it?
4275	i understand. it's not easy adjusting to new work environments. keep pushing through, you'll get used to it.
4276	you're welcome, feel free to ask if you have any other questions or if there's anything else i can assist you with while you're making your decision.
4277	A: sure, i'd be happy to assign you a new room, mr. wang. please wait a moment while i find an available one for you.
4278	A: here you go, try this one instead.
4279	A: understood, i'll avoid those activities.
4280	A: sure, let's invite tom to join in on the fun. even if he's out of tune, it'll make for a good time.
4281	A: here's the check for the watch you chose.
4282	B: some of my favorite authors include alexander dumas, nelson demille, and albert camus. they provide a great balance of historical fiction and insightful perspectives.
4283	A: thank you, i'll have a black coffee. (waits for mr. thomas' call)
4284	A: i'll bring your change and chicken nuggets as soon as your fries are ready.

4289	B: that's impressive. must have been a great find!
4290	i found some issues with the roof and electrical wiring that need attention.
4291	A: sounds good, mary. i look forward to it. bye.
4292	B: then i'll do them instead. no problem.
4293	A: of course, please follow me to the fitting room.
4294	A: i'll pass on the waltz for now. let's get back to disco dancing when the music speeds up.
4295	A: i understand, but my parents value their peace and security. i'll manage.

4304	A: i see, i pressed the wrong button then. thanks for your help.
4305	B: have a safe journey, a. bye.
4306	i'll make sure to keep that in mind, thanks for the reminder.
4307	B: that's a valid point, but cutting off financial support could also negatively impact the civilian population and potentially worsen the situation. diplomacy and peaceful negotiations remain the most effective solutions.
4308	A: i see. golf and figure skating then, you mentioned. quite an eclectic mix.
4309	A: i'm glad to hear that! enjoy your trip.
4310	A: i understand your perspective, sharon, but i'm not used to this kind of scene. i think i'll head home now.
4311	yes, shogun sounds like a great option for japanese food on your birthday.
4312	A: absolutely, we can accommodate that. let's measure your waist with some extra allowance for the holidays. for your inseam, could you please stand up and lift one leg up to your hip? let me get an accurate measurement there as well.
4313	B: thanks, you too, a. enjoy yours!
4314	A: yes, please sign the acknowledgment form for the received documents.
4315	A: hi lucy, i'll pass on your message to mr. doff. bye for now.

4319	B: i'll finish my homework first, grandma.

4322	B: i understand, let's try to catch it and get it out as soon as possible. bring some paper plates and a broom.
4323	A: it might be best to assess the injury further before deciding on treatment. let's try to make you comfortable first and then evaluate the extent of the damage.
4324	A: i hope the new job brings him productivity.
4325	A: that's wonderful news, betty. goodbye.
4326	A: i will, that will be one dollar and seventy-five cents.

4328	A: thanks, you too. b: appreciate it.
4329	A: i agree, at least cold weather comes with the promise of snow and holidays.
4330	i'm sorry for the inconvenience. i had a family emergency to attend to.
4331	A: interested, but my schedule is tight starting september 2nd. let's arrange a meeting at my place this saturday before noon.
4332	i'd be happy to help you find the lunch room, a. it's usually located near the building's main entrance or in the basement level. let me help you get there.
4333	A: i'll go alone then.
4334	A: the processing time usually takes a few weeks. please pay the required fee and submit the completed application and other documents.

4337	B: no problem, please take your time to retrieve it.
4338	i'll pick up some cold medicine for you on the way home. get plenty of rest, b. feeling better soon!
4339	A: i had no idea. it must have been a shock to richard.
4340	you can check local events listings or online directories for flea markets in your area. some take place regularly, while others are one-time events. you may also want to ask around in your community for recommendations.
4341	A: a pencil would be acceptable.
4342	A: here's your hard seat ticket for the 10:30 train to new york city, $6.
4343	it's approximately a 5-minute walk.
4344	the cost of insuring a package for $20 through airmail can vary. i would suggest checking with your postal service for an exact price.
4345	A: thank you for suggesting that, i will add medicines to my list.
4346	i'm sorry to hear that, a. i hope everything goes well with your grandpa. take care.
4347	A: thank you for bringing the returned book and for your selections. the new books are due in two weeks. have a nice day.
4348	i'll get you a cup of black tea and a strawberry tart.
4349	B: no problem, but be more careful next time butting up against those bushes.
4350	we're in for a treat with designs from shanghai and new york. let's enjoy the show and be prepared to make some purchases.
4351	A: i see. how about we compromise and explore venice by boat during the day and then spend some time in greece for the cultural experiences?
4352	sure, the bar near the beach it is. see you tomorrow.
4353	A: i've got it covered.
4354	that's impressive, b. based on your education and certifications, i'll consider your application further. let me follow up with you soon.
4355	B: i'm not sure, a. let's try to find out by asking her directly or gathering more information.
4356	A: i'm sorry, i'll make a new one with the specified material and color right away.
4357	A: i'd appreciate it, thank you.
4358	sure thing, no smoking table by the window for mr. wang's party of three. enjoy your evening.

4365	A: i'm looking forward to it, ms. thou. let's discuss potential partnership opportunities.
4366	A: here, take these with you. stay dry! bye, sara. see you soon.
4367	A: i'd prefer to look into balcony seats instead.
4368	A: i see, so it's solids and stripes first, then the 8-ball.
4369	A: i understand your concern, but i find value in my online connections. it's not just about the time and money, it's about the human connection.
4370	it's regarding a timely matter that requires his immediate attention, a. i can't share the details over the phone, but please make a note and ask him to call as soon as possible.
4371	A: i believed it was just for high school students. b: this one's for alumni as well.

4373	A: i'd love to join you there some day. b: absolutely, you're welcome to come along.
4374	i'll make a hundred and sixty copies, no problem. let me know if you need anything else.

4378	thank you, b. i appreciate your kind words. i'm excited to dive deeper into mahjong and master its rules. let's learn together!
4379	A: i understand, please come back with payment when you have it ready.
4380	it depends on the terms of your insurance, please check with the hotel to confirm.
4381	A: that's correct. offering you more stock options is a way to keep ownership percentage while raising funds.
4382	A: i'll suggest herbal tea or green tea as alternatives. you might find they provide similar benefits without the caffeine.
4383	A: i'll look for the double doors, professor. see you at three.
4384	A: i need to use the restroom then. we can make a quick stop.
4385	A: thank you, b. we're enjoying our new journey together.
4386	A: fair enough, let's make it a rule to check prices before making purchases.
4387	let's head to the parking lot first, bart. i'll help you with the bags. (as you both make your way to the parking lot)
4388	B: you can find the claim form at the baggage claim office.
4389	A: i cannot condone physical violence or force against my child. instead, i may try to find other ways to communicate effectively and understand his perspective.
4390	A: you're welcome, mr. green. i look forward to discussing your application further with my team. we'll be in touch next week.
4391	A: it's not about elvin or dave, b. i have my suspicions about someone else on the team.
4392	A: that's an option i've considered as well.
4393	B: i see, so you believe ac milan has an edge in ball control.
4394	B: (laughs) i'm joking, a. i trust you completely.
4395	i'll find that information for you. gate no. 2, please. (b)
4396	B: the pay is okay.
4397	B: i see. then who caused the damage?
4398	B: it's just a rug, it can be cleaned. no need to worry too much about it.
4399	A: here you go, please feel free to try it on.
4400	sure thing, a. i'll head over to help you with the fax machine.
4401	B: i'll have to take your word for it.
4402	A: yes, let's keep the friendship, but let's give ourselves some space for now.
4403	A: i didn't know you owned a lizard. fascinating! (b holds out the lizard for a to take a closer look.) a: i've never held one before. it's amazing!
4404	A: i hadn't thought about that. how convenient!
4405	i'm interested to find out as well. keep me updated.
4406	A: a cold-wave perm, please.
4407	A: yes, that's correct. the sooner you repay the loan, the less interest you'll pay. welcome, and feel free to come in or call back when you're ready to proceed.
4408	A: i see. we have different preferences then.
4409	B: i'll try to make it then, but i can only stay for an hour.
4410	A: i see, time and convenience seem to be key advantages for you.
4411	B: some sounds can be challenging for native spanish speakers, but with practice, it becomes easier.
4412	i'm unable to make reservations for you here, but the sunset hotel is nearby and may have availability. you could try contacting them.
4413	A: i understand, it's a difficult decision. you can explore both options before making a choice.
4414	sure, 11:30 it is. let's make it a lunch meeting.
4415	A: you're welcome, jack. i'm glad i could help. the crystal chandelier and new drapes are excellent ideas for your living room. i also think a fresh coat of paint in a neutral color for the den would complement the grandfather clock well. as for the dining room, adding some leafy green plants can bring a nice touch of nature indoors.
4416	i'd be happy to go with you to the bookshop.
4417	A: we'll consider a car wash and candy sales, thank you.
4418	B: it varies, but on average, around fifteen minutes. i often spend time considering what matching clothes i have, what's comfortable and presentable for the day's schedule, and what goes well with my current mood. sometimes it takes longer if i'm indecisive or if i need to iron an outfit.
4419	A: i appreciate your help. i'll do that.
4420	A: home run! what a game, bob!
4421	A: you go ahead.
4422	yes, next time i'll be more careful. i didn't mean to sign up for a recurring order.
4423	A: depends on the weather and my work schedule. i'll let you know if i can make it.
4424	B: i would be glad to try it. thank you.
4425	that's a good suggestion, b. a rug could be a cost-effective option for updating the bedroom's look.
4426	A: i see. thanks for the update. let me check the forecast for tomorrow as well.
4427	A: very well, mr. rodgers. enjoy your stay at mansion hotel. george will be with you shortly to assist you with your luggage and show you to your room. let me know if you need anything else.
4428	the cost for excess baggage will depend on the airline's fees. please check with the airline representative for an exact amount.
4429	A: no problem reported, sharon. thank you for bringing it to my attention. i'll look into it further.
4430	B: i don't have feelings for jack in that way.
4431	i'll see what i can do to expedite the process, but i can't make any guarantees. your order will be prioritized, and i'll let you know as soon as it's ready.
4432	A: the limousine service from the airport to the hotel will cost one hundred and eighty yuan. is that acceptable?
4433	great, i'll make arrangements for an interview time. please hold on while i check my schedule.
4434	A: i'll cook dinner then. let's go to the disco after that. (b's response implied that she doesn't want to sit and talk, and also raised the concern of who will cook dinner, so a addresses both issues in one response.)
4435	A: i understand, but let's focus on getting out safely first. we'll deal with your belongings later. follow me towards the nearest exit.
4436	A: i'm glad you're here now, despite the circumstances.
4437	B: honey, let's discuss this further and find a solution that works for everyone.
4438	A: ok, i'll try to clear the paper jam.
4439	great idea, b! half-and-half it is.
4440	B: true, memories can be hard to let go.
4441	A: while understanding your perspective, having an adequate number of supervisors is crucial to maintain productivity and order. a balance between leadership and workforce is essential.
4442	i encourage student-led discussions and provide guidance when necessary, allowing students to explore their ideas and take the lead in the learning process.
4443	A: i'll mark that in the system, thank you. goodbye for now.
4444	A: i've heard honey and lemon can be soothing for a sore throat as well.
4445	A: yes, but their relationship is different. he expects more from me.
4446	B: my plan is to eventually secure a permanent position here and make a long-term career. i anticipate continuous learning and growth opportunities within the company.
4447	A: i'm sorry to hear that. maybe communication can help clear things up between you two.
4448	A: understood, yuri. i'll make a decision on the next steps once we have more information. stay safe.
4449	A: yes, i enjoy hiking and reading.
4450	A: yes, we have a projector available. i'll bring my laptop with the charts loaded. looking forward to the meeting on tuesday at 2:15 pm.
4451	i'll consider it, thank you. let me get back to you with your final offer. (Â£800 per set cif london with a 4% commission)
4452	A: i see. best of luck in your new academic endeavor here.
4453	A: i see, understanding cultural differences is crucial for effective exporting. please provide specific examples of how cultural factors influence purchasing decisions in target markets.
4454	no problem, everyone learns new things. i'll be happy to help you understand and process this bill of exchange. let me guide you through the steps and answer any questions you have along the way.
4455	the receptionist handles front desk duties and greets visitors, the junior secretary provides administrative support to one or more executives, and the senior secretary manages more complex tasks and oversees junior secretaries. (based on b's previous response)
4456	i'm glad you find the price reasonable, looking forward to your call for reservation.
4457	it should only take around 5 minutes to walk there based on the distance given.
4458	it's unfortunate that grandpa is finding it difficult to quit smoking despite the doctor's advice. i can understand if you'd like to have a conversation with him about it.
4459	B: the job typically starts at 1:00 pm in the afternoon.
4460	B: i'll go get them now. (pauses for a moment) here they are. (pauses as a hangs up the clothes) is there anything else i can help with?
4461	i'm glad you enjoyed the service as well, b. the whole experience was truly impressive.
4462	A: that sounds like a good solution, b. let's arrange a time to visit the apartment together.
4463	A: i'll give you my address later. thank you for offering to help.
4464	that's an option, but i still don't feel like doing much today.
4465	i can accept either cash or check. please bring the payment when you can.
4466	you're too kind, it's my pleasure. enjoy your new souvenir from rome.
4467	A: i'll make sure to seat you at table 7 near the window. enjoy your meal!
4468	A: thank you. i'll turn right at the traffic lights to find the bus stop.
4469	A: you're welcome, b.
4470	A: perhaps we could offer more incentives for using public transport or alternative modes of transportation, like bikes or electric vehicles, to make the transition less restrictions and more appealing.
4471	A: the lady at immigration will ask for those receipts to proceed. enjoy your trip.
4472	A: that rolex is quite an investment, but this casio watch is a more affordable option at $50.
4473	A: perhaps not, if the food and service don't improve.
4474	A: no, that will be all, thank you.
4475	A: looking forward to finalizing the deal, b. the quotations will include our best pricing for top-tier quality.
4476	A: i see. please wear athletic attire instead.
4477	A: i'll make sure to note down your request and have the file retyped and sent to you upon nova's return. thank you for informing us about the postponement.
4478	B: have you considered obtaining a library card, a?
4479	B: i can lend you the money, but make sure you pay me back as soon as possible.
4480	i'll be happy to bring you dessert, a. please give me a moment to place your order with the kitchen.
4481	B: i see. that makes sense. enjoy your daughter's commencement and safe travels.
4482	B: it certainly does look appetizing, a. would you like a slice?
4483	A: the first part of the year in your field is considered for comprehensive credit granting, with a minimum credit rating of class a.
4484	A: understood, i'll try again later. bye for now.
4485	A: sure, that works for me. i'll send you the details.
4486	A: i'd like to learn more about chinese calligraphy. it sounds fascinating.
4487	A: i'm joking, of course. let's not talk about divorce. instead, let's focus on the positives of our marriages. how did you and your husband meet?
4488	A: how long ago did you see her last?
4489	yes, i certainly enjoy tennis.
4490	A: i see. thank you, doctor. i'll try to relax.
4491	it's unfortunate that appliances have shorter lifespans these days. your friend's sewing machine sounds in need of an upgrade. wishing you both a happy wedding and a successful gift collection!
4492	yes, it's a beautiful and surreal experience. (a)
4493	B: no, i did not.
4494	A: i'm sorry for the static. the interview is confirmed, jin. please check your email for the details.
4495	A: i see. you didn't find the speech credible then?
4496	to calculate our profit margin, we need to subtract the cost (excluding tax) from the retail price (before tax) and then divide by the retail price. let's assume the average cost per unit is $28.71 due to the 0.2% fluctuation. the profit margin would be ($29.95 - $28.71) / $29.95 = 0.057 or 5.7%.
4497	understood, ms. solomon. i'll discuss it with the team and get back to you.
4498	nice to meet you, tim. i do work upstairs.
4499	A: that sounds great, b. let's go to the chinese restaurant for lunch. thank you for treating me.
4500	B: yes, i have a lighter in my pocket.
4501	people who are not reliable or lack motivation.
4502	A: i understand. i'll be happy to discuss the specifics of the insurance coverage during our talk.
4503	A: i understand. everyone has different interests. enjoy yours.
4504	A: i'll try not to worry, but it's hard. i'll be more careful from now on. thank you for your advice.
4505	sure, i'll get you a bowl of dumplings with egg soup and a bottle of juice.
4506	i'll look up the details and assist you with the flight booking, sir. (b)

4508	A: i will make sure to complete all make-up work as soon as possible, professor.
4509	B: that's good news! no need to study tonight then.
4510	B: yes, i had help from some friends.
4511	A: i'll guide you through the setup process, bob.
4512	it depends on the specific location and timing of rush hour. let's check the traffic reports to be sure.
4513	B: i will do that. call you next week.
4514	i'll transfer you to mr. robert smith's extension now. please hold, please. (presses transfer button)
4515	B: in that case, you can try dialing the full phone number, including the area code if necessary. if it's a local call, you might not need the area code.
4516	A: i'm sorry to hear that. were there any warnings beforehand or was it sudden?
4517	A: yes please, i'd love another serving of pad thai!
4518	A: i understand your perspective, but the overall ensemble's performances were still recognized by the academy.
4519	A: i agree, avoid repeating previous answers when possible.
4520	that's true, parking in town can be a challenge. have you considered looking for an apartment closer to campus with a meal plan or cooking facilities?
4521	A: i'll check that for you, mr. hill. please have a seat in the lobby while i look up your reservation.
4522	A: alright, let's focus on the area causing discomfort. we'll assess the pain there.
4523	A: i'm sorry, but you're under arrest for driving under the influence. please step out of the vehicle.
4524	B: we became friends first.
4525	A: i see where you're coming from, but let's keep the conversation respectful towards all women.
4526	A: last name is gao.
4527	that's a great choice, b. the dragon boat race is always a crowd favorite. enjoy the festival!

4529	A: it's delicious, thank you! have a great yoga session, mr. schmidt.

4531	A: i changed my mind. let's toast to new experiences.
4532	B: really? he seems quite enthusiastic about it.
4533	A: i see, thank you for explaining that. i'll consider opening a savings account instead for earning interest.
4534	this one has a simpler design, madam. does your son like this one?
4535	B: be careful not to scare them too much, bill. happy haunting!
4536	A: yes, please give betty sue my name, "ted", and the document.
4537	B: have a great time with your uncle, lin tao. stay well.
4538	B: no, i was just thinking. i didn't mean to come across as rude at lunch or forget to call you last night. i apologize for both instances. regarding your latest question, i wasn't yarning, i was simply pondering on some thoughts.
4539	A: here's the form for you to fill out.
4540	you're welcome, jodi. glad i could help you with jim's pager number.
4541	i'll go get the key for you to have a look inside.
4542	A: me too. let's hope for a safe and smooth flight.
4543	A: that's great to hear, vicky. your people skills will be valuable in your role at ibm.
4544	i find the design and implementation of electronic systems challenging and rewarding. it's an ever-evolving field with endless opportunities for innovation. (but feel free to ask if you have any specific questions about my role or experiences in electronics engineering.)
4545	A: i agree, the fast-paced work environment can be challenging but rewarding in the long run.
4546	i understand how disappointing this is, but perhaps it's for the best. you'll have other opportunities.
4547	A: i understand that it's been difficult, but have you considered trying to initiate new activities or experiences that don't involve work? perhaps finding a common hobby or interest outside of her job could help bring you closer again.
4548	B: thank you, mr. lin. i appreciate your help with the arrangements. goodbye for now.
4549	B: i had different expectations.
4550	A: that's very kind of you, sir. have a safe journey.
4551	i'm sorry for the inconvenience. you may try contacting the airline to arrange for a flight to your destination as soon as possible. alternatively, you could consider traveling by other means if time permits.
4552	sure, i'd be happy to meet again. let's plan something soon.
4553	B: i apologize, you're right. it's my turn to do the dishes now.
4554	A: that's true, but we can't control the circumstances. let's focus on finding a solution instead.
4555	it's okay if we have different opinions, a. maybe one day you'll find the charm in beijing opera too.
4556	A: understood, mr. johnson. i will present your apartment to potential buyers and contact you when there are any interested parties.
4557	A: it's a great starting point for both fitness and relaxation. give it your best shot. good luck at the class!
4558	i'll open the gate as soon as i can. please wait.
4559	A: apologies for the last-minute request, b. i'll send over a formal request with the requirement for written quotes and subject to confirmation. expect it by end of the week.
4560	B: i understand, some people perform better in high-pressure situations.
4561	yes, i'm interested in the open position advertised in your company.
4562	A: i see, you prefer cooler weather then.
4563	A: the blue dress is indeed the better fit for you, madam. let me get you that size.
4564	A: you're welcome, have a nice day! b: goodbye!
4565	i look forward to it, a. have a safe journey.
4566	A: i see. maybe i should be more careful before jumping into such opportunities. thank you for the warning.
4567	A: yes, it is. i'm a little nervous.
4568	A: i appreciate the concern, but i think i'll be able to make it home on the bus. my medicine is there and i believe it will help alleviate my headache. thank you, professor.
4569	nice to see you too, joe brown. (said jimmy white)
4570	A: i see. that's a significant increase in unemployment. does your country have any specific industries or sectors that are particularly affected?
4571	A: yes, she put a lot of effort into it.
4572	A: yes, they do. jack is trying his best.
4573	yes, it was worth the effort. i'll do my best to maintain the record.
4574	A: i need an id card for the job application.
4575	B: i believe they are required for customs and immigration processing upon arrival in new york.
4576	A: i'm glad you're enjoying it. your hard work paid off.
4577	B: that's great news, a. we should confirm with her and let her know if we can make it.
4578	A: i see. i'll let you know as soon as i have it all.
4579	A: that's a valid concern, but let's focus on what we can control for now.
4580	B: you're welcome, rudy. have a nice day.
4581	A: i'll process the deposit for $300 into your checking account. is that correct? please provide the cash when you're ready.
4582	B: i'll get a doctor's note as soon as possible.
4583	A: i'm waiting for cheaper gas prices to drive.
4584	here's the response from a: "i have the money ready."
4585	A: i'll arrange for inter-library loan. you'll be notified when it's available.
4586	A: we'll provide thorough training on all banking products and services during your onboarding process. don't worry, you'll be an expert in no time. let's proceed with the interview.
4587	understood, i'll wait for your confirmation tomorrow morning.
4588	B: close call, but still a good serve. china's defense is strong today.
4589	A: that's a great idea, let's make it a family dinner night out!
4590	B: it doesn't meet the required specifications.
4591	A: i believe we made plans for everyone to meet at the venue.
4592	the conductor is maestro johnson.
4593	B: no, i don't have a girlfriend currently. how about you, a? do you have a partner?
4594	A: thank you, that would be appreciated.
4595	A: we should consider something tech-related for tom, given his age. mary might appreciate a book or craft kit.
4596	A: i'll take the bus, then. thank you.
4597	B: i appreciate your concern, but i prefer to choose my own clothes, thank you.
4598	B: i agree, "the english patient" was a great choice for that year. now it's my turn. i rolled a three. the category is best actor.
4599	A: no, that will be all for now, ms. wang. we look forward to seeing you at the work-in clinic soon. please try to come as soon as possible to receive the necessary medical attention.
4600	A: i didn't know that about you. it's impressive.
4601	i understand, i will keep you updated if there are any changes.
4602	i'd like to try out my new driving skills and perhaps take a road trip.
4603	i preferred working with other people as it allowed for effective collaboration and learning from one another.
4604	A: i'll return to clean your room fifteen minutes later, sir.
4605	i agree, let's make our purchase right away.
4606	A: yes, it has good balling resistance due to its thick knit fabric.
4607	A: i'll help you fill out the forms for checking those books out. they're due back in two weeks.
4608	B: perhaps he values compromise in his relationship.
4609	A: i'd like to go with express mail, please. let me know the cost.
4610	B: perhaps consider implementing policies to address inflation and provide economic security for the vulnerable, while also focusing on long-term job creation strategies.
4611	A: alright, i'll check back with you in three days then.
4612	B: it will be sent promptly.
4613	B: because diamonds are generally more expensive than rubies.
4614	i will, sir. we'll get there safely and on time.
4615	A: appreciate your help. i'll find my way now. b: feel free to ask if you need anything else. have a good day.
4616	A: maybe we can plan a trip together sometime. b: that would be fun! let's make it happen.
4617	B: if your resume is selected, you will be invited for an interview.
4618	i will notify you once a decision has been made and i have your contact information, so please feel free to provide it before leaving. â a.
4619	i'll give you my number and insurance information. expect a call.
4620	A: i'll give it a try then. thanks for the encouragement.
4621	consider prioritizing tasks and seeking support from others to reduce stress.
4622	A: i think a war movie could be interesting. let's make the reservation then.
4623	true, it can be challenging to find parking at that hour.
4624	yes, you can report such incidents to consumer protection agencies or the better business bureau. they can help you file a complaint and potentially take action against the shop in question.
4625	B: i understand that it can be inconvenient, but our hands are tied by the law and our policies. i apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. i recommend contacting your doctor as soon as possible to get a new prescription.
4626	A: i'd like to give it a try under your guidance, b. safety first.
4627	A: understood, we'll be expecting you around lunch time. thank you.
4628	B: that's an exciting plan! let's start looking for a nice, affordable all-inclusive vacation spot.
4629	B: no, there may be other steps after signing the escrow papers, such as recording the deed and transferring utilities.
4630	A: you're welcome. it's to your right when you get off the elevator.
4631	A: i understand your perspective. best of luck with your personal development in china.
4632	A: i understand your concerns, but i believe making lifestyle changes will improve your health and energy levels. try to prioritize rest, proper nutrition, and regular exercise. let's discuss specific steps to help you manage your workload and reduce stress.
4633	A: i can see why. the design is impressive.
4634	B: that's understandable, everyone has different preferences.
4635	A: i see, he must have been exhausted from running.
4636	great, that sounds like a good alternative route. let's make the exit and head towards pennsylvania freeway.
4637	i will, a. take care.
4638	A: yes, we offer insurance and health benefits as options for our employees. the cost is deducted from your salary. interested?
4639	B: i can meet you at $2200, but i cannot go below $2000.
4640	A: here's your total of $5.48. your order will be ready shortly.
4641	A: i understand, i can work part-time if necessary.
4642	that sounds fun! enjoy your outdoor activities. have a great time playing basketball and volleyball.
4643	A: i'll add that in, betty. thanks for your suggestions.
4644	A: i apologize for the errors, sir. i'll have the soup replaced and the kitchen will work on improving the service.
4645	A: that's interesting. which castle is that? b: it's called old castle, located in the historical part of the city.
4646	B: thank you, i'm glad to hear that.
4647	A: here you go, sir. these are the locus models we have in stock.
4648	it's hard to generalize, but some families with many children might feel contentment and happiness from having a large family, while others might feel envy or curiosity about what life would be like with fewer children. ultimately, it depends on the individual family dynamics and personal preferences.
4649	A: what's inside and what does it look like?
4650	A: i see. you're leaning towards staying at pcc then. b: yes, that's what i'm thinking. a: i understand. it's a tough decision. b: it is. but i think i'll be content here.
4651	signing, a. i'll support your charitable efforts wholeheartedly.
4652	A: i'm glad you ultimately decided to give it to me. i'll treasure it.
4653	i'd be happy to help you redecorate your old house.
4654	A: i'll see you in a few days for a follow-up, b. take care.
4655	i'm sorry to hear that. i hope she gets well soon.
4656	A: nepotism is a real issue in this company.
4657	A: sure thing, here's an extra sheet for you. let me know if you need any assistance with your fantastical kingdom.
4658	B: the total amount in euros, including the commission, is around 301 euros. i'll give you smaller bills if possible. your 400 us dollars have been received.
4659	A: yes, i do. thank you.
4660	i agree, john's playing skills stand out.
4661	A: understood, we will make it right and strive for improved quality in the future.
4662	preparing thoughtful questions to ask the interviewers about the company and the role is essential.
4663	i'd be happy to consider it, please give me the details and i'll let you know.
4664	i understand your concern, a. let me check with my supervisor if there are any alternatives for securing your baggage without a deposit.
4665	A: yes, i'll place your order for the barbeque wings and fettuccini alfredo. is there a specific sauce you prefer for the wings?
4666	it depends on personal preference and time commitment. chess has a steeper learning curve but offers deeper strategy. playing cards has simpler rules but requires more quick decision-making.
4667	i'll be glad to help you prepare for your presentation, a. tomorrow night in your office it is.
4668	A: i'll take that one without a warranty, then.
4669	B: i see. maybe you could ask tom to keep it down or move to a quieter area.
4670	B: i'm trying my best, a. please be patient.
4671	A: i'll get you a quart of light oil right away, sir.
4672	B: i'm sorry, mr. smith, but i cannot check that for you right now. please call the customer support hotline for vcr-related inquiries.
4673	A: that's impressive, b. i'll have to work on my fitness.
4674	thank you, a. i'll be sure to do that and look forward to our next encounter as well. see you next year.
4675	i'm sorry for the inconvenience, but it seems an earlier shipment is not possible given the customs procedures and distribution time in your country. we will work on providing you with the fertilizers as soon as we can.
4676	let's head over to the apartment right now to take a look. the keys are in my hand. (a)
4677	A: i don't, but i may consider it if the sunday edition has as much content as yours.
4678	based on b's statement, it seems they believe their husband's help may not be as extensive or reliable as a perceives it to be. a's response conveys surprise and possibly even a hint of disbelief.
4679	A: thanks, kristin's help was invaluable, but i did put in a lot of thought into your pricing strategies. appreciate your feedback.
4680	i'll make sure to do that, a. thank you for your concern.
4681	A: i found it on the bookshelf, hiding behind yourjournals.
4682	A: the card supports linking multiple accounts for easy transfers.
4683	A: alright, i'll buy it for forty yuan.
4684	A: thank you. (takes the glasses)
4685	B: i understand, a. i'll keep quiet and give you some space.
4686	thank you, xu hua. it's nice to meet you. i'm excited to be in china as well.
4687	the open house is from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on both days this weekend.

4689	A: i see. well, congratulations to you both then. wishing you a happy planning process.
4690	B: i double-checked my email, a. the email was sent on yesterday's date and the recipient was mr. lin. i will resend the document now to ensure he receives it.
4691	A: yes, a typhoon is on its way.
4692	B: a lot of project work and meetings, but also trying to find time for hobbies and self-care. how about you, a? how have you been?
4693	A: yes, i'm sure you did. have a safe journey back home.
4694	A: i have some slacks available for you to try.
4695	understood. i'll try contacting her after noon.
4696	A: the total cost for the ground beef and chicken breasts is $14.61.
4697	A: i wish you the best in your academic pursuits.
4698	A: i'm feeling refreshed, mr. cooper, thank you for asking.
4699	B: i'm not sure, you can check the sign above aisle a for any current sales.
4700	A: unfortunately, that's true. cultural differences can be a significant challenge in a marriage.
4701	great, i'll make sure to attend the information session on tuesday to apply. thank you for the information, a.
4702	occasionally, we got free pizza. why, did you have any particular perks during your studies?
4703	i'm sorry, i have mittens in a different size or color if you'd like to take a look.
4704	B: there's a bank a few blocks down the main street on the right.
4705	A: that's good to know. i'll make sure to allow extra time for the transfer.
4706	A: i'll help you, dad. (or) sure thing, mom. (depending on who a is addressing)
4707	i'll do my best, anika. safe travels to you and your husband as well.
4708	A: yes, there have been concerns about the environmental impact of the oil industry in my country. we are taking steps to mitigate it.
4709	A: not at all, it's the genuine article. enjoy your shopping, sir.
4710	A: i'm not into dolls from cartoons, b.
4711	B: i recommend taking some over-the-counter pain relievers and getting plenty of fluids to help with the headache and fever. rest up and i'll check on you later.
4712	i've got you, sara. let me take those for you.
4713	B: i plan to stay for two years to fully complete my management program.
4714	A: that's it for now. the technician will guide you through any additional steps if necessary.
4715	i'll check right away, mr. williams.
4716	the length of the assignment can vary, but i'll keep you updated once i have that information.
4717	A: i'd like to try on the wire frame ones as well.
4718	A: yes, the atm dispenses cash based on the funds linked to my debit card.
4719	thank you, b. i'm excited for this new adventure.
4720	A: thank you for the information. i'll keep that in mind. (regarding returns and alterations) b: i'll processed your purchase of $70 using the provided card. have a nice day.
4721	agreed, let's contact it to investigate the network issue.
4722	A: i'm in the mood for tequila tonight. a margarita sounds perfect.
4723	A: i agree, let's enjoy the rain and the soft grass beneath our feet.
4724	A: i understand, but maybe you could try being patient with her instead?
4725	B: perhaps we could hire a tutor or find additional resources for him to improve in mathematics.
4726	based on my experience and the value i bring to the team, i would expect a salary commensurate with industry standards for a role of this level and in this industry. we can discuss specific numbers during negotiations.
4727	A: any changes in your bowel movements?
4728	B: the russians will have to score at least two goals in the second half to achieve that.
4729	i see. i'll open that window now.
4730	B: i'm sorry, we only accept credit cards for lodging payments. you may try using a different card or return with a credit card if possible. otherwise, we'd be happy to help you arrange alternative lodging near here.
4731	thank you for the reassurance, b. i will continue to put my best effort into making sure the view is as perfect as possible.
4732	B: it's just a rug, it can be cleaned. no need to worry.
4733	A: i'll get off at the next stop then.
4734	A: i've considered it, but my schedule is quite busy. maybe a home workout routine could work?
4735	A: i agree, let's inform the waiter about the issues with our meals.
4736	B: i hadn't considered that, but it's an interesting responsibility. i'll think about it.
4737	i'm glad you're enjoying the art, a. next, we should check out the modern art wing. let's explore it together.
4738	A: i understand, keep positive. good luck with your new opportunity.
4739	A: it's a concern, but past experiences show that preventive measures are often not taken until after the damage has occurred.
4740	i understand, a. please make sure to do your due diligence before accepting any job offers. best of luck with the recruiting agency.
4741	B: it was sunny with a mild breeze.
4742	based on the information currently available, i cannot provide an exact arrival date. i'll continue checking and get back to you as soon as i have an update.
4743	i understand your concerns about the excessive violence on the new channel. agreed, the lack of educational content is disappointing.
4744	A: i see, i'll include that detail as well. thank you for your help, b.
4745	A: i'll leave the revenge to you, but let's focus on the investigation. no forwarded messages, please.
4746	B: i see, you focus on smaller local companies in the trade and shipping industry in northeast china.
4747	A: ah, i see. agree on the nostalgia.
4748	A: i understand, mr. james. we will continue this questioning at a later time with your attorney present. in the meantime, you are being detained and cannot leave this area.
4749	B: alright, i'll cut your hair to a few inches in length then.
4750	B: yes, it does. we're working on improving the technology to minimize emissions.
4751	B: you could try getting a part-time job or selling some items you no longer need.
4752	A: fifty yuan it is, then. would you like it gift-wrapped?
4753	A: i see, that's good to know. but i still think bringing cell phones to meetings could be distracting. maybe setting aside specific times for checking messages would be a better solution.

4755	A: he spoke highly of you. b: i'm flattered.

4769	B: try your local library or bookstore for recommendations.
4770	A: i feel you. it can be challenging to balance personal needs with communal living. maybe try using headphones for a more private viewing experience? or find a quieter place in the house to watch your own shows?
4771	A: that's correct, madam. once you've entered the amount, press "confirm" or "enter" to complete the transaction. the machine will dispense the cash and print a receipt. if you have any questions or need assistance throughout the process, don't hesitate to ask.

4813	A: not just the pearl tower and the bund, what else have you explored?
4814	in china, it's common to have a big feast with family and friends. the birthday person typically wears a red hat and receives red envelopes filled with money as gifts.

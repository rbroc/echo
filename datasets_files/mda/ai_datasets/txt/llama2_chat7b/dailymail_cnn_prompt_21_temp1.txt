145	congress has reached a bipartisan $1.012 trillion spending deal that would roll back some spending cuts, raise federal worker pay, and have a wide-ranging impact on americans' everyday lives. the deal would green-light spending through september and marks a break from years of forced budget cuts and constant congressional funding fights. both republicans and democrats have found something to like in the agreement, with republicans getting cuts to the environmental protection agency and the irs, and democrats getting increased funding for head start and mental health programs. the deal would also give disabled veterans and some military spouses a reprieve from a pension cut set to go into effect in 2015. the measure would also impact air travel, mandating that the transportation security administration certify more travelers as eligible for "expedited" screening and capping the number of tsa agents at 46,000. additionally, the deal would allow americans to have more lighting options and less efficiency, stopping the implementation of a new light-bulb standard, and requiring that a "prevention and public health" account be used only for, well, prevention and public health. while the deal is not all sweeping, it does contain countless smaller provisions, including a ban on funding any new portraits of officials. the house is set to pass the measure on wednesday, with a short-term funding bill to give the senate time to debate and vote later this week.
146	a british company, seymourpowell, has designed an adjustable plane seat concept called "morph" that could revolutionize air travel for larger passengers and families. the seat replaces traditional foam padding with a stretchy fabric that can be adjusted to fit different body types and sizes. the design allows for more comfortable flights without reducing leg room, and passengers can book seats that are tailored to their needs. the seats can be adjusted for recline, height, and width, and can also be optimized for privacy, work, or comfort for passengers with disabilities. while it may take over a decade for the morph seats to be introduced on planes, some airlines have already adopted similar seating plans, such as air new zealand's "skycouches" and airbus's additional aisle seats. the morph design could potentially solve the issue of larger passengers being charged double for their seats, and could provide a better option for passengers who want more comfort and flexibility on flights.
147	stephen colbert, a comedian and television host, encouraged his audience to edit the wikipedia pages of potential vice presidential candidates for mitt romney's presidential ticket. this prompted wikipedia to lock the pages of several candidates, including tim pawlenty, rob portman, paul ryan, and marco rubio, to prevent excessive edits from influencing the selection process. the number of edits to a candidate's wikipedia page has been seen as a possible indicator of their likelihood of being chosen as the vice presidential nominee, with the most edits belonging to new hampshire senator kelly ayotte. however, some have criticized this approach as flawed, as it may be influenced by the same sources making multiple edits, or by users with ulterior motives. the romney campaign has released an app to deliver news of the vice presidential selection, and some have suggested following the money or the media attention as other indicators of the choice.

155	in a surprising turn of events, russian foreign minister sergey lavrov signed an agreement in geneva with the united states, the european union, and ukraine, which seems to contradict president vladimir putin's provocative statements on ukraine. the agreement requires all illegal armed groups to disarm, and all buildings and streets occupied by them to be vacated. this is a major stand down by russia, as it undermines putin's claims of supporting ethnic russians in ukraine and his right to intervene in ukrainian affairs. the agreement also grants amnesty to protesters who surrender weapons and does not exclude those found guilty of capital crimes. the document represents a standard against which russia's reduction of terrorist activities in eastern ukraine and its behavior towards them can be measured. however, it remains to be seen whether russia will stick to the agreement, as putin's past actions have shown a lack of trustworthiness. the next few weeks will determine whether russia is serious about the agreement and its intentions in ukraine.

172	in her recent op-ed piece for time magazine, author and educator camille paglia argues that many college-age women are naive about men's true nature and become victims of rape because they do not understand the evil that exists in humanity. paglia, a self-described "dissident feminist," believes that society has done women a disservice by leading them to believe that men's sexual desires can be tamed through education and speeches. she argues that the true danger to female students is "the ancient sex crime of abduction and murder," and that colleges should focus on academics rather than lecturing students about sex assault, which she believes is an exercise in futility. paglia also takes a swipe at the american education system, accusing teachers and schoolbook authors of sanitizing history by removing mentions of "horrors and atrocities" stemming from human nature. she contends that both liberal and conservative worldviews are lacking a profound sense of evil, and that critics and thinkers debating gender ideology are mistakenly trying to change the fundamental nature of men through campus initiatives and well-meaning speeches. paglia's most controversial point is that extreme sex crimes like rape-murder emanate from a primitive level that even practical psychology no longer has a language for, and that young women do not see the "animal eyes glowing at them in the dark."

196	abu hamza, a radical cleric found guilty of terror charges in new york, is likely to spend the rest of his life in a us top security prison. however, merely stopping high-profile extremist preachers is not enough to combat the broader threat of extremism. the likes of abu hamza have left a legacy that has been taken up by western-born recruits, who are using educational institutions, prisons, and the internet to spread extremist messages. the fact that around 400 british citizens have traveled to syria to join jihadist groups suggests that these efforts are still having some success. to effectively tackle extremism, universities and colleges must not host extremist preachers without providing a robust challenge to their views, and prisons must offer mentoring and support to help prisoners turn their lives around and become less susceptible to recruitment. online extremism must also be challenged with counter-arguments, and this can be done through websites and social media accounts that confront the extremist narrative. arresting key individuals or shutting down extremist websites is not a long-term solution, as extremist narratives only lose their appeal when they are undermined and thoroughly discredited through open debate and the presentation of positive and enlightened values. ultimately, extremism will stop appealing to young people when it becomes unfashionable and is regarded as yesterday's news, but this will only happen when there are more counter-narratives and alternative narratives that offer a better understanding of the world and a stronger sense of national and regional identity.

226	scottish farmer mark clark is facing a major crisis as his daffodil crop was ready for picking a week earlier than expected due to warm weather, but he cannot find enough workers to pull the flowers out of the ground. this has resulted in a flooded market and a significant loss of income for clark, as the price of the flowers has plummeted. despite advertising for pickers in local newspapers and job centers, clark has only been able to find around 100 workers, far short of the 500 he needs to bring in the entire crop. the situation is made worse by the fact that many of his main competitors for growing daffodils are in lincolnshire and cornwall, where they had a cold spell in early february that put their crops on hold for two weeks, bringing their picking seasons closer to scotland's. as a result, the market is already saturated with flowers and the price is low, making it impossible for clark to make a profit.
227	according to a report by business analysts, new year's day is expected to be a busy day for gift returns, with more presents being exchanged than on any other day of the year. the trend is fueled by the rise of online shopping, with many people taking advantage of quicker refunds and the lure of sales to return items they did not want or did not fit. the report estimates that 29 million unwanted christmas gifts are being returned this year, with an estimated value of Â£600 million. small independent shops and big-name chains with online ordering arms are expected to face a challenge in managing the large number of returns, while major shopping centers are opening late to take advantage of the increased foot traffic. despite the pressure on retailers, some people are choosing to avoid the crowds and shops, with a yougov poll showing that the average household spent Â£604 on gifts this holiday season.

249	the cuban government has announced a new policy allowing its athletes to compete professionally abroad, potentially opening the door for talented cuban athletes to join teams in the united states. however, there are several obstacles that stand in the way of cuban athletes seeking contracts in the us, including the us embargo on cuba and the requirement for athletes to seek government approval to travel abroad. major league baseball has not yet commented on the policy change, but it is unlikely that cuban athletes will be able to compete in the us without government approval. additionally, the new policy may be seen as a recognition of the lucrative market for athletes, but it also emphasizes the idea of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need," suggesting that any money earned abroad will still be taxed and directed back to the cuban government.
250	two farmers in missouri contracted a new viral disease, dubbed the "heartland virus," after being bitten by ticks. the virus, which belongs to the phlebovirus family, is a newly identified type of disease that has not been detected before. although the men experienced symptoms similar to those of other tick-borne illnesses, such as fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite, their blood tests showed that they did not have a bacterial infection. further testing revealed that the virus is a new species of the phlebovirus family, and its closest relative is a tick-borne virus called severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (sfts) virus, which was identified last year in china. the study suggests that the "heartland virus" may be more common than previously thought and that there may be more cases of the disease that have not been detected. the researchers recommend using repellents that contain 20% or more deet to prevent tick bites and avoiding wooded areas or areas with high grass.
251	a major landslide in the coastal town of scarborough, north yorkshire, uk, has been attributed partially to leaks from a pipe used by a nearby frozen food manufacturer, mccain's. the pipe carries effluent from the factory to the sea, and experts believe that the leaks are causing instability in the cliff face, leading to landslips and the potential collapse of homes. residents have been warned that their properties are at risk and have been negotiating with the council for rebuilding on nearby land, but progress has been slow. the situation has caused stress and concern for the elderly residents, with some homes already abandoned and others at risk of collapse. mccain's has been contacted by residents and has promised to assess the report, but the company has not yet commented publicly on the issue.

282	thousands of people in munich, germany have been evacuated from their homes as experts try to defuse a 550lb allied bomb that was dropped during world war ii. the bomb was found beneath a building in the schwabinger district, near the city center, and is believed to have been dropped by either american or british planes in 1944 or 1945. bomb disposal teams are concerned that the bomb's complex chemical fuse could trigger a repeat of the 2010 tragedy in which three experts were killed in another german city. to avoid this, experts plan to surround the bomb with sand and carry out a controlled explosion. the evacuation of 2,500 people from the area is expected to last until wednesday, and parts of a nearby street have been sealed off. this discovery highlights the ongoing problem of undetonated explosives in germany, with barely a week passing without a new discovery. the allies dropped 2.8 million tons of bombs during wwii, with the usaaf dropping 1.5 million tons and the raf dropping 1.3 million tons. british bombers flew a total of 390,000 sorties.
283	in recent days, much of the northeastern united states has experienced extremely cold weather, with temperatures dropping to levels not seen in 20 years. this cold snap is caused by distortions in the jet stream, a fast-moving air current that flows from west to east above the earth's surface. the jet stream shapes the atmosphere and influences the movement of cold and warm air masses. while the current cold weather is unusual, it is not the result of global warming, which is causing the poles to warm faster than other latitudes. however, the weakening of the jet stream due to global warming may lead to more extreme weather events, including colder snaps. the relationship between long-term climate changes and short-term extreme weather is still not fully understood, and ongoing research is debating the impact of global warming on temperature contrasts and the frequency of extreme weather events.
284	in the past, egyptologists have removed the wrappings of mummies without proper care, causing damage to the bodies and losing valuable information. however, recent advancements in technology have allowed researchers to scan mummies using ct scans, which are non-invasive and provide detailed images of the body's insides. the british museum has used this technology to scan eight mummies, including a priestess and temple singer named tamut, who died around 900 bc. the scans have revealed new information about the mummies, such as their age, cause of death, and even the presence of amulets placed on their bodies. for example, tamut's scans revealed details of her amulets, including one with the eye of horus, which was believed to have healing properties. additionally, the scans revealed that one of the mummies, a man believed to be in a woman's sarcophagus, was actually male and died around 600 bc. the scans also showed evidence of poor dental health, including numerous abscesses caused by infections that spread to the bloodstream. overall, the use of ct scans has greatly improved the understanding of these ancient bodies and their history.
285	a recent study conducted in japan found that consuming high amounts of rice and other high glycemic index (gi) foods can lead to better quality sleep. the study, which analyzed data from over 1,800 factory workers, found that those who consume more rice and high gi foods tend to have better sleep quality and duration compared to those who consume less of these foods. additionally, the study found that consuming high amounts of noodles was associated with poorer sleep quality. the researchers suggest that the effects of starchy foods on sleep may vary depending on their gi values, and that a diet high in gi, including high amounts of rice, may contribute to good sleep. the study's findings back up previous research that has shown that tryptophan, an amino acid found in high gi foods, can induce sleep by increasing the production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin.

395	the us defense advanced research projects agency (darpa) is working on a project called phoenix, which aims to salvage and reuse parts from defunct communication satellites to build new ones. the agency has awarded contracts to several companies to develop technologies that can enable robotic space missions to retrieve components from old satellites and integrate them into new ones. the project aims to reduce the cost of military space missions by repurposing satellites in orbit rather than launching new ones from scratch. the first demonstration mission is scheduled for 2016, which will involve launching a robotic mechanic to retrieve an antenna from a retired satellite and integrate it with mini-satellites to create a new communication system. if successful, the project could potentially reduce costs in the long term by reusing materials in space rather than constantly launching new satellites.
396	a recent study has found that crash dieting can lead to significant muscle loss, which can make it difficult to maintain weight loss in the long term. researchers at the european congress on obesity in bulgaria discovered that individuals on very low calorie diets lost much more muscle than those on slower, more sustainable weight loss plans. the study found that even a month after the diet, the crash dieters had lost almost three times as much muscle as the slow dieters. the study also suggested that highly restrictive diets, such as those that only allow for cabbage soup, lead to rapid muscle loss due to a lack of protein in the diet. this muscle loss can leave individuals feeling weak and can lead to a cycle of overeating and weight gain. the study's lead author, professor marleen van baak, believes that crash dieting is not sustainable in the long term and that it is important to learn how to eat healthily and maintain weight loss over time.

399	mcdonald's new "dollar menu and more" might seem like a bargain, but the truth is that the fast-food industry as a whole actually costs taxpayers billions of dollars every year. despite paying low wages and offering limited benefits, fast-food companies like mcdonald's rely on public assistance programs to support their employees, who often have to rely on food stamps, medicaid, and other forms of assistance to make ends meet. in fact, the 10 largest fast-food companies in the us cost taxpayers an estimated $3.8 billion each year. mcdonald's alone costs taxpayers an estimated $1.2 billion annually. the good news is that fast-food workers are organizing and demanding better wages and working conditions. raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour, as proposed in the fair minimum wage act of 2013, could generate $32 billion in new economic growth and boost wages for 30 million workers. the author argues that a fairer fast-food industry that provides higher wages and spares taxpayers billions in costs every year is worth fighting for.

441	every day, people encounter methane, a key ingredient in farts, in their daily lives. however, methane is not just a natural byproduct of digestion, it is also a major contributor to climate change. recently, three new craters were discovered in siberia, each over 200 feet deep and 100 feet wide, indicative of methane explosions caused by thawing frozen methane. the concentration of methane in the air surrounding these craters is 53,000 times higher than normal. additionally, a team of researchers found vast methane plumes shooting from the sea floor off the siberian coast. these discoveries suggest that methane hydrates, frozen methane held in place by pressure and temperature, are collapsing and releasing massive amounts of gas into the atmosphere. methane is a potent greenhouse gas, producing 86 times the heat-trapping effect of carbon dioxide, and it's predicted that methane emissions will continue to rise as oceans warm. to address this issue, it's important to recognize that the increase in methane emissions is caused by a positive feedback loop, where warming temperatures lead to more methane release, which in turn accelerates warming. additionally, it's important to acknowledge that human activities, such as fracking and burning methane for energy, are contributing to the problem. to mitigate the issue, it's crucial to stop subsidizing pipelines that transport fracked methane and instead invest in cleaner energy sources such as wind and solar.
442	researchers have found that adding tiny amounts of silver to antibiotics can make them up to a thousand times more effective in fighting infections, suggesting that silver could be a valuable weapon in the fight against antibiotic resistance. existing antibiotics could be laced with silver or coated in a fine layer of the precious metal to treat hard-to-treat infections such as those that cause urinary tract infections or infect catheters. the study found that silver makes bacteria more "leaky," allowing antibiotics to enter and kill the bugs more effectively, and also boosts the production of oxygen molecules that aid in the death of bacteria. this approach could potentially help combat the growing problem of antibiotic-resistant superbugs, which could become deadly without urgent action.

629	scientists have found that the voices of politicians and other powerful individuals change when they are in a position of power. they become louder, more monotonous, and have less variation in pitch. these vocal changes are subtle, but listeners are able to pick up on them and use them to determine who is in charge. the study, published in the journal psychological science, found that when college students were assigned to play a role in a negotiation exercise, their voices changed to match their perceived level of power. high-rank individuals were more likely to go up in pitch and become more monotonous in tone, while also varying in volume more than low-rank individuals. a second experiment showed that listeners were able to pick up on these power-related vocal cues and accurately determine who held a position of power. the findings suggest that vocal cues can be used to determine leadership and authority in social interactions.

635	great tits, small birds found in the uk, have been observed passing on cultural traditions through generations and adapting them to fit in with local populations. scientists have found that these birds learn from observing others and pass on these learned behaviors to their offspring, even if it means changing their own personal preferences. this is the first time such cultural conformity has been observed in wild animals beyond primates, and it suggests that some animals may be more "cultural" than previously thought. the study, published in nature, found that great tits in different populations adopted the same puzzle-solving method taught to them by captured males, even though the birds themselves had not learned the method. when a bird moved to a new population, it tended to conform to the local tradition rather than sticking to its own personal preference. this research challenges the idea that cultural learning is limited to primates and suggests that other animals may have similar capacities for cultural adaptation.

662	the ongoing conflict between israel and hamas in gaza has resulted in severe restrictions on media coverage, with international journalists being barred from entering the palestinian territory. the israeli government has accused hamas of exploiting the deaths of civilians to gain international sympathy through the media, and has therefore prevented reporters from being embedded with the military. this strategy is different from israel's position during the 2006 war in lebanon, where reporters were allowed to broadcast from israeli artillery positions. the lack of media access has led to criticism from the foreign press association, which has accused israel of violating press freedom. despite this, some israeli journalists are embedded with the military in gaza, but are not allowed to report from other areas. the un relief and works agency for palestine refugees in gaza has also expressed concern that the absence of journalists is preventing the truth from getting out. the restrictions on media coverage have led to a public relations battle between israel and hamas, with both sides launching websites and youtube videos to present their perspectives.

666	the sinai peninsula in egypt has become increasingly lawless following the country's arab spring revolution, with criminal elements, bedouin tribes, and islamist militants taking advantage of the security vacuum to engage in drug and arms smuggling, human trafficking, and terrorism. this has raised concerns about the security of israel and egypt, as well as the stability of the region. the israeli-egyptian peace treaty, which has provided security and balanced tensions in the region since 1978, is under threat due to the growing instability in the sinai. the situation has led to a human rights nightmare, with thousands of refugees being held captive and subjected to torture, forced labor, and rape, and there have been recent attacks on and abductions of members of the multinational force and observers. it is important for the international community, including the us, to engage in joint discussions with israelis and egyptians on security in the sinai and preserving the multinational force and observers' mission, as well as to pressure the egyptian military to reinforce checkpoints on the borders and combat human trafficking. addressing the underlying economic and social issues in the sinai is also crucial to long-term stability in the region.

668	the uk government's attempt to cut down on the "privilege days" enjoyed by civil servants, which include an extra half-day off on the queen's birthday, has hit a roadblock due to constitutional issues. the proposal to eliminate the two-and-a-half days was scuttled after it was discovered that one of the days had been personally granted to the civil service by the queen on her coronation 60 years ago. the queen's birthday privilege day was reportedly seen as untouchable, and the proposal was deemed "very difficult" to implement. the cabinet office has since announced that civil servants will continue to enjoy their full two-and-a-half days of privilege leave, which some view as excessive in the current economic climate.
669	house speaker john boehner has expressed frustration with the tea party movement within the republican party, calling them "ridiculous" and accusing them of pushing members in places they don't want to be. this comes as the republican national committee (rnc) is planning to limit the number of debates in the 2016 primary process and potentially strip candidates of delegates who participate in unofficial debates. many tea party-leaning politicians and activists are resisting the establishment's attempts to rein them in, with some arguing that the tea party started as a way to express voter frustration with big government but has become a thorn in the side of the establishment. the tea party may face a critical decision on whether to be reined in or break out on its own. the scenario is reminiscent of ronald reagan's shift from being a democrat to a republican in the 1960s.
670	one year after the fukushima nuclear disaster in japan, the us nuclear regulatory commission is facing a crossroads. while the agency has proposed measures to prevent a similar disaster in the us, their effectiveness depends on how well they are executed and implemented. the nuclear industry is taking matters into its own hands by launching a voluntary program to improve reactor safety, but this program may not adequately protect the public. the fukushima accident highlighted several vulnerabilities in us reactors, including the lack of backup power sources and inadequate emergency core cooling systems. the nrc has proposed improvements in these areas, but progress has been slow. the agency has also been criticized for downplaying the importance of its own task force recommendations and for not addressing deficiencies in emergency evacuation planning and spent fuel storage standards. the nuclear industry's voluntary program has also raised concerns, as it may not ensure adequate protection for the public. the authors of this commentary argue that the nrc needs to address these issues urgently and not rely solely on the industry to improve reactor safety.
671	harriet harman, the deputy leader of the labour party, was ridiculed for requesting that david cameron inform her every time raf jets took off to bomb islamist militants in iraq. this came during an emergency shadow cabinet meeting where the party was finalizing its position on the military action. some of harman's own party colleagues found the request "farcical" and "bonkers," with one mp saying that it was not the place of politicians to be informed of every military operation. despite this, harman's office claimed that she was simply concerned about avoiding civilian casualties in the bombing campaign.

678	scientists have discovered how our brains determine our sense of direction. researchers at university college london used mri scans to study the brains of 16 people as they played a navigation game, and found that there are specific cells in the entorhinal region of the brain that are responsible for determining our sense of direction. these cells are activated when we face a certain direction and are also involved when we plan to turn in a different direction. the study found that people with a poor sense of direction had less activity in these cells, suggesting that the brain's internal compass is weaker in these individuals. the research could lead to training programs to improve sense of direction and may also help understand the early stages of degenerative brain disorders such as dementia.

702	in cnn's opinion, the 2012 republican presidential race has become a "silly" and "pointless" affair, with the candidates focused on personal attacks and a lack of serious debate on the issues. the party's establishment power brokers are seen as irrelevant, as the grassroots movement and wealthy donors hold the most influence over the campaign. the author, gloria borger, suggests that the candidates should end their campaigns and unite behind the front-runner, mitt romney, in order to defeat president obama. however, the candidates seem unwilling to do so, with newt gingrich and rick santorum continuing to challenge romney despite their lack of enthusiasm for his campaign. the author notes that the public is split between conservative and evangelical groups that will never fully support romney, but may be willing to accept him as the party's nominee. ultimately, the author argues that the candidates must decide when to end their campaigns and unite behind romney in order to avoid a long and costly primary season that may ultimately hurt their chances of defeating president obama in the general election.

802	in a speech on friday, president obama is expected to address changes to the national security agency's (nsa) controversial surveillance programs, which collect data on the phone calls of all americans. the president is expected to announce substantial changes to these programs, which have been criticized for their lack of transparency and potential infringement on privacy rights. according to a review of 225 individuals charged with terrorism-related crimes since 9/11, the nsa's bulk collection of american telephone metadata has played a role in only 1.8% of these cases. the review also found that the nsa's surveillance of non-us persons outside of the us played a role in 4.4% of cases, and an unidentified authority played a role in 1.3% of cases. the president has several options for addressing the phone data collection program, including continuing the program as is, giving the data collection program to a private entity, or mandating that phone companies keep the data. however, the status quo is open to legal challenges, and alternative approaches may be more effective in balancing national security needs with privacy rights.

885	according to a neuroscientist, dr. daniel amen, women and men have different brain structures and functions that contribute to their distinct behaviors and characteristics. some key findings include: * women have more brain cells in the pre-frontal cortex, which is responsible for planning, organizing, and decision-making. this is why women tend to be more conscientious and detail-oriented. * men have larger amygdalae, which process fear and anger, explaining why they tend to be more impulsive and reactive. * women have more gray matter in the part of the brain that governs intelligence, allowing them to multitask and consider multiple perspectives. * women have more cells in the part of the brain that controls empathy, enabling them to better understand and respond to the emotions of others. * men and women have different distribution of gray and white matter in the brain, which affects the way they process information and solve problems. * women tend to be more sensitive to the emotional climate and are more likely to take on a nurturing role. * men are more likely to engage in single-minded problem-solving, while women are more likely to consider multiple perspectives. * women are better at picking up on subtle cues, such as body language and tone of voice, while men tend to focus on the main issue at hand. * women are more prone to feeling emotional and physiological responses, such as crying, when faced with an emotional stimulus. it's important to note that these differences are not absolute and that there is a wide range of variation within each gender. additionally, these differences are shaped by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and cultural factors.

888	the 1919 chicago white sox scandal, also known as the black sox scandal, is a legendary tale in baseball history where some members of the team purportedly threw the world series against the cincinnati reds. while it was thought that such a brazen act would be impossible to achieve today with the abundance of technology and media scrutiny, an article by ron rapoport suggests otherwise. in 1921, there was no television or radio broadcasts of baseball games, making it easier for the players to get away with throwing the series. even in the present day, with the abundance of cameras and social media, it is evident that a group of players could still conspire to throw a game. an article by bob greene in the chicago tribune, written in 1919, illustrates how a reporter could spot and document games being thrown in real-time, highlighting the fact that even with fewer eyes on the games, some observers could still notice something amiss. while the odds of throwing a game may seem impossible today, the black sox scandal serves as a reminder that anything is possible with the right combination of motivation and opportunity.
889	boris becker, a former world no. 1 tennis player, was spotted at the us open with a large lump on his left elbow. the lump, which is similar in size to a tennis ball, appears to be a severe case of tennis elbow, a condition that causes pain and inflammation around the outside of the elbow due to overuse of the muscles of the forearm. despite the size of the lump, becker seemed to be carrying on with his coaching duties, including hitting balls with current world no. 1 novak djokovic. the cause of the lump on becker's elbow is unclear, but it may be related to a sudden injury or infection rather than tennis elbow, as becker is a right-hander. the condition can last between six months and two years, but in about nine out of 10 cases, a full recovery is made within a year. becker will have to be careful with his double-handed backhands for the time being, especially when facing djokovic.

891	britain could face power shortages this winter due to the closure of coal-fired power stations to meet eu carbon targets. the national grid has admitted that there is a 4.1% gap between winter supply and demand for electricity, which could be exacerbated by a one-in-20 cold snap. the grid has made emergency plans to keep the lights on, including paying factories to turn off machines during peak times and restarting mothballed oil and gas power stations. however, energy experts warn that there is a risk of "brownouts" (dimming of the lights) and interference with electronic equipment if the grid reduces voltage. the situation has been exacerbated by a series of fires at power stations this year. while energy secretary ed davey has guaranteed that there will be no blackouts, some energy analysts have warned that the calculations made by the national grid may not account for the worst-case scenario.
892	xi jinping, the likely next leader of china, will assume power when the communist party holds its 18th congress on november 8. xi, 59, is currently vice president and is expected to be named general secretary and succeed incumbent hu jintao as president in march. xi's rise to power is significant as he will be the first leader in china's post-1949 generation and the first to spend their formative years during the cultural revolution. details of xi's life are tightly controlled by the government, making it difficult to gather information about him. however, biographies written under pseudonyms and accounts from china watchers provide insights into xi's background, personality, and leadership style. xi was born in 1953 to a prominent political family and grew up in the privileged "princeling" circle. he rose to prominence in the 1990s as the mayor of shanghai and later became the governor of fujian and zhejiang provinces. xi's leadership experience in these provinces has prepared him for promoting the country's private sector, foreign investment, and trade. however, xi's ascension has been marked by bumpy moments, including a two-week disappearance and canceled meetings with foreign officials, fueling speculation about his health and factional infighting. the next leader will have to address corruption and demonstrate seriousness in fighting corruption to maintain public trust.
893	a set of 200-year-old tunnels used to hold french prisoners during the napoleonic wars is up for sale in plymouth, devon, for the bargain price of Â£19,000. the three interlocking subterranean chambers were carved deep beneath naval fortifications and started off as a moat. later, they were drained and used to hold french soldiers and sailors during the wars. afterward, they were bricked over and used as air raid shelters during world war ii. the tunnels were later purchased by the tapper family, who used them to store fishing equipment. now, the tunnels are being sold by bradley estate agents as a "0 bedroom, investment property" with a starting price of Â£19,000. the current owner, kevin tapper, notes that the tunnels have a rich history and were likely used to keep the french prisoners away from the local population to avoid the horrors of naval battle. while the tunnels may have potential for commercial use, it is unlikely that they would be approved for residential use due to their location and restricted access.
894	a recent study has found that nearly half of children in the uk aged 11 have never used public transport, such as buses or trains, without an adult. the study also revealed that many children spend a significant amount of time in front of screens, with over one-third spending at least three hours a day watching tv or using a computer. the study also showed that while many children have their own mobile phones and are frequent users of social media, not all children are constantly using these technologies, and some still spend time playing unsupervised with their friends. the study also highlighted tensions within families, with parents reporting frequent battles with their 11-year-olds and some using punishment, such as sending them to their bedrooms or denying them treats, to discipline them. overall, the study suggests that while some aspects of childhood have changed significantly in the past generation, such as the increasing reliance on technology, others, such as the importance of face-to-face communication, remain the same.

1094	malcolm brenner, a 63-year-old man from australia, recently revealed on a radio show that he had a sexual relationship with a bottlenose dolphin named dolly at an amusement park in florida in the 1970s. brenner claimed that he was attracted to the dolphin and that they had a year-long affair, which he described as "consummate" and "transcendental." the relationship was reportedly consensual, and brenner has written a novel and made a documentary about his experience. however, his actions would be illegal today, as florida did not have a law banning bestiality until 2011. some filmmakers have defended their film's content, arguing that brenner's experience is unique and an "appealing" subject for a documentary. this is not the first time that dolphins have been reported to have sexual encounters with humans - there have been similar incidents documented in the past, including a female scientist who had sex with a dolphin in the 1960s as part of a nasa experiment, and dolphins who have targeted their advances on humans at swimming events. however, the dangers of such encounters can be real, as dolphins are powerful and can weigh over 400lbs.

1147	north korea has been increasingly provocative in recent years, with a series of military incidents and nuclear tests under the leadership of kim jong-un. this has included the exchange of hundreds of shells across the western sea border with south korea, as well as the testing of medium-range ballistic missiles and a nuclear device. while some analysts argue that this is simply more of the same behavior that has been seen under previous leaders, others suggest that kim jong-un has shown a greater willingness to take risks and act unpredictably. the international community has expressed concern over these incidents, with the us intelligence community stating that north korea has expanded its nuclear program and restarted a reactor at its yongbyon enrichment facility. some analysts believe that the recent incidents may reflect north korean frustration with improved relations between south korea and the us, while others suggest that kim jong-un may be testing the limits of his power and the response of the international community. despite the uncertainty, many analysts agree that north korea is a closed and secretive regime, making it difficult to gather accurate information about the inner workings of the government.

1150	a bill to legalize same-sex marriage in tasmania, australia is expected to pass in the state's lower house of parliament this week. if passed, it would be the first state in australia to legalize same-sex marriage. the bill is co-sponsored by the ruling labor party and the greens and is expected to easily pass in the lower house. however, convincing the state's upper house of 15 members, 13 of whom are independents, to pass the bill will be more difficult. if the upper house passes the bill, tasmania will become the first state in australia to legalize same-sex marriage. other states, such as south australia, the northern territory, and the australian capital territory, are also likely to follow suit. the federal government, led by prime minister julia gillard, has not ruled out a high court challenge to the law if it passes. however, the face of the gay rights lobby, rodney croome, is confident that the law will pass and has estimated that thousands of same-sex couples will marry if it does. many see the passage of this law as a significant step towards broader change and equality for lgbtq individuals in australia.

1158	former us vice president al gore's apocalyptic speech in 2007 warning that the north polar ice cap could disappear in as little as seven years has been proven incorrect. in fact, satellite images have shown that the arctic ice cap has expanded by 43-63% since 2012, with an area twice the size of alaska being covered in ice again after being open water two years ago. this is despite the long-term trend of decline in arctic ice due to global warming. professor andrew shepherd of leeds university and university college london stated that the ice has become thicker and more concentrated, with purple areas indicating regions where the ice pack is most dense. he also noted that the ice is more resilient to future melting. however, some scientists, such as professor peter wadhams of cambridge university, continue to predict that the ice will be entirely ice-free by 2015. dr. ed hawkins of reading university warned against reading too much into the recent ice increase, suggesting that 2012 was an extreme low year caused by freak weather, but acknowledged that the decline seen in recent years is not only caused by global warming. dr. hawkins also noted that natural variability may be contributing to the decline, and that it is critical to establish the magnitude of this contribution to make accurate predictions about the future of the arctic ice cap.

1165	one year after a tunisian street vendor set himself on fire, sparking a wave of protests that led to the overthrow of his country's government, a new threat to digital activism is emerging in the united states. the house of representatives is set to vote on the stop online piracy act (sopa) and its senate counterpart, the protect ip act, which would give the government and corporations the power to censor and monitor online activity. the bills aim to protect intellectual property, but critics argue that they would also empower governments and corporations to stifle free speech and dissent, particularly in countries with authoritarian regimes. the bill's proponents claim that it is necessary to protect intellectual property, but the drafters of the bill acknowledge that it could be used to censor and spy on citizens. the bill could also lead to a crackdown on online activism, as website operators would be required to monitor and censor user-generated content to avoid legal penalties. the global voices online organization, an international network of citizen media, has expressed concern that the bill could inflict broad unintended damage on digital activists living under repressive regimes and restrict speech freedoms at home. the organization believes that existing copyright law is already being abused to stifle criticism and public debate, and that the sopa and protect ip act would only exacerbate these problems.
1166	reports have surfaced that isis militants have been trained to fly three captured fighter jets at an air base in syria, raising the possibility of attacks on british, us, and french targets in neighboring iraq. observers claimed that the militants were flying the planes on "short flight" training at the al-jarrah military airport east of aleppo, where isis has a major base. the jets, believed to be decades-old mig21 or mig23 models captured from the syrian military, appear to be equipped with weaponry and could be used for spectacular low-level suicide attacks on western targets. the news comes as isis has almost entirely been driven out of the syrian city of kobane after a fierce fightback by kurdish forces, who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying. meanwhile, isis militants have abandoned all their positions in kobane except for two small pockets of resistance in the east, and kurdish commander baharin kandal claimed that the extremists have not been killed. the us-led coalition of syrian forces has been conducting intense air strikes against isis positions in syria and iraq, and a curfew has been imposed in the iraqi province of ramadi over fears that isis might try to advance on the city. meanwhile, isis has been making gains around ramadi despite ongoing coalition airstrikes, and activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on the mainly kurdish town a month ago. capturing the town would give isis unbroken control of a massive stretch of the syrian-turkish border.
1167	a dedicated nhs dentist, dr. anand kamath, was driven to suicide by health chiefs who threatened to strike him off over minor record-keeping errors. dr. kamath, 42, was the only nhs dentist in his area and saw over 10,000 patients, never refusing anyone. however, an investigation was launched after complaints about his record-keeping, which had suffering due to his large patient list. he felt bullied and harassed after being summoned for a meeting and received a letter warning of disciplinary action. his widow, dr. rajni prasad, says the pressure was too much and he couldn't take the anxiety. the inquest recorded a verdict of suicide, and an nhs england spokesperson said the investigation was following national clinical assessment service advice.
1168	more than five million people in the uk are walking around with high blood pressure without knowing it, which is described as the nation's biggest "silent killer" because it has no obvious signs or symptoms. high blood pressure, also known as hypertension, can lead to strokes, heart attacks, heart failure, and kidney failure, and is one of the most common causes of premature death and disability. despite the risks, many people are unaware they have high blood pressure because it has no symptoms until it causes a serious health problem. public health england has warned that this is a ticking time bomb, and has set up a leadership board to encourage people to take simple steps to reduce their blood pressure, such as changing their diet, keeping a healthy weight, and monitoring their blood pressure regularly. the board will focus on the most deprived areas where people are more likely to have hypertension. regular checks and lifestyle changes can help prevent more than half of strokes and many heart attacks. a high blood pressure reading exceeds 140/90 millimeters of mercury, and it is essential for everyone to have regular checks and take steps to reduce their risk of this potentially fatal condition.

1171	alabama's chief justice roy moore has intervened to try to block same-sex couples from getting marriage licenses in the state, despite a federal judge's ruling that the ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional. moore sent a letter to probate judges ordering them not to issue licenses to same-sex couples, citing the state constitution. however, some judges have said they will continue to issue licenses, and at least one couple has already set up camp outside a courthouse in montgomery in hopes of getting a marriage license. the state's ban on gay marriage was ruled unconstitutional last month by a federal judge, and some probate judges have said they will follow through with the ruling. the situation is unclear, with some judges saying they will defy moore's directive and others expressing confusion about the legal implications of the ruling.

1185	researchers have developed a new technique called "compressed ultrafast photography" (cup) that allows for the capture of high-speed events in the world of ultrafast photography. the technique involves using a special camera lens to take photons on a journey through a small device called a digital micromirror device (dmd), which encodes the image and then reflects the photons to a beam splitter. the photons are then converted to electrons and sheared with the use of two electrodes, which converts time to space. the resulting raw data is then stored in a charge-coupled device (ccd). cup is able to generate two-dimensional color images at up to 100 billion frames per second, which is orders of magnitude faster than current phone cameras. this faster imaging frame rate opens up new visions for scientists to study time-evolving phenomena in areas such as biomedicine, astronomy, and forensics. in biomedicine, cup can be used to detect diseases or reflect cellular environmental conditions by tracking the fluorescence lifetime of fluorescent molecules. in astronomy, cup can be a game-changer by combining the technique with the hubble telescope to provide both the sharpest spatial resolution and highest temporal resolution. in forensics, cup could be used to reproduce bullet pathways and revive a more accurate analysis of the "magic bullet" theory.

1195	a federal immigration board in the united states has rejected an emergency appeal to stay the deportation of john demjanjuk, a former nazi camp guard wanted in germany for alleged involvement in the killing of 29,000 jews during world war ii. demjanjuk, 89, had argued that his deportation would constitute torture due to his declining health, but the board found little likelihood of success in his pending motion to re-open the case. the deportation order was originally issued in 2005, and demjanjuk has been fighting the charges for over two decades. his lawyers have indicated that he may make an additional emergency appeal to the sixth circuit court of appeals, but the chances of success are believed to be slim. the case has been ongoing for over 15 years and is considered one of the longest-running pursuits of an alleged holocaust perpetrator.
1196	during world war ii, the british developed a cunning plan to deceive the german luftwaffe by creating decoy towns and setting them on fire to make them believe they had hit their targets. these "starfish sites" were created in december 1940 and received five blitz attempts that month. they were named after the initials "sf," standing for "special fire" sites, and were commissioned to avoid a disaster like the one that destroyed the city of coventry. the dummy towns were sited miles away from real communities and cities likely to come under attack. when the first wave of german bombers attacked a real target, emergency teams would race to extinguish the flames and then light the decoy fires to fool the second wave into dropping their bombs harmlessly on the decoy site. the ruse was developed by colonel john turner, a respected engineer and retired air ministry officer, but the construction and deployment of the fires may have been more like a stroke of genius from a dad's army-style imagination. the dummy sites were a key tactic used to preserve important transport hubs and cities in britain during the bombings of world war ii, with around 230 dummy airfields, 400 dummy urban and industrial sites, and even dummy railway marshalling yards and docks. by the end of the war, there were 237 starfish sites protecting 81 cities, factories, and other potential targets, divertifying 730 bombing raids.

1211	the article discusses the current crisis on the korean peninsula, with north korean leader kim jong-un threatening to attack washington with nuclear weapons and south korea and the us responding with military mobilization and diplomatic pressure. the author argues that past experiences with north korea have shown that the us cannot negotiate its way out of this crisis, as north korea has a history of cheating and raising demands after making provocations, and that sanctions and pressure have not deterred north korea from pursuing its nuclear weapons program. the author identifies five factors that must be considered in addressing the north korean problem: 1. north korea's intentions: north korea's primary goal is to become a nuclear-armed state, and it will continue to pursue this goal until it is achieved. 2. the danger involved: north korea's nuclear weapons program poses a significant threat to the us and its allies in the region, and the use of these weapons could lead to catastrophic consequences. 3. the efficacy of dialogue: historical experience suggests that north korea will eventually return to the bargaining table, but the us must be realistic about the prospects of successful negotiations. 4. the china calculus: china's involvement is crucial in addressing the north korean problem, but beijing is preoccupied with maintaining stability in the region and may not be willing to take decisive action against north korea. 5. the role of allies: the us must work closely with its allies in south korea and japan to develop a comprehensive strategy to counter north korea's nuclear threat. the author concludes that the us must adopt a multifaceted approach that includes both military and diplomatic pressure, as well as a long-term strategy to address the underlying issues that drive north korea's nuclear ambitions.

1302	malcolm gladwell's new book "outliers" explores the factors that contribute to success, beyond just intelligence and talent. he argues that opportunities, cultural background, and timing play a significant role in determining who becomes successful. gladwell uses examples from various fields, such as business, sports, and aviation, to illustrate his points. one of the main arguments of the book is that the beatles, bill gates, and other highly successful individuals were not necessarily the smartest or most talented, but rather they were born at the right time and place, and had access to opportunities that helped them achieve success. gladwell also notes that many successful people share certain characteristics, such as being born in the right month, attending elite schools, or being part of a particular cultural group. gladwell also explores the concept of "happy accidents," or the idea that successful people often experience lucky breaks that help them along the way. he cites the example of bill gates, who was able to start programming at a young age due to his parents' influence, and the beatles, who were fortunate to be in the right place at the right time to become a popular band. the book also examines the role of culture in shaping success, using the example of canadian hockey players, who are more likely to become professionals because of their birth month. gladwell argues that cultural background and upbringing can play a significant role in determining who becomes successful, and that society should provide more opportunities to help people reach their full potential. finally, gladwell addresses criticisms of his book, arguing that his ideas are not glib or poorly reasoned, but rather offer a more nuanced understanding of success. he suggests that by recognizing the role of opportunity and cultural background in success, we can work towards providing more opportunities for individuals to achieve their full potential.

1493	according to an international team of researchers, melting of the greenland ice sheet is partly caused by heat from the earth's mantle. the team, led by the german research centre for geosciences, found that the composition of the mantle underneath the ice sheet affects melting in specific areas. they used a new thermo-mechanical model to combine ice and climate models with earlier data, showing that the earth's mantle plays a significant role in current climate models. the researchers suggest that ignoring this effect could lead to inaccurate predictions of future ice melt and sea-level rise. the study found that the greenland ice sheet loses about 227 gigatonnes of ice per year and contributes to the current mean sea-level rise of about 3 mm per year. the team claims that a technological solution to refreeze the arctic could be possible, but the only significant question is whether it should be done. two published studies explore the possibility of reducing sunlight reaching the earth by injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere, which could restore the polar ice. the studies suggest that this operation could be accomplished with just a few modified gulfstream jets, costing around $8 billion per year. however, the lead author does not yet advocate for this kind of action.

1683	a new study published in the journal "evolution and human behavior" suggests that the shape of a man's t-shirt can greatly impact how attractive and healthy he appears to women. researchers found that wearing a plain white t-shirt with a large black letter "t" printed on the front can make a man appear more attractive and healthy, as it creates an illusion of broader shoulders and a slimmer waist. the study involved showing female participants images of male models wearing different t-shirt designs and asking them to rate the men's attractiveness and health. the findings revealed that upright t-illusions (where the horizontal bar on the t-shirt is equal or longer than the vertical bar) increased attractiveness and health perceptions, while inverted t-illusions (where the horizontal bar is shorter than the vertical bar) had the opposite effect and made the men appear less attractive and less healthy. the study suggests that fashion can have an implicit positive or negative effect on perceived attractiveness and health, and that designers may be able to use optical illusions to tap into our basic sensory psychology.

1715	a recent study conducted by researchers at illinois university found a direct link between physical fitness and white matter in the brains of children. the study used brain imaging to analyze the brains of 24 children aged 9-10 and found that those who were more aerobically fit had more fibrous and compact white matter in their brains. this type of white matter is associated with better memory, learning, and attention. the study also found significant differences in the integrity of several white matter tracts in the brain, with more fit children having better structured white matter. the researchers believe that this study provides evidence for the old saying "healthy body, healthy mind" and suggests that physical fitness may have beneficial effects on white matter throughout the lifespan. the team is currently conducting a five-year trial to determine whether improving white matter tract integrity through physical fitness can improve cognitive function in children.
1716	in zimbabwe, the limits on cash withdrawals have been lifted, resulting in long lines of residents flocking to banks to withdraw money. with inflation at 231 million percent, the price of goods is rising rapidly, making shopping a challenge for many citizens. the government has deployed soldiers to banks in preparation for the increased demand, and police have arrested union leaders who were planning to protest the limits. the country is also facing a cholera outbreak that has killed over 500 people and sickened thousands, and medical professionals say the lack of safe water is to blame. additionally, human rights activist jestina mukoko has been abducted, and angry, unpaid soldiers have clashed with foreign currency exchangers and civilians.

1768	scientists have discovered why we can detect the distinctive fresh, earthy aroma of an approaching rain storm. using high-speed cameras, they found that when raindrops hit surfaces, they create clouds of tiny particles that carry minute amounts of oil and dust from the surface. these aerosols are blown by gusts of wind ahead of the rain storm, explaining why we can often smell rain even when it has been dry for several days. the research, published in nature communications, showed that different types of rainfall can alter the smell, with light and moderate rain triggering more aerosols than heavy rain. the study also found that the type of soil can influence how many aerosols are released, with sandy and clay soils producing more aerosols than other surfaces. the study's findings could help explain how soil-based bacteria can spread disease, as well as how microbes and chemicals in soil can be delivered to the environment and potentially to humans.

2050	capital one has been accused of violating debt collection laws by showing up at customers' homes to collect on unpaid debts. the fair debt collection practices act prohibits debt collectors from making repeated phone calls, calling before 8am or after 9pm, or visiting a debtor's home without their consent. however, the law only applies to third-party debt collectors and debt buyers, not the original creditor. this means that capital one, as the original creditor, is not bound by these restrictions and can potentially visit a debtor's home to collect on unpaid debts. contemporary contract law is in conflict with technology as consumers are often asked to agree to lengthy and complex terms of use without proper consideration or legal representation. courts have upheld these online agreements based on the principle that consumers should read every page of an agreement before signing it, but this can be unreasonable in today's fast-paced digital world. capital one has acknowledged that its representatives may visit homes to repossess assets in the case of default, but the bank is considering creating two separate agreements for cardholders and other buyers to avoid confusion. however, the bank's actions have yet to be proven to be anything other than a response to negative publicity. the implications of this situation are concerning, as it raises questions about the accountability of corporations and the competency of consumers in entering into contracts.

2058	according to a study conducted by the university of edinburgh, hospitals in large cities act as breeding grounds for the superbug mrsa before it spreads to other parts of the country. the research found that variants of the potentially deadly infection found in smaller regional hospitals most likely originated from larger city hospitals. the study analyzed the genetic makeup of around 80 variants of a major mrsa clone found in hospitals and traced the spread of the infection around the uk. the findings suggest that the transfer of patients between hospitals is a major factor in the transmission of mrsa. the study's lead author, dr. ross fitzgerald, noted that the high volume of patient traffic in large hospitals creates a hub for the transmission of the infection between patients, which can then be spread to smaller regional hospitals. these findings could help in developing strategies to prevent the spread of infections.

2060	career criminal noel "razor" smith believes that the current prison system in the uk is failing and that prisons are in crisis. smith, who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison, argues that the system is not rehabilitating prisoners and is not providing adequate support for those with drug and alcohol problems. he suggests that the mandatory drug testing policy introduced in 1995 has actually led to more prisoners taking heroin instead of cannabis. smith also believes that the use of therapy at hmp grendon is the most successful way of preventing prisoners from re-offending, as it treats prisoners' problems with respect and provides a daily program of therapy. he stresses the importance of giving prisoners proper vocational and educational training as an incentive to move on with their lives after prison. smith's own experience of therapy at grendon helped him turn away from a life of crime, and he believes that more prisons should adopt this approach. however, he is skeptical of the idea of a tough approach to crime, arguing that it can actually make prisoners more determined to never re-offend. smith also expresses doubt about the potential return to football of convicted sex offender ched evans, stating that he does not believe evans has shown enough remorse for his crime to deserve such a return. overall, smith's experiences and views suggest that the uk prison system needs significant reform in order to effectively rehabilitate prisoners and reduce crime.

2074	the fbi kept extensive files on dozens of african american writers during the mid-20th century, including literary luminaries such as lorraine hansberry and ralph ellison. the files, which were kept secret for decades, reveal that the fbi became increasingly obsessed with "revolutionary" black authors and their possible political effects. the agency monitored the writers' travel plans, reviewed copies of their works before they were published, and even investigated their personal lives. the files on some writers, such as langston hughes and james baldwin, were thousands of pages long, and the fbi considered imprisoning some of them in the event of a national emergency. the attention to african american literature during this period parallels a deep hatred of the civil rights movement and martin luther king jr. by fbi director j. edgar hoover. the professor's book, "fb eyes," takes its name from a richard wright poem about being under surveillance and chronicles how law enforcement interacted with black writers from 1919 to hoover's death in 1972. the book shows that the fbi's interest in exploring black writers' ties to socialism and communism increased during the mccarthy red scare era. the knowledge that the fbi was monitoring their work influenced some writers, such as richard wright, and led to rewarding stylistic experiments and self-censorship.

2085	a recent study claimed to have identified the long-sought after jack the ripper, a serial killer who terrorized london's streets in the late 19th century, by analyzing dna from a shawl found near one of his victims. however, other scientists have now raised doubts about the study's findings, suggesting that an error in the analysis may have led to the conclusion that the killer's dna was matched to a living descendant. the study's author, dr. jari louhelainen, had claimed to have found a rare dna sequence on the shawl that matched a descendant of one of the victims, catherine eddowes, and a suspect, aaron kosminski. however, experts say that the actual frequency of the sequence in the population is not as rare as previously thought, meaning that the match is not as significant as claimed. the error may have occurred when dr. louhelainen used a database of dna sequences to calculate the frequency of the sequence, but the database did not accurately represent the population at the time the killer is believed to have lived. the investigation into the error is ongoing, and the author stands by their conclusions.

2286	in 2009, ten years after the end of the war in chechnya, a journalist returned to the region and found significant changes. the once war-torn and violent city of grozny is now a "smoking ruin" that has been transformed into a "bizarrely beautiful" place with a giant mosque and rows of street lamps. there are no signs of bullet holes or shrapnel scars, and instead, the city is filled with workers constructing high-rises and roads. the journalist interviews a local resident who attributes the rapid rebuilding to a deal made between the kremlin and a former rebel fighter, ramzan kadyrov, who has become the president of the chechen republic. kadyrov is a divisive figure who has adopted the habits of a middle eastern despot, including driving a black suv and having a private zoo. however, there are concerns about the price of peace in chechnya, as human rights activists and critics of kadyrov's security forces have been killed. the journalist notes that kadyrov's huge public works projects and security forces have guaranteed stability in chechnya, but there is still unemployment and trouble brewing next door in neighboring regions.
2287	ronald reagan, in a 1961 speech, warned that a federal program like medicare would lead to the "invasion of every area of freedom" and eventually result in the country becoming socialist. despite his own campaign promises to reduce the size of government, once in office reagan expanded medicare to cover "catastrophic" costs and never attempted to reduce social security payments. similarly, conservative politicians today, such as mitch mcconnell and paul ryan, have failed to fulfill their campaign promises to reduce government spending and have instead maintained and even expanded entitlement programs. the author argues that this is due to the fact that while conservatives may be ideologically opposed to big government, they are also operationally reliant on government programs and will punish politicians who try to take them away. the struggle to preserve the constitutional order against the onslaughts of big government will continue, but the author notes that the tea party movement has already achieved a victory of sorts by bringing the nation to the brink of a financial catastrophe.

2291	dentists are calling for a significant reduction in the consumption of added sugars to save the nation's teeth. according to a study published in the public health nutrition journal, daily sugar consumption should be reduced by around 75% to less than 4 teaspoons per day. this is significantly lower than the current average of 58g or 14.5 teaspoons for adults and 76g or around 19 teaspoons for teenagers. the world health organization recommends a reduction to around 5% of daily calories, which is equivalent to 25g or six teaspoons. the study suggests that even lower levels are necessary to protect teeth from decay or caries, bringing the figure down to 2-3% of calories, which is equivalent to 15g a day or four teaspoons. the research paper, co-authored by professor aubrey sheiham of university college london and professor philip james of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine, argues that only a significant cut in the use and consumption of sugar will make a difference in reducing tooth decay. the study has fueled demands for the introduction of a sugar tax on fizzy drinks and other foods to drive down consumption and improve public health.

2303	the united states relied on the theory of deterrence during the cold war to protect itself from nuclear attack by the soviet union. this theory posits that a country with nuclear weapons will not attack another country because the retaliatory strike would be devastating. however, the current us administration is adopting a different approach towards north korea and iran, despite their nuclear ambitions. the us is investing in missile defense systems and threatening military action against iran and north korea. the author argues that this approach is flawed and that the theory of deterrence should still apply to these countries. the author suggests that the us should adopt a more conciliatory approach towards iran and negotiate an agreement that would allow it to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without developing nuclear weapons. the author highlights several reasons why the theory of deterrence should still apply to north korea and iran. firstly, both countries have aggressive and untested leaders who would not want to risk their nations' destruction by using nuclear weapons. secondly, both countries have a history of provocative actions and rhetoric, but these have not resulted in the use of nuclear weapons. the author also notes that past soviet leaders were deterred from using their massive nuclear arsenal, and therefore the same logic should apply to north korea and iran. the author concludes that the us needs to adopt a more nuanced approach towards north korea and iran. threatening military action and investing in missile defense systems is not a viable long-term solution. instead, the us should negotiate with these countries and work towards a peaceful resolution. the author suggests that president obama's approach towards iran could be more effective if he adopts a less threatening posture and focuses on reaching an agreement that would allow iran to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.

2320	the famous "face" on the moon, which has captivated people for centuries, is likely to have been created by magma bubbling up to the moon's surface, according to new research. the us scientists believe that the 1,800-mile-wide section of the moon's procellarum basin was formed by large plumes of molten rock, rather than an asteroid strike. the circles that make up the "face" are actually the result of giant tension cracks in the moon's crust as it cooled around upwelling plumes of hot material from the deep interior. these cracks formed a "plumbing system" in the moon's crust through which magma could meander to the surface, eventually filling the region's smaller basins to create the dark spots we see today. the research was published in the journal nature and was based on high-definition maps of the moon's surface created using nasa data.

2380	a recent study has revealed that dinosaurs breathed through their noses to both smell their surroundings and cool their brains. the research, conducted by scientists at ohio university, used computer simulations and ct scans to study the nasal passages of small plant-eating dinosaurs called pachycephalosaurids, or "pachy" dinosaurs. the study found that these dinosaurs had long, narrow bones called turbinates in the back of their noses, which were similar to those found in modern-day animals such as ostriches and alligators. these turbinates helped to filter and warm the air they breathed, allowing the dinosaurs to cool their brains and smell their surroundings more effectively. the study suggests that this nasal structure was likely present in other dinosaurs as well, and that they may have breathed in a similar manner to modern-day animals.

2447	in august 1989, nasa's voyager 2 spacecraft became the first and only spacecraft to visit neptune, the eighth planet from the sun. during its brief flyby of the planet, voyager 2 captured images of neptune's largest moon, triton, which is larger than the dwarf planet pluto. a new map and video have been released, stitching together the images in unprecedented detail, creating the most comprehensive view of triton's surface ever seen. the video, created by dr. paul schenk of the lunar and planetary institute, uses the best voyager map in color to recreate the encounter with triton as voyager 2 ended its tour of the giant planets and began its trek into deep space in 1989. the map has a resolution of 1,970 feet (600 m) per pixel, and the colors have been enhanced to bring out the contrast. the challenge in restoring the map was the color of triton, as there is uncertainty in the absolute calibration of the color images, and earth-based observations gave different answers. dr. schenk hopes that the new map will help engineers get as much data as possible from the upcoming flyby of pluto by nasa's new horizons probe next summer, and emphasizes the importance of comparing triton's active surface with other active worlds like europa and enceladus. the voyager mission, launched 37 years ago, continues to explore where no spacecraft has flown before, and the anniversary of voyager 1 reaching interstellar space on august 25 is also being marked.

2550	joaquin "el chapo" guzman, the notorious leader of the sinaloa drug cartel, was arrested by mexican marines on saturday in a luxury hotel room in the beach resort of mazatlÃ¡n. guzman, who had been on the run for over a decade, was taken into custody without a single shot being fired. the arrest was the result of a joint operation between mexican marines and u.s. drug enforcement agents, who had been working together for four or five weeks gathering intelligence and tracking guzman's movements. the capture of guzman is a significant blow to the sinaloa cartel, which has been responsible for much of the drug trafficking in north america. guzman was wanted on multiple federal drug trafficking and organized crime charges in both mexico and the united states, and had a $5 million reward offered for information leading to his arrest. guzman's arrest was unexpected, as some had speculated that he had managed to bribe his way out of detection. however, authorities say that guzman's entrances to his homes in culiacÃ¡n, sinaloa were reinforced with steel, which allowed him to escape via tunnel before marines could break down the doors. the capture of guzman is a major victory for mexican security forces, and a significant blow to the drug trade. guzman's arrest has been described as a "landmark achievement" by u.s. attorney general eric holder, and a "victory for the citizens of both mexico and the united states." guzman's cartel has been accused of being involved in the bloody drug war that has plagued mexico in recent years, and his arrest is seen as a significant step towards bringing peace and stability to the region.

2556	according to a recent report by the department of homeland security, there was a decrease in the number of undocumented immigrants apprehended by u.s. customs and border protection (cbp) in fiscal year 2014. for the first time since detailed records began in 1992, less than half of those apprehended were from mexico, with more central americans being caught crossing into the u.s. illegally. while mexicans still made up the largest nationality apprehended, the combined number of hondurans, el salvadorans, and guatemalans apprehended was larger. the decrease in mexican apprehensions and increase in central americans is attributed to improving economic conditions in mexico and worsening security situations in central america. the report also noted a surge in unaccompanied minors and families illegally crossing the border, which has since been controlled by september. additionally, the report highlighted thatice has been prioritizing deportations and focusing on those with criminal records, resulting in more central americans and fewer mexicans being removed or returned.
2557	in cairo, egypt, members of the muslim brotherhood, a large opposition movement, are feeling increasingly alienated from their own organization. many younger members, like islam lotfy, are dissatisfied with the group's outdated ideology and lack of support for democratic values. lotfy and other young members have formed a new political party, "egyptian trend," in an attempt to bring about real change in the country. despite the potential backlash from the brotherhood's leadership, lotfy remains determined to work towards fulfilling the goals of the revolution, which include ending corruption, social injustice, and increasing civil liberties. the move by the brotherhood's leadership to ostracize members who join competing political parties risks further dividing the organization and highlights the growing tensions within the brotherhood. the obama administration has also expressed interest in engaging with the brotherhood, but the group's leaders have made it clear that they will only work with parties committed to non-violence and democratic values. the situation in egypt remains uncertain as the country prepares for a parliamentary election, with the brotherhood and other opposition groups vying for power.

2565	a 17-month-old boy named kaiba gionfriddo was admitted to a hospital in ohio after he turned blue and stopped breathing. doctors discovered that he had a rare condition called bronchial malacia, which is when the airways in the lungs become damaged and can't function properly. in a last-ditch effort to save kaiba's life, doctors used a 3d printer to create a splint made of biological material that was implanted in his airway. this splint effectively carved a path through kaiba's blocked airway and allowed him to breathe again. this medical procedure is the first of its kind to be used on a human and represents a new frontier in regenerative medicine. the splint was created using a 3d printer, which is able to engineer structures using a powder called polycaprolactone (pcl). pcl is a malleable material that can be fashioned into intricate structures and has been used to fill holes in the skull after brain surgery. the splint was surgically attached to kaiba's collapsed bronchus and within moments of the stitches being put in, kaiba's lung began to inflate and deflate, indicating that the splint was effective. this medical feat has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of respiratory diseases and other conditions where conventional interventions are risky or ineffective.

2574	millions of starfish along the us west coast have been dying off in recent months, worrying biologists who say the sea creatures are key to the marine ecosystem. the most affected species are the purple sea star and sunflower sea star, which can span over a meter in diameter. scientists have observed white lesions on the arms of the sea stars, which spread rapidly and cause the loss of an arm. the mortality rate is estimated at 95%. the cause of the mass deaths is still unknown, but scientists suspect it may be a pathogen, such as a parasite or virus, that compromises the sea stars' immune system. starfish are important to the ecosystem as they help keep mussel populations in check, and when they decline, the mussel population can increase significantly, altering the rocky intertidal zone. scientists are collecting reports from the public, taking specimens to the lab for analysis, and doing genetic sequencing to find the cause of the die-offs.

2576	early voting is changing the way americans cast their ballots and the way campaigns run their operations. many states offer early voting, which allows voters to cast their ballots before election day. this can reduce the impact of the october surprise, as campaigns can no longer count on a last-minute surge of voters. early voting also allows campaigns to focus their efforts on getting out the vote on election day, rather than trying to persuade undecided voters in the final days before the election. additionally, early voting can increase voter participation, especially among special interest groups and those who may have difficulty voting on election day. however, early voting can also be expensive and may not increase overall voter turnout. some states have seen an increase in the number of voters who cast their ballots early, while others have not. the impact of early voting on turnout depends on the state and the type of election.
2577	an advertisement for e45 cream has been criticized for trivializing drug addiction after it portrays a young woman struggling with an addiction to the moisturizer. the advertisement, which parodies an interview with a drug addict, shows the woman confessing to being "hooked" on the product and using it as a daily routine. however, many viewers have found the advertisement to be offensive and exploitative, as it relies on a stereotype of people in recovery and trivializes the serious issue of addiction. the advertising standards authority (asa) has received 60 complaints about the advertisement and will investigate whether it violates the advertising code.

2580	a woman named julie griffiths in the uk has been given an anti-social behavior order (asbo) for keeping her neighbors awake with her constant shouting, swearing, and slamming doors. despite the asbo, griffiths has continued to disturb her street with her behavior, leading to her breaching the order and facing court action. magistrates have imposed a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered her to pay Â£85 costs, but did not impose a prison sentence. griffiths' behavior has been ongoing since 1999, with neighbors describing it as "dreadful." the council has branded griffiths' behavior as "unacceptable" and has vowed to take action to stop it in the future.

2583	several states in the us have passed ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana this month, following the footsteps of colorado, washington, alaska, oregon, and the district of columbia. while florida's medical marijuana law failed to pass with only 58% support, despite 55% voting in favor of it, other states are likely to consider legalization in the next year, including arizona, california, delaware, hawaii, maine, maryland, massachusetts, montana, nevada, new york, rhode island, and vermont. the writer argues that marijuana legalization is a no-brainer and that any society that values liberty should leave adults free to consume marijuana. they also point out that the evidence from states and countries that have decriminalized or medicalized marijuana suggests that policy has a limited impact on use and that the federal government's prohibition creates problems for marijuana businesses and researchers. the writer suggests that the best approach to realizing the full potential of legalization is to remove marijuana from the controlled substances act, which would allow standard regulatory and tax policies to apply to legalized marijuana, and for state and federal governments to impose "sin taxes" on it.

2588	a us senate report has criticized a $1.4 billion information-sharing network of 77 fusion centers, which were set up to combat terrorism after 9/11. the report found that the centers, operated by state and local governments with federal funding, violated americans' civil rights and produced little valuable intelligence on terrorism. the report also found that much of the funding went towards ordinary local crime-fighting, rather than counterterrorism efforts. despite the criticisms, congress is unlikely to cut funding for the program, as it provides politically important money for state and local governments. the report suggests that the program lacks adequate oversight and that there is a lack of coordination between federal and local authorities.

2592	a 14-year-old girl named anais fournier died from caffeine toxicity after consuming two cans of monster energy drink within 24 hours. the family of anais has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against monster beverage corp, alleging that the company failed to warn about the risks of its products. the food and drug administration (fda) is also investigating reports of five deaths and a non-fatal heart attack linked to highly caffeinated monster energy drinks, although the agency has not conclusively proven that the drinks caused the deaths or injuries. monster beverage corp has defended itself against the lawsuit and fda investigation, stating that it does not believe its drinks are responsible for anais' death and that it will vigorously defend itself in the suit. the company's shares plunged 14% in response to the news.
2593	the recent israeli military operation in gaza has raised concerns of a possible ceasefire, with egypt acting as mediator. however, any truce is unlikely to be sustainable without addressing the underlying dysfunctional dynamics within palestinian politics. the conflict has strained relations between egypt and israel, with egypt withdrawing its ambassador from tel aviv and deploying its prime minister to gaza in a show of solidarity with hamas. the us has also been criticized for siding with israel, damaging us-egyptian relations. hamas' military weakening is unlikely to lead to a peaceful resolution, as the group's drive to rearm and resist israel will continue. moreover, any ceasefire agreements must include other stakeholders, such as palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas, who has been marginalized by the crisis. egypt's role as mediator presents an opportunity to rehabilitate abbas and rein in hamas, but any ceasefire agreement must also address the blockade of gaza and the smuggling of weapons into the territory. the crisis has highlighted the lack of a unified palestinian political entity, with both hamas and fatah struggling to assert their authority. a "grand bargain" between the two groups, which do not have to share the same policies or be in the same government, must find a way to share the same political space. this will not be easy, but the risks of continuing to ignore realities are greater. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of khaled elgindy.
2594	a federal judge has ruled that posts on twitter and blogs are protected by the first amendment, even if they appear to be threatening or uncomfortable. the case involved a buddhist leader in maryland who was the subject of over 8,000 tweets and posts containing death threats and other abusive language from a man who had previously befriended her. the judge dismissed the case, finding that the first amendment protects speech even when it challenges conventional beliefs or standards of good taste. however, the judge also noted that the speech must not constitute a true threat, and in this case, the posts did not meet that standard. the ruling has raised concerns about the protection of individuals online, with some arguing that it may be difficult to determine what constitutes a true threat in the age of social media.
2595	a new poll has shown that a third of scottish voters would prefer to see a coalition government between labour and the snp after the may general election, with ed miliband facing the prospect of having to share power with alex salmond. the poll suggests that a majority of scottish voters would prefer a labour-led government, but with the snp as the main partner. the snp has seen a surge in support since the independence referendum, with nicola sturgeon saying she could see the party negotiating a "confidence and supply" arrangement with labour. however, miliband has failed to rule out a coalition with the snp, which could be crucial in securing a labour majority in the general election. the poll results would mean substantial gains for the snp in terms of the number of mps returned to westminster, while labour would suffer significant losses in scotland.

2599	a 49-year-old man who was infected with middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) has died in london, uk, after his condition deteriorated. the man, who was from qatar, had traveled to saudi arabia before being transferred to the uk by air ambulance in september. this death comes after the world health organization (who) declared mers-cov as a "threat to the entire world" in may, as the virus has already caused severe disease in multiple countries and persisted in the middle east since 2012. experts are concerned that the disease is "emerging faster than our understanding" and have advised british health officials to be vigilant for severe unexplained respiratory illness in anyone who has recently traveled to the middle east. mers-cov is more deadly than sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which caused hundreds of deaths in previous outbreaks around the world.
2600	according to a report by migrationwatch uk, immigration has been responsible for 84% of the uk's population growth over the last century, with 3.8 million of the 4.6 million population rise between 2001 and 2012 attributed to immigration. the report suggests that the office for national statistics (ons) underestimated the scale of immigration by not counting children born to foreign parents as migrants. migrationwatch uk used official data to come to this conclusion, while the ons bases its estimate on a different definition of immigration. the ons has previously stated that 57% of the uk's population increase since 2001 is due to immigration, but migrationwatch uk argues that this figure is much higher when accounting for children born to migrants already in the country. the report also criticizes the ons's prediction that 60% of future population growth will be due to migration, calling it a "serious understatement" as it does not account for the future children of migrants already in the country.
2601	in this year's ig nobel awards, which is an annual event that recognizes strange and unusual scientific discoveries, several winners were announced in various categories. the categories included psychology, biology, physics, and peace, among others. some of the notable winners include: * psychology prize: researchers found that people who think they are drunk also think they are attractive. in fact, the higher a person's blood alcohol level, the higher their attractiveness rating. this experiment was conducted by laurent bÃ¨gue, oulmann zerhouni, baptiste subra, medhi orabah, and brad bushman. * biology and astronomy prize: a study on dung beetles found that they can use the milky way to find their way home, even when the moon isn't visible. this discovery was made by marie dacke, emily baird, marcus byrne, clarke scholtz, and eric warrant. * medicine prize: researchers discovered that mice with heart transplants lived longer after listening to verdi's opera. specifically, the mice that listened to la traviata survived for an average of 27 days, compared to the control group which survived an average of 7 days. * engineering prize: a patent was awarded for an "anti-hijacking device" that involves an electro-mechanical system to trap an airplane hijacker by dropping them through a trap door, sealing them into a package, and dropping the package from the plane attached to a parachute. * other winners included: + probability prize: researchers found that once a cow stands up, it is now easy to predict how soon that cow will lie down again. however, the longer a cow has been lying down, the more likely it is that the cow will stand up. + public health prize: medical techniques were described for managing an epidemic of penile amputations
2602	comet ison, dubbed the "comet of the century," was thought to have disintegrated as it flew close to the sun, but recent images from nasa and the european space agency suggest that it may have survived. the comet was spotted on a trajectory towards the sun on thursday, but then bright lights were seen that some scientists claim could be the comet's nucleus. initially, scientists were unsure if the comet had already started to disintegrate, as it entered the sun's hottest outer layers where it was exposed to temperatures of several million degrees. however, if the comet has survived, it may be visible to the naked eye through december, at least from the northern hemisphere. the comet has already been bright enough for astronomers to capture amazing pictures, and if it has survived, it may have a huge and impressively long tail with a brightness that could be seen even with the naked eye.
2603	according to conservative historian lee edwards, there have been both good and bad vice presidential picks in recent years. edwards ranked the picks since the 1950s and placed dick cheney at #5 on the list of good vice picks due to his washington experience and ability to bring stability to the bush ticket. richard nixon came in at #4, bringing youth and political experience from california to the nixon ticket. al gore came in at #3 for his washington experience and ability to balance the clinton ticket. george h.w. bush was ranked #2 for uniting the republican party after running against ronald reagan in the primaries. lyndon b. johnson took the #1 spot for being the most successful vice presidential pick, selected by john f. kennedy to balance him out in the south in 1960. the worst vice picks according to edwards include dan quayle (#2), who became a laughingstock due to his lack of experience and embarrassing moments during the 1988 debate; spiro agnew (#3), who pleaded guilty to tax evasion and money laundering after taking office; and thomas eagleton (#4), who was dropped as mcgovern's running mate after revelations about his mental health.
2604	two fire chiefs and two poultry farm bosses have been sentenced to prison terms of up to nine years for their roles in a deadly fire at a plant in northeastern china that killed 121 people. the fire, which occurred in june 2013, highlighted continuing safety violations in the country despite recent improvements. the plant, which produced 67,000 tons of processed chicken per year, had a complicated design with narrow corridors, blocked exits, and a lack of proper safety measures. survivors reported struggling to escape through smoke and flames, with some escaping through windows or being carried out by firefighters. two fire chiefs were convicted of abuse of power for falsifying information after the fire, and the poultry farm bosses were sentenced for installing substandard equipment. the fire killed 121 people and injured 76 others, many of whom were women workers.
2605	a 37-year-old man in london has been arrested on suspicion of making roadside bombs in iraq in 2007. the metropolitan police's counter-terrorism command arrested the man at his home in the northwest of the capital and continue to search his property. the man remains in custody at a south london police station while the search continues. the uk military vehicles were targeted by roadside bombs in 2006, leading to the deaths of two soldiers. the use of improvised explosive devices (ieds) was a significant threat during the iraq war (2003-2011) and accounted for nearly two-thirds of all deaths suffered by american and british forces and their allies. the bombs were often placed in unusual locations, such as drinks cans, food boxes, and animal carcasses, to hide them from approaching troops. insurgents used various tactics, including using buses and lorries to slow down military vehicles, and donkey carts loaded with explosives, to attack coalition forces. the use of ieds led to changes in the design of british armoured cars and jeeps to better protect soldiers from the blasts. the conflict in iraq also led to a surge in sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007, despite the deployment of thousands of extra us troops, and raised fears of attacks in the uk.

2811	scientists have been trying to detect dark matter directly for several decades, but despite significant efforts, they have not been successful until now. researchers from leiden university in the netherlands have found evidence of dark matter in neighboring galaxies by detecting photon emissions that could not be explained by any known form of matter. the signal, which was found using the european space agency's xmm-newton telescope, corresponds to the expected distribution of dark matter in galaxies and is concentrated in the center with a weaker signal on the edges. the discovery is significant because it could lead to a new era in astronomy and provide insight into the formation of the universe. the researchers analyzed x-ray signals emitted by the perseus galaxy cluster and the andromeda galaxy, and they found an anomaly that could not be attributed to any known form of matter. they then looked at data from our own galaxy, the milky way, and made the same observations. the detection of this signal is a rare event in the universe, known as a photon emission due to the destruction of a hypothetical particle, possibly a sterile neutrino. the discovery, if confirmed, could lead to the construction of new telescopes specifically designed to study the signals from dark matter particles. the research is being published in physical review letters and includes scientists from epfl. the discovery of dark matter could provide new insights into the formation of the universe and the structure of galaxies.

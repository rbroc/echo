1	A: suddenly the "great outdoors" isn't so appealing. let's hike a little faster ...
2	B: thank you for coming. we will have dinner outside. eat up!
3	B: they usually do.
4	B: i don't know.
5	B: yes, but i'll bet she won't again.
6	B: you are really a wet blanket.
7	A: nice to meet you, too.
8	B: i told you so.
9	A: yes, ' foreign exchange registration ', for bank drafts, bills of exchange and so on. also, approval of rib accounts, capital verification and so on.
10	B: i was an office boy.
11	A: nice! let ' s go!
12	A: this will fix all of that for you. if you use our online payment service, the money will come straight out of your account and go directly into the seller's account, in a secure way.
13	B: here's my passport. is that ok?
14	A: i will.
15	B: oh, i just can't forget it.
16	A: just call me alex. alex and alexander are the same thing.
17	B: when i asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters, he jumped down my throat. so i took it out on him by telling him what i thought.
18	B: i hear ya. let's do it.
19	B: i'm so sorry. a lid comes with the pan. here it is.
20	A: it's so nice of you.
21	A: i will. thank you.
22	B: i think Â£5 would be good.
23	A: i bet it's may 5th.
24	A: that' s a perfect plan. enjoy yourself.
25	A: great. i am your lucky fellow then.
26	B: hold on a second, please.
27	B: oh, thank you. your skirt looks beautiful, too.
28	B: yummy! yummy! eat more!
29	B: you're welcome.
30	B: that sounds great. thanks.
31	A: that's a good idea. let's see if we can get more people in this plan. there isn't much business these days anyway, so i think many people will be interested.
32	A: that' s okay, i' ll take the stairs!
33	B: yes. no need to change.
34	A: all right. let's go to the square to have a look.
35	B: i can if you like.
36	B: sorry, i'll try to speak louder.
37	B: great! this calls for a celebration.
38	B: sure, here you are.
39	A: oh, i'll have a try.
40	B: what's the big deal?
41	B: thank you.
42	B: maybe you'll call his home.
43	B: thank you. if you have any problems, just call.
44	B: you can tell them: please finding the enclosed customer service survey, else also, you can say attach a customer survey. if you need resource it right away, you can tell them the urgent by saying please return the survey without dely as soon as possible. maye it more polite with this as early as convenience.
45	B: so there is something wrong with her! it was beginning to sound like she was too good to be true!
46	A: i hope so.
47	B: no, i couldn't care less!
48	A: thanks so much.
49	B: now i want you to look some pictures.
50	A: i am an engineer in a mechanized farm.
51	B: you'd better wait. the gums are swollen. take the medicine i prescribe and come back in three days.
52	B: look, the reason i came into your store is because i was spending the day with annabell and matt. and i was buying them presents. i' m the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative. and there' s only one place to find a children' s book in the neighborhood. that will not always be the case. and it was yours. and it is a charming little bookstore. you probably sell what 350,000 worth of books in a year.
53	B: well, it's good in style, but i am afraid it doesn't wash well.
54	B: that sounds great. i'll bring a bottle of wine.
55	A: i hope so.
56	B: yes, but he should bush it off as if it were not a big deal to him.
57	A: this afternoon.
58	B: i worked in the infection medicine division.
59	A: but it's unfair for jane.
60	B: not always, she's rather busy at the end of the year.
61	B: i thought she would marry a fortune.
62	B: i have a proven track record in resolving problems, multitasking, and dealing with customers, as you can sec in my resume. i think it is enough.
63	A: indoors activities, such as chess and gymnastics.
64	A: actually me, too.
65	B: really? congratulations.
66	B: after you've solved this problem for me.
67	B: it's really hard to avoid such bad influence anyway.
68	A: yes, i'd like to know the exchange rate for yen.
69	B: thank you. i appreciate the compliment.
70	A: ok. i' ll let you know when i' ve sorted out my clothes.
71	B: thanks.
72	B: now we are prepared to settle the issue with you amicably.
73	A: no thanks.
74	A: well, you' d better get another pair for work at least or you' re sacking on the spot.
75	B: sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily.
76	A: sounds great
77	B: great idea. and after all, that's the whole point of an evaluation. i almost can't wait to give it a try.
78	A: then i will simply have to invite all the robinson' s over for dinner on thursday.
79	B: don't get drunk.
80	B: i should say, it stunned me. i can't imagine what they will think of next.
81	B: what do you do there ... hang around, like the kids?
82	A: not at all.
83	B: that's a good idea.
84	A: if you need any help, let me know.
85	B: i promise.
86	A: it's ok. don't worry about it. our school coach will train us to play basketball.
87	A: i think you're right. thank you.
88	B: that's fine too.
89	A: maybe i'll have to face the music.
90	B: of course. i will find you one.
91	A: please wrap it.
92	B: read it yourself and find out!
93	B: that sounds great. give me a call next time you guys play.
94	B: oh, that is a shame. he is really hard working.
95	A: well i wish you luck.
96	B: you are right.
97	A: thanks your flatter.
98	B: here's your key, sir. if you need anything, just dial 0 on your room phone.
99	B: so the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life?
100	B: yes, please. thank you for everything.
101	B: that' s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves, to reduce water loss.
102	A: i wish you could make a reconsideration. if you don't reduce your price, we won't purchase from you any more because there's plenty of other business offering here.
103	B: yes. i wrote a thesis entitled on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy and it was published in china daily.
104	B: you're right! so i can listen to music while riding my motorbike!
105	A: ok. please wait for s while. we'll get it done quickly!
106	B: if you discover a small fire, you can try to put it out with a fire extinguisher but only do this if you have been trained. make sure you use the right extinguisher. they are all colour-coded and contain different substances to put out the fire.
107	B: i will give it a try at once.
108	B: you' re welcome, ma' am. i' ll call you when they' re ready.
109	B: no. there's no call-out fee. it's included in the annual service contract.
110	B: what a pity.
111	B: yes. thank you for inviting me.
112	A: it is serious.
113	B: sometimes they are too independent.
114	B: i learned about different tax laws and how they work.
115	B: i'm planning on going, but i really need her to give me my invitation.
116	B: yes, it's great for cleaning up spills.
117	A: this is all your medicine. you need to take it four times a day for three days straight.
118	A: thanks for the offer, but i think i've got it. hopefully, i won't get lost again on my way there!
119	B: i' m glad to hear that.
120	B: that' s more like it!
121	B: ok. please arrive at seven forty-five. we can only hold the table until 8,15.
122	B: fine, we'll be expecting you then.
123	A: it's greek to me.
124	B: oh! it's so cute!
125	A: thank you.
126	A: what? i thought you liked patricia.
127	B: yeah, it was scary, but exhilarating.
128	B: you have lots of friends. they will be there, too!
129	A: can you bring me something? i am totally hooked on this game!
130	B: no, i think i'm going to go to the movies.
131	B: right here. me and my pc. home sweet home.
132	B: ok, i completely understand.
133	A: i appreciate your help.
134	A: i really appreciate your help.
135	B: i think i sometimes try to be over-organized. so i am learning how to let some things go and concentrate on the most important part of my job.
136	B: goodbye.
137	A: i see.
138	B: you can easily download it from their website.
139	B: yes. no need to change.
140	A: i'd like a gin and tonic.
141	A: yes, please.
142	B: cut out, would you?
143	B: it' s the worst thing i' ve ever tried.
144	A: i don' t want to hear it! now go to your room!
145	B: don't be silly, forget about it.
146	A: i really appreciate all your help.
147	B: be careful.
148	B: it sure is.he has no one to turn to, very miserable indeed.
149	A: these machines aren't very difficult to use. in fact, i quite like them. they are much faster than dealing with a band clerk.
150	B: you're welcome.
151	B: excellent, come over at ten o'clock and we will start at the shopping center, the one around the corner from my house. they have just the shop we need.
152	A: all right. yes, he does. the registration fee is 7 yuan, please.
153	B: on the contrary, very exciting.
154	B: all under the precept of keeping the funding? that stinks.
155	B: nope, lost again. but, it was a good game.
156	B: this is gonna be a great barbecue!
157	A: of course, it' s not polite of them, but sometimes you should put things the other way round and try to understand them.
158	B: chocolate is mine.
159	B: wow! you're right! this refrigerator is great. i'll take it.
160	B: they pay well enough.
161	B: that' s it. you can get dressed when the film is developed.
162	A: i said i am informing you of the interview.
163	B: but there won't be anything good left.
164	B: yeah, i agree with you. but you know, it' s just one of those things.
165	A: oh, i seem to lose something every time i travel.
166	B: you're welcome.
167	B: wow, i doubt that.
168	B: no problem. see you next monday.
169	A: ok, please wait for a moment.
170	B: and if we don't need them, we won't need zina, either.
171	B: i was in new york for a wedding.
172	A: oh, i see.
173	B: ok. i' ll make enquiries.
174	B: the situation differs in person.
175	B: but i don't think much of it.
176	B: don't mention it.
177	B: ok. i'll take it.
178	A: mm. i've seen him a couple of times, i think.
179	A: there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too.
180	B: be confident. wear styles you' re going to be comfortable in.
181	A: sir, wait! ! i need your address!
182	B: yes, it is.but it's nice in spring and fall.
183	B: that's a problem.
184	B: here are your ticket and change.
185	B: i like all kinds as long as they are exciting.
186	B: just think of it as a hobby. then it's actually fun.
187	B: then it must be a naughty boy who did it.
188	B: i agree. that' s why christopher is already looking for a job in maine, or wisconsin.
189	B: there you go.
190	B: only if you pay your fine.
191	A: yes, i will.
192	B: you said it.
193	A: seems like it.
194	B: yes, i speak a little french and japanese.
195	B: ok.
196	B: i promise you'll have it tomorrow.
197	B: tell me if you need help.
198	A: of course. they will be used at anytime before or during flight.
199	B: you are welcome.
200	B: sure, anytime.
201	B: i spent a year to get my license.
202	A: thank you.
203	B: i'll take it.
204	A: i'm glad to hear it.
205	B: no problem.
206	B: it' s a good thing that you read that ad today.
207	B: yes, please.we need a record of you education and your work experiences.
208	A: i had a great time. it' ll be good to see them again.
209	B: probably in a week or two. i'll let you know.
210	B: no, that' s all. thanks.
211	B: i would take it. after all, interest is not the only thing one should care about.
212	B: fine, thanks. how about you?
213	B: better hurry, sir. remember you have to check out in less than half an hour.
214	B: let me have a look at the pamphlet.
215	A: it' s up on the second floor. you have to use the stairs. the elevator isn' t working.
216	A: well, honey. turn off the light, lie down and go to sleep.
217	A: i guess so.
218	B: run! they are thirsty for more!
219	B: ok, let's go.
220	B: that's because you are always fixing your eyes on the bald.
221	A: yeah, and the funniest thing was, that he jumped on to his chair and started shrieking like a girl. you had to be there! everyone was staring and laughing ... it was hilarious!
222	A: it' s a pleasure to meet you, miss green.
223	B: i prefer the old style of dance because i enjoy holding a pretty girl like you closely.
224	A: such an eye! the true hazel eye-and so brilliant! regular features, open countenance, with a complexion, oh! what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure! there is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her glance. one hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health '; now, she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health. she is loveliness itself.
225	B: that's great and it was your first try.
226	B: i am a realist.
227	B: they are.we definitely see eye-to eye on my enhanced performance being a win-win situation for everyone involved.
228	A: my roommate's having a party.
229	B: good luck!
230	B: $ 150 including the cloth.
231	B: oh, dear! i'll do well i can.
232	B: yes, they are.
233	B: yeah, i' m dealing with it. anyway. thank you, mike.
234	A: right.
235	B: i am a good accountant and have a thorough knowledge of the english language.
236	B: what a pity!
237	A: she's 42.
238	A: yes, i am.
239	B: i am going to send you for a ct scan, and i will see you again when we see the results.
240	A: sorry, i've no idea.
241	B: ok. see you.
242	B: it depends. in some poor, underdeveloped areas, children's education is a problem. many kids cannot afford to go to school.
243	B: around 3:30.
244	B: personally. i think that people believe they will be healed and that faith causes a change in their mind that cures them. i don' t think place is magical in any way.
245	B: that happens to be my favorite. waiter, i think we're ready to order.
246	B: sorry, sir. we have only tables in the main dinning room left.
247	B: that' ll help you make more money.
248	B: ok. thank you.
249	B: thanks for the information. and good luck in your college search.
250	B: i have been feeling great. i don' t imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly.
251	B: certainly, sir.
252	B: yes. twice.
253	A: i appreciate the saying ' love consists in this, that two solitude protect, border and salute each other. '
254	A: yes, i did. it was one of the conditions of the insurance police. the insurance companies need to assess the risk
255	A: it's on the service counter over there.
256	B: i'd like to, but i must run to a meeting.
257	A: yeah, falling in love is so good.
258	B: i hope not.
259	A: well. how do you know?
260	B: thank you. good-bye.
261	B: of course. we are already out of our motherland.
262	B: sure. join my class next week.
263	B: that's for sure.
264	B: see you then!
265	B: no comment.
266	B: thank you very much for taking your time. i' m still deciding. i will call you tomorrow.
267	B: it's fantastic!
268	B: it is so encouraging to hear this remark. the secret is to make plans. write down your goals, short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month. then just work hard.
269	A: may i have your name?
270	A: but if the company asks, what else can we do?
271	A: thanks, bye.
272	A: oh, yes, i would!
273	B: most of them in this store are from mexico.
274	B: very good. it's a pleasure to do business with you, mrs. phoebe.
275	B: that's true.
276	B: hehe .. sure
277	B: i have a test tomorrow.
278	A: just throw them away!
279	B: you have the right to remain silent.
280	B: yes.
281	B: i think that the doctor had better see you. i'll telephone dr carter. the doctor says that he will come at once. i'm sure that you need an x-ray, andy.
282	A: both the green tea and the black tea are good for our health. and i usually refresh myself with a cup of tea.
283	B: by now, the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will accept. it will go quickly.
284	B: well, we can't break tradition! it's bad luck!
285	A: bye.
286	A: sorry, that' s out of question. i don' t have a problem with it. but, unfortunately, the building doesn' t allow it. it' s a building regulation.
287	B: ok, mum. i'll invite my friends home.
288	B: all cleaned up. are you ready to start on the washing up.
289	B: april the first is coming.be careful!
290	B: first i need to get your address. try to move your arm as little as possible.
291	A: that' s not the end. they were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck.
292	A: i'll take it.
293	A: sure. here it is.
294	A: thank you very much. come back to see us.
295	A: that' s all right.
296	B: no, i haven't.
297	B: sounds like you've done your homework. i think you're ready for this.
298	A: wow! i' m very excited about your ceremony.
299	B: oh, she is going to be a great mother.
300	A: thanks.
301	B: i see.
302	B: i don't think so actually. she never even says "hello" to me.
303	B: see you then.
304	A: thanks to global warming, it could be hotter than ever!
305	B: you' re such a geek!
306	B: fine. i will be there around two. if someone is not there, i will use my key to get in.
307	A: you are welcome, goodbye.
308	B: bye.
309	B: but they don't let you have goods on approval.
310	A: yes. such people don' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs.
311	B: not at all. a party is a party. i' ll be happy to come.
312	A: it is said that the sample 25 is the standard for others. it's complete. so would you like to sign the contract right now?
313	B: exactly.
314	B: all you need is your student identification card to check out books.
315	A: it's just near the dong si shi tiao subway stop.
316	A: i see. there was also the famous ping pong diplomacy, wasn't there?
317	B: she's not good at remembering things. we have a date, and she's an hour late! !
318	B: got it.
319	A: i know, but i forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.
320	B: what a strange guy!
321	B: ok, i'll listen to you.
322	B: great minds think alike.
323	B: i can give you quarters, if that'll help.
324	A: i actually try to avoid name-brand items. i can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place!
325	B: she is really something.
326	A: so, that's one "fried rice, hangzhou style", one "fruit salad" and two bottles of carlsborg beer. we'll send them to your room in 20 minutes.
327	B: i promise i will take the first chance to call on you. please send your wife with my best regards.
328	A: all right, mr. smith. i'll be sure he gets your message.
329	B: ok.
330	A: yes, and then other qualitative factors, such as the transparency of your business operations, your credibility and the integrity of your management.
331	B: a couple of times a week. i've got a regular dancing partner. he is really some dancer
332	B: it's delicious.
333	B: no problem.
334	A: me, too.
335	B: i guess so.
336	B: the place is ok. let's go there and have a look at it again.
337	B: if i were you, i'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide. whatever you do, i know you'll succeed.
338	A: good luck!
339	B: that seems like a good idea, it's for wages, you see.
340	A: hang in there. it' ll all come together one of these days.
341	B: yes. i have got two articles in english in the international youth writer's collection.
342	B: nice to see you, too, steven. goodbye.
343	B: you are welcome.
344	A: hello. i' m calling about the one bedroom in lincoln park. could i take a look at it? yes. tonight at six is fine. thanks.
345	B: no problem.
346	B: don't tell me you have a record player!
347	B: i have booked you for one window seat on american airline flight no. 409. have a good trip!
348	B: you are in good shape. figuring in your other expenses, you can easily afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more!
349	B: i think that i will.
350	B: you won't be late. it's still early.
351	B: that would be great. i would love some.
352	B: yes, what's your name?
353	B: just do your best and i am sure that you will see improvement.
354	B: see you.
355	A: i don't see why we can't work on opening new markets and developing the markets we've already penetrated at the same time ... both aspects of developing our customer base and developing our brand are important.
356	A: not at all.
357	A: you are welcome.
358	A: it is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active.
359	B: anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone, you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol!
360	A: just a moment, please.
361	A: fine. thank you.
362	B: his mother, not me, should do this.
363	B: i am too introverted to let others become my friends.
364	A: my i have your name, please, sir?
365	A: ok!
366	B: ok, i see. dear daniel, please come to the broadcasting station when you've heard this, your mother is waiting for you. if other tourists see a boy in a blue sportswear and a pair of white sportsshoes, 1.4 meters, please ask him to go to the broadcasting station. thank you!
367	B: certainly. we always have the interest of the customers at heart.
368	B: hopefully we won't have any more blackouts.
369	A: i just cann't believe my ears!
370	A: like you and me!
371	A: mmmm. they smell nice.
372	B: no, i'm afraid that's it.
373	B: great! i have a coupon for free popcorn at that theater!
374	B: hope you feel better.
375	B: really? quite a woman, isn' t she?
376	B: it looks more like a toy, or a cool briefcase!
377	A: where's the peeler?
378	A: yes, you' re right. good night.
379	B: you' re welcome.
380	A: see you soon! bye! egg ... i can' t stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter.
381	B: yes, please.
382	B: sure.
383	B: sure you can, in about two and a half weeks.
384	A: that's a good idea!
385	B: just go to read. i will find it, honey.
386	A: of course. everything's so striking and fascinating.
387	A: thank you, mr. william. goodbye.
388	B: that's good to know. thanks for your help today, i'll leave you with the details and you can get started.
389	A: what an interesting family!
390	A: oh, you men! you are all the same.
391	B: great. i would like that.
392	B: of course, i should have been more careful. i' m sorry.
393	A: that is very kind of you. thank you very much.
394	B: whatever, i' m going to go watch the opening match.
395	A: thanks a lot, eve. goodbye.
396	B: of course it does. everybody has his own hobby.
397	A: fine. the housekeeper will open the door and stay in the room with the repairmen.
398	A: you know, speaking in class is a very good chance to put your english to practical use.
399	A: all right, sir. please reconfirm your ticket no later than 12 o'clock two days before the flight; otherwise, your reservation will automatically be cancelled.
400	A: good.you really know how to enjoy yourself.
401	B: oh, let's hope so.
402	B: sure, please give me $ 10 in advance. l wil have them bought for you.
403	B: i'm going to have to do some more research into this. thanks for your help, bye for now.
404	B: of course.
405	A: of course, madam.
406	A: you can ask me any question at any time.
407	B: well, it could be me too. but i am not too worried. this place is suffocating me with this boss being such a hard-ass and colleagues who barely know how to get dressed in the morning. it would almost be a blessing to be fired from this place.
408	B: i couldn't care less.
409	A: that's so true. it's great that we see eye to eye on this.
410	B: that's amazing! really? how could it change so much in two days?
411	B: me too.
412	B: thank you. i'll work hard.
413	B: yes. we all loved the celebration of our city's birthday. it made the people feel so proud of our city.
414	A: administer is doing a good job. i'm not sure they'll be as happy as we are.
415	A: well, take care of yourself.
416	A: silly boy! the dustbin is at the back of the school. now pick up the paperand put it in the dustbiri.
417	B: on and off, for quite a few years.
418	A: i'm sorry to hear that.
419	A: can't you see the notes there? it says no smoking here.
420	B: you're welcome.
421	B: excellent! that sounds like a plan.
422	B: ok then. we shall ask them to put some red chilli on it.
423	B: thank you for inviting me. see you then. bye, tom.
424	A: don't worry about it.
425	A: yes, and i want to have a try.
426	B: an option we can offer is two separate shipments.we will house the inventory until you are ready for us to ship it to you.
427	B: that 'll be ninety-five cents in all.
428	B: first of all, i hope to spend a few years working in some famous companies to command a skill, to set a solid foundation and to build my interpersonal network. when i feel i have accumulated enough experience, i hope to own an undertaking. of course this is up to the situation then and the opportunities the companies offer me. in the long run, i hope to be an entrepreneur.
429	A: what's more, it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company.
430	B: it's not too late. go to buy some now.
431	B: it really doesn't matter at all. i never did like it anyway.
432	B: thank you very much.
433	A: that's not a problem. have a nap if you can. you don't know how tight the schedule is for this business trip.
434	A: that's completely natural. most of our customers do the same thing. could you just hold for a moment please? thank you.
435	B: you're just jealous.
436	A: how silly john is.
437	B: because the traffic is not crowded.
438	A: you are my best friend. that's what i should do. please don' t be a stranger.
439	B: and i taught him how to swim in the sea. it was fun and made him braver than before. after we returned home, he wasn't afraid to sleep alone in his bedroom.
440	B: have a great trip.
441	B: great! phew! that was a close one! you had me going there for a minute i thought i was gonna have to slap some sense into you.
442	B: don't worry about it. all in all, you've done very well in school.
443	B: i'm sure you have a talent. it's just hidden.
444	A: thanks a lot.
445	B: it was a pleasure. come back anytime.
446	B: hmm. you' ve got mail.
447	A: good luck to them.
448	B: well, we can do nothing about it.
449	A: thank you.
450	B: i'm sorry, sir.the price is fixed.
451	B: i was born on april 15, 1986.
452	B: i know i need to learn that myself, but i just don't have the money for it at the moment. living at home allows me to save up some money before i started finding a place.
453	B: well, take care of yourself, and don't say i didn't warn you.
454	B: yeah, he has no children, so he sometimes feel s very lonely. i often go to his house to play and talk with him. that makes him feel very happy.
455	B: you're welcome, sir.
456	B: these are from guatemala, but we're going to start getting mangoes from india.
457	B: you are welcome. goodbye.
458	B: yeah, i' m with you on that.
459	B: but i'd prefer to stay at home and have a good rest.
460	B: i've got whiskey and brandy but i need some beer and soda.that ' s all.
461	B: don' t mention it.
462	A: of course not, it is made of pure silk.
463	B: that' s all i need today. thanks.
464	A: take your time, sir. i can wait.
465	B: okay, let's go!
466	A: i left after the opening dance. i couldn't wait to get out of there.
467	A: is says here that it' s a war memorial. now, there' s a distinctive structure-the stomium in brussels. see? it consists of several connected by cylinders. i believe you can go up and down inside it.
468	A: hey! i thought you weren't interested! sorry, i've gotta go! i'm going to switch over to ebay and see if my bid is still the highest.
469	B: fine.
470	B: i did actually but i think i met some of the friendliest people in china. they soon showed me the way!
471	B: oh, really? thanks a lot ... well, i still have a lot to learn, i guess.
472	B: it's my favorite.
473	A: no problem. here it is.
474	A: thanks a lot!
475	B: no problem. thank you for hiring me, i am very proud to be employed by your company and i will come in at eight o' clock sharp monday.
476	B: certainly.just a moment, sir.
477	B: yes, you can see every test for the past five years. you can compare them.
478	B: i think i can manage that. let's see ... yes, here we are.
479	A: let me see. well, i'd like onion soup. thank you.
480	B: that's neat!
481	B: oh really ... well you must be very popular on the internet. but it's true that it's nice to do some things in the comfort of your own home.
482	B: hope so.
483	B: i think i would like that.
484	B: it would be a really good choice. the movie is very suitable for lovers to see together. i'm sure you won't regret it.
485	B: for me? the football games of course, i love football games.
486	A: may be i can have a try. but i'm on vacation now.
487	B: yes, electricity is not included in the rent.
488	B: of course i know that. but don't you notice that the house price is skyrocketing?
489	A: sure. in the middle part of the fifth street, there is a phoenix restaurant. maybe you can go there.
490	A: good night.
491	B: bottom's up, and you're right. this meal is incredible. i wish i had known this restaurant before. thanks for bringing me here. i know i'll be back soon.
492	A: uh huh ... but we're going to have to cut back on our shopping from now on.
493	B: that's an excellent idea.
494	B: don't worry. anyway, you are better than me.
495	B: ok.
496	A: yes, of course, ms chan.
497	A: no problem. bye, bye.
498	B: yes, he is.
499	A: ok, thanks.
500	B: great!
501	B: maybe you are right. well, you can talk with them.
502	A: yes, you have 2 weeks paid vacation a year, and you get it additional week after 4 years, and then again, after 9 years if you decide to stay that long, we promote from within based on performance, so there is an excellent chance that you could become a sales manager or even a region manager.
503	B: you can discover interviewer's eyes because they can show his thoughts, and can judge whether he is interested in your words by his gesture and mien.
504	B: thanks.
505	B: no, that' s perfect. we can leave directly from here.
506	B: ok, i see.
507	A: i will.
508	B: i did ... i just hope i can implement all these great ideas that we shared.
509	B: it means there must be no naked flames or sparks anywhere near flammable materials. if the materials ignite, it could cause a serious fire and the fumes they give off can be very dangerous if you inhale them.
510	B: around 6 o'clock.
511	B: that' d be fine.
512	B: thanks a lot.
513	A: thank you.
514	B: don' t mention it.
515	A: a bottle of champagne.
516	B: sounds not bad! better performance isn' t just about doing a lot more. it is about focusing on the right things to do.
517	A: not yet.
518	A: you' d better tidy up the room now, or you' ll get your mum' s back up.
519	B: looking forward to meeting with you!
520	B: that doesn't sound like a good choice for today though. let's order!
521	A: when was the palace built?
522	B: sounds good.
523	B: that is all right.
524	B: that sounds great. give me a call next time you guys play.
525	A: but don't worry. you can get off at the next stop and walk back. it's not far.
526	B: you' ll be lucky! however, i' ll print out the information i got from the internet and you can do it yourself.
527	A: yes. we could do that for you.
528	B: he's going to make the opening speech.
529	A: thanks.
530	B: oh, yes, i do. my present job is similar in that respect, and i think i' m doing a good job.
531	B: sure, he's ready to be friendly with anyone.
532	B: i put all of that information in the packet. i'll give you another copy if you need one. see you on monday!
533	B: yes, to tell you the truth. i am on the diet.
534	A: good-bye!
535	B: you can try it on in the fitting room over there.
536	B: yes. let me get you a pair.
537	B: wait a minute. let me throw on a sweater.
538	B: oh, really, i thought it was a sign of rain.
539	B: but the brazilian is tougher.
540	B: the secret is persistence.
541	B: you're right.
542	B: at least 20 days.
543	A: honey, cross my heart, i'v never looked at another woman since the first day i set my eyes on you! believe me, that's the truth.
544	B: ok. let's go
545	B: yeah. anytime.
546	B: yeah, she is great. i also admire her for her concern about society.
547	B: job fairs are popular places to look for work.
548	A: it' s a traditional scottish delicacy; you take sheep' s liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep' s stomach.
549	B: although we have many things in common, we'are not soul mates.
550	B: no, a no. 50 will take you right there.
551	B: my expectation is in the 3800 to 4500 rib range. that' s the take-home pay.
552	B: she should be very pleased with these roses.
553	B: yes, of course. i will book the tour.
554	B: yes, and i look many pictures.
555	A: you' re welcome
556	A: that's my good girl. the clothes need washing. i'll do the laundry.
557	B: she's going to kill you.
558	B: yes, over there to your left.
559	B: thank you.
560	A: certainly.
561	B: easier said than done.
562	A: that' s a good idea! the kitchen will look amazing!
563	B: thanks. i'll read through it tonight and get back to you tomorrow to sign up for a course.
564	B: you'd have a revolution on your hands if you tried to introduce that sort of system here.
565	B: that's good to know, because i do travel quite frequently.
566	B: well, you know that this job center is here for your use, so help yourself. good luck!
567	B: yes. i'd like to visit france. i'd like to travel all over the world. as you describe it, france seems to be very much like japan. i would like to see it for myself.
568	B: really? what about your opinion, daniel?
569	A: what!
570	A: i'm totally with you on that.
571	A: that's definitely true. i'm going to have to give you a ticket. please remember to drive more carefully next time.
572	B: why don' t you marry rose, then?
573	A: well, when you tell him, be gentle. it' s hard for kids to find out something like that.
574	B: let me take a look. just a second. that' s no problem, susan. see you on wednesday.
575	B: it comes to $ 15.
576	A: thanks a lot!
577	B: i agree. we will leave $ 3.60 for the tip.
578	B: ok, thank you.
579	A: there are so many ancient relics in china.
580	A: you are welcome.
581	A: thank you. i'll bring your order right away.
582	B: that'd be nice.
583	B: mum, when will we have them again?
584	B: wow! i'm so happy for you.
585	B: at once, sir. you'll love this place, i assure you.
586	B: is this the information here? well, let's take a look then ...
587	B: i will. see you later.
588	B: because everyone is trying to butter him up.
589	A: that comes to h. k. $ 120.
590	B: sure. it's an issue asking for everyone's participation.
591	B: $ 10.
592	A: it seems to me that you always do better than you say.
593	B: and the bank will offer you loans for twenty years!
594	A: ok, sounds good. but i think it's your trick.
595	B: while staying in love is even better.
596	B: that's it.
597	B: let' s go downtown and pick up some fashionable clothes for you.
598	A: you are right. for the past few weeks, i had no appetite and couldn' t sleep well. what' s worse my back started aching this monday. it is time for me to take a vacation.
599	B: i bought it when i was on vacation in nepal.
600	A: well, you have three hearts â lucky in love tonight. dress up and go on a date!
601	B: i think so. but can i try another one? i don't like the color.
602	B: ok, it's no anything. do what you should do.
603	A: yeah, i'm in the office till 10 every night. i can't take it anymore. the pay just isn't worth it.
604	B: sometime next month.
605	B: whew! thanks, karen. that car almost hit me.
606	B: oh, i'll try to catch it.
607	B: you bet. you should try it yourself.
608	B: they come from tropical countries.
609	B: i see. ok.
610	A: a well-learned person never does that.
611	B: it is stupid to say so.
612	B: all right. i' ll call you back later.
613	B: definitely not, sir.
614	A: thank you. that would be great.
615	B: thank you. just a moment, please.
616	A: ok, i'll be with you in a moment.
617	B: smart.
618	B: i will. thanks for your advice.
619	A: i have an appointment at one fifteen.
620	A: ok.now you can pick your fabric and pattern design. please follow me.
621	B: yes and maybe a jacket in case it gets cool.
622	A: sure, a studio would be fine.
623	B: take it easy. i have to cut my losses.
624	B: no, thanks.
625	A: you're very welcome. here is my card, if you need any help.
626	B: that's excellent, thanks for all your help.
627	B: i hope i can practice self-control again.
628	B: of course, you can. wait a moment.
629	A: okay, how about a midnight curfew? and i'll let you know where i am.
630	B: no problem, sir. let me help you.
631	A: and steve is going to look after you until we come back.
632	B: actually, it's the dish recommended by this restaurant specially.
633	A: my advice would be to finish it at once.
634	A: oh, no. i am quite a stone in the water and cannot swim.
635	B: serves you right.
636	B: my favorite recreation is cooking. i learned to cook chinese dishes and western style dishes as well. it keeps me busy and makes me happy.
637	A: it will be a long story. we have many differences, for example, she usually puts all her clothes into washing machine. that is the sort of thing i can not bear.
638	B: thank you. you save me.
639	B: now have you ever thought of going by express bus?
640	B: yes, that's possible.
641	A: ok. bye!
642	B: here's your receipt. have a nice day.
643	B: yes, thank you for bringing the wine. it really complements the meal.
644	A: and also tell me how to use other switches.
645	B: i think so. i see it by the radio this morning.
646	A: of course. you have to fill out the form first.
647	A: yes ... quite pretty.
648	B: i think i am. i left the job only because it was too far from my home.
649	B: good.
650	B: it' s me, mum, i am sorry.
651	A: thank you, sir. enjoy your stay with us.
652	B: thank you.
653	B: very well, thanks.
654	A: lin is a common chinese last name.
655	B: you see, because we are often busy working, we eat too much fast food, and that food is very fattening.
656	B: your doctor will be contacting you with the results.
657	B: amazing! i can imagine the feeling when i hear the smooth tune around my ears.
658	A: it's worth a shot.
659	B: oh. i am not his fan.
660	B: keep your fingers crossed. he may pop the question one of these days.
661	A: yes, it's a good habit to have a life-long hobby. those who practise calligraphy and qigong always live longer.
662	B: that's all right.
663	A: bye.
664	B: take my word for it.
665	B: i hope so.
666	B: i appreciate you bringing the wine. it goes well with the chicken.
667	A: wonderful.
668	B: oh, i see. i think 90 days is more than enough time.
669	A: thanks, jeanine, you are a real pal. let's go in.
670	B: are you trying to change our eating patterns?
671	A: no, i was born in gaoxiong, i only moved to taipei after i graduated.
672	B: sounds like fun. you can count me in! just give me directions to the restaurant.
673	B: thank you. here you go.
674	B: sounds good.
675	B: that' s more than my round-trip ticket!
676	A: i think they will.
677	B: a copy or the original? i guess you need the original, right? ok, i'll return shortly.
678	B: yes, it is, but not as hot as in beijing.
679	B: maybe you two should go see a marriage counselor.
680	B: don't worry. we won't be the first.
681	B: she might do well. everyone seems to like her.
682	A: so beat the cat, but don't kill it.
683	A: it's a secret.
684	B: well, that's life.
685	B: yes, it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty-five thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand
686	B: he is more nice than wise.
687	B: that's good.
688	B: it's exaggerated. actually this sort of thing happens to everyone.
689	A: all right.
690	B: ok, it' s better to be far away from him.
691	A: this apartment is nice, but i'd like to find a cheaper one.
692	A: i don't know. my friend told me it was a touching movie.
693	A: it is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of ' comfortable '
694	B: bye!
695	A: settle down, elvin. if you're not careful, you'll give our plan away. zina's smart, you know.
696	A: bye!
697	A: okay.
698	B: great! thank you very much.
699	A: that's expensive.
700	B: yeah, it was scary but exhilarating.
701	B: if i were you, i'd buy.
702	B: ok. i understand. thank you.
703	B: you've got it, sir.
704	B: no. what happened?
705	B: it doesn't matter.
706	B: it's a pleasure.
707	A: no problem, sir. we'll manage it.
708	B: because you are my dear wife.
709	A: let me have a try.
710	B: ok, but make sure that everything is back by sunday night at the latest.
711	A: ok. i never forget it.
712	A: good idea.
713	B: absolutely! if you come to our class, i am sure you will like him.
714	B: really? i'm surprised. i didn't know his english was that good.
715	B: ok, i will take the tour.
716	B: i really appreciate it. thank you.
717	B: all right
718	B: as long as i don' t have to row.
719	B: great! i must warn you though, whatever happens, don' t let me go on a drinking binge. trust me, it' s not a pretty picture!
720	B: my goodness, i didn't realize it was that bad.
721	B: that' s very nice of you to offer. here' s your tea. be careful, it' s still quite hot.
722	B: red.
723	B: thanks!
724	B: ho, no!
725	B: thank you.
726	B: yes, you'll be in a different world there.
727	B: okay.
728	B: here you are. thank you.
729	A: yes.
730	B: yes. he carries a lot of weight. everyone here is willing to follow his orders.
731	A: thanks. yes ... that's all in order. what we will do now is send the l/c amendment to the negotiating bank. as soon as we know anything, we'll contact you.
732	B: fine. if you do end up going somewhere, we can just use our pass key.
733	B: yes, but i don't mind working hard.
734	B: yes. but if i have any more soup, i think i'll die.
735	B: yes.
736	B: call the police.
737	A: no, but she gave me her friend's telephone number. i can call him and make an appointment.
738	B: gosh, you're right! it's from some guy named vic. i wonder who he is ...
739	B: sure. but more importantly, i can have peace of mind.
740	B: ok, one with the apple pie pays $ 18 and the other $ 12.
741	A: just a moment, pls. i'll write out a receipt for you.
742	B: thanks doc, bye!
743	A: here is the fare and keep the change please.
744	A: a $ 100,000 policy shouldn' t be too expensive. here, call my agent. he' ll give you a good deal.
745	B: maybe there's something wrong with her.
746	B: i'm going to refund your money right now.
747	B: also some traditional chinese food, like noodles and dumpling are marketed in modern ways with improved food quality. i heard this year, the government has imposed very stringent inspection on the hi-gene conditions restaurants and suppliers of food are also under tighter control. for sure all the customers will benefit from this.
748	B: you' re right. everything is probably going to come to a head tonight. i' ll keep you informed.
749	A: i'll say.
750	B: well, my pants are very slimming. they're capris.
751	B: well, i just think he deserves it.
752	A: okay, here you are.
753	A: it's already credited to your account.
754	A: that sounds like fun!
755	B: no problem at all. welcome.
756	B: could you come back later? we' re right in the middle of dinner.
757	B: wonderful. i' m so excited.
758	B: fine, i'll go do that for you.
759	B: yes, it will print immediately.
760	A: sure.
761	B: thanks doctor. i' ll get these immediately. goodbye.
762	A: thank you. i think i like playing it.
763	A: oh, i see.
764	B: my boss promised to pay me double time.
765	B: the most you will experience will be a dry cough but you probably won' t experience anything negative.
766	A: definitely. just hope jenny can recover from the pain of divorce soon.
767	A: at 8 o'clock.
768	B: i'll stay at home and have a complete rest.
769	B: it's all or nothing.
770	A: dude, don' t equivocate. a theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. you slept through class, didn' t you?
771	B: certainly, ms. ransom. do you have an order number?
772	B: he's over sixty.
773	A: okay, let's sit over there.
774	A: right. the city life has made us tired and out of energy, while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings.
775	B: yes, very.
776	A: right.
777	B: well, i think you should come and have some fun. besides you never know maybe he likes you as well. you should at least try.
778	B: yeah. two-toned, white and yellow.
779	B: oh, that's where i'm going.
780	B: it depends. so you must be careful buying second-hand goods.
781	A: yes, and i check all the e-mails for mr. thomas.
782	A: fair enough.keep up the good work.
783	B: i'm sure of what i'm doing.
784	A: nothing serious. the right one needs some air.
785	A: oh, you shouldn't. but thank you very much.
786	B: very well. that can be arranged.
787	B: i like almost all sports, and i enjoy both playing and watching. i especially like tennis and mountain climbing. i was in the climbing club all through school.
788	B: lunch sounds great! let's head on out!
789	B: it's a pleasure. good night. have a good sleep.
790	A: it doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal on this price.
791	A: i guess we could also put out a few advertisements for our website inside of the search engine. i would like to find the most effective way to let people know about our site and our products.
792	A: good. now, you sign here, you can start work the beginning of next month.
793	A: i know what you mean, but i'd better remind them again, and also remind them to repair the button in the elevator for the disabled people. that has brought the disabled people lots of inconvenience.
794	A: my shopping life will be more convenient.
795	A: well, i would like a glass of warm water.
796	B: i' m very sorry, madam. can you tell me what the problem is over the phone or would you like me to go to your office?
797	B: great. good work.
798	B: i have all of that with me. i've also banked here for a number of years.
799	B: all right, all right. i am ready to go. let's go!
800	A: but many rich guys don' t think they are truly happy. there is always some empty feeling deep inside them.
801	B: it's fine. i was heading there anyway.
802	A: oh dear. well, get well soon and try to be more careful in future.
803	B: yes, that's right. you have a good memory.
804	B: time is flying. i still remember everything when he was a child.
805	A: that' s a great idea. i' ll search for some information on the internet. if it' s possible to do, the internet will have some information about it.
806	B: good.
807	B: las vegas is in the southwest.
808	B: our monthly interest is 1.5% of the outstanding balance. would you please fill out this application form?
809	B: i'd hate for you to think i was lazy in returning your money.
810	B: hope so.
811	B: good. that' s something unusual.
812	A: well, please give me a first class ticket.
813	B: akha.
814	A: and your statement reference and the payment amount. click on next, then ' pay beneficiaries '. that's it! all done.
815	B: i know how you feel. i had a similar problem with a landlord a few years ago. fortunately, the one we have now is very nice.
816	B: i'd be glad to.
817	B: no. you see, i went back to school to get my master' s degree when i was in my thirties. you won' t be older than that.
818	B: nothing much.
819	A: now, i am responsible for training new staff, but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods. i know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove. but i don' t like your way.
820	B: one of the questions they ask you is if you were well enough to work.
821	B: it gets better on sunday, though. the storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night. it will still be rather cool, with highs in the low 50s. the west coast will be experiencing some
822	A: there is a maple leaf on the flag.
823	B: not at all. i see you and your family twice a week, and i enjoy seeing my own friends. i' m too busy to feel lonely!
824	A: don't worry. bye.
825	B: let me know with your next dance. i know a band that may give you a break for the publicity.
826	B: ok. let' s go!
827	B: see you later.
828	B: i think mary must be sad, because she loves her husband very much.
829	B: okay.
830	B: leave me! go away!
831	B: ok.
832	A: ok. thank you.
833	B: i apologize. one moment, please, while i transfer you to my supervisor.
834	A: sure, may i have your name and account number please?
835	B: okay. check you later.
836	B: his life is hanging by a thread, and he is under an emergency treatment.
837	B: i forgot what i put up with in that case. i do deserve these flowers.
838	A: ok. i can't wait to see it. let's go!
839	B: wait a minute, i will bring you some juice.
840	B: good! maybe malia would like to go in with us on this gift.
841	B: it's a bit small but looks nice.what ' s more, it's only ten minutes ' walk to the company.
842	B: but i like the feeling.
843	B: you can say that again.
844	B: not really. there are many successful mixed marriage around us.
845	B: yes, and if i stay with you, we will have to walk back home to new york.because we will lose all our money and our plane tickets too!
846	B: we're an employment agency.
847	B: that's good, but i think it's too late. she hasn't studied all semester, and i doubt she can catch up in one week.
848	B: sure ... but it's probably better for the workers, because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys. the only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite. labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog.
849	A: it's no use complaining.if we had got enough money, we wouldn't put up with it!
850	B: because the company is far away from home, and i have to study after work so i can't afford to waste time on the road everyday.
851	A: let me see. what a moving poem!
852	A: it's also convenient, but it's usually crowded.
853	B: they will tell you the aid is impossible.
854	B: ha, ha! those days are long gone.
855	B: i don't know how they function the next day! it's like they eat and breathe soccer!
856	A: if you have any more laundry, please just leave it in the laundry bag behind the bathroom door. the laundryman comes to collect it every morning.
857	A: thanks.
858	B: you are, why not ask for a date?
859	A: it's kind of cool, isn't it? i'm sort of like a secret agent.
860	A: you are quite right.
861	B: i agree with you. only in this way can we ease the traffic problems.
862	B: sorry, sir. the prices here are all fixed.
863	A: i see. we offer agent services free of charge here. before your new business begins trading, we could, on behalf of your existing company, do a series of registration and get the certificates you need. if you are unsure of the local laws, that is.
864	A: it's a pleasure. thanks for calling lincoln bank.
865	B: you can make it by the no. 913 bus, or by subway line 13.
866	A: two copies? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of, right?
867	B: i'll tell you what, i'll go over the number again with our financial team and see what i can do. i can't give you any guarantees. but we can try.
868	B: you may have a little bit of a dry cough, but you will feel much better.
869	A: fine. i'll be expecting you around two.
870	B: it will be up shortly. enjoy your food, sir.
871	A: i do want to send it airmail, yes.
872	A: the car behind ours suddenly accelerated and hit our car.
873	B: i' m afraid not, nick. that' s the best i can do.
874	B: i am sorry.sir.we will send someone immediately.
875	A: that's right. thank you.
876	A: i know it does seem a little daunting, but once you get used to it, it will save you a lot of time and trouble.
877	B: and he's so handsome.
878	B: i work downtown at station 24.it can get a little crazy sometimes but that' s what makes it challenging.
879	B: you flatter me.
880	A: have a nice day, bye!
881	A: yes, i did.
882	B: sure.
883	B: i totally agree!
884	B: see you at seven fifteen, saturday.
885	B: suppose you want to find a book by your professor, william smith. you'd look under smith and then william. since that's very common name, you may have to go through several ' william smith ' until you come to the one who wrote book on the subject you are interested in.
886	B: why do you worry about your future? you're very young, and you'll make great contribution to the world. i hope you take my advice.
887	A: i'll accept your offer.
888	A: she's 42.
889	B: you can wear more clothes.
890	A: poor girl!
891	B: thank you.
892	B: ok, a bottle of the house red please!
893	B: no problem.
894	B: i believe every company has its own salary criterion. and you will give me a satisfying salary according to my abilities and performances.
895	B: you are so kind. thanks.
896	A: cheer up, nada. you'll be fine.
897	A: if it's any good, i'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition.
898	B: no, but those guys like to hit on me.
899	B: i sure will.
900	A: yes. this is a duty-free shop.
901	A: no, the meeting will be held on the fourth floor.
902	B: i had to visit all my relatives.
903	A: three months? incredible!
904	A: i will, thank you for calling.
905	B: yes, i have. i collect stamps, chinese stamps as well as those from other countries.
906	B: no problem.
907	B: oh? i heard she dumped you. anyway, she's right over there. oh, sheryl!
908	A: thank you.
909	B: i hope i will meet her soon.
910	B: that' s what i can do.
911	B: absolutely. take my word for it.
912	A: oh, sure.
913	A: yes, that's a current-all-in-one passbook. that's what you need to get your salary.
914	A: oh, i'm not certain, but i think i've lost it.
915	B: maybe you should ask him openly.
916	B: i thought they had already agreed to everything. that' s going to take weeks to rework.
917	B: you need to be interviewed over the phone. they will set up a time for you.
918	B: i see. you must have more rest.
919	B: not a bit.
920	A: oh, no problem.
921	B: i don' t mind if you want to.
922	B: not at all.
923	A: no kidding. we've got to come up with two completely different sales pitches to suit the needs of each groups.
924	B: i' ll see you then. good bye.
925	A: ok.
926	B: that's alright. here you are.
927	A: just remember to hold on to your ticket. you need it to get out of the station when you get there.
928	B: it is so encouraging to hear this remark. the secret is to make plans. write down your goals, short-term and long-term and make detail plans for a week or a month. then just work hard.
929	B: i support our new president 100%.
930	B: great idea!
931	B: bye.
932	B: we both may be snakes, dave, but i'm just better at it. among the snakes, i'm the sneakiest.
933	B: don't mention it.
934	B: thanks, i appreciate that!
935	B: you're welcome.
936	A: see you.
937	B: got it. thank you, shirley.
938	A: i can't, either. i like watching.
939	A: thank you for your interview with me.
940	B: i hope you find a nice sweater.
941	A: ok, i will.
942	A: terrific! b. a ., again and again-b. a.

946	A: fine too.
947	B: i'll do my best.

949	A: you're welcome.
950	B: the taxi will be ready when you are, sir.
951	B: absolutely. take my word for it.
952	A: i can imagine! i tend to faint when i see blood, so i think i won' t be taking up a course like that anytime soon!
953	B: sure.but you need to be patient.
954	B: oh, yeah. i' m there!
955	B: oh, yes. i' d love to.
956	A: that's fine. all you need to do is fill in this form and state the amendment.
957	B: thanks a lot.
958	B: so, that's everything done for you. here's your new cheque book, the cheque guarantee will follow in the post in a couple of days.
959	B: all right, but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon? we're very busy just now as you can see, sir.
960	B: i wish i could tell you yes, but no, there isn't.
961	B: ok, but don't forget i'm here for you, and i know how you feel. it's my loss, too.
962	B: yeah, sounds like something i should definitely do.
963	B: focus on being relaxed and open, don't forget to smile and shake hands and be genuinely interested in what their company is about. i'm sure you'll do well.
964	A: ok, sir. we will arrange it for you.
965	A: i think i will.
966	B: oh, my shoes pinch me. let's find a seat and sit a while.
967	B: oh, in that case, sure! uh ... what are these long sock-looking things?
968	A: then you haven't browsed ebay before ... get online. don't hang up!

970	A: thank you. bye.
971	A: is six o' clock okay?
972	B: ok, i'd like to purchase 500 us dollars worth of traveller's cheques, please.
973	B: let's ask someone else.
974	B: no problem, just get rid of the bugs!
975	A: yes, actually, the song has been sung since its publication in 1932.people all over the world have sung it in many different languages.
976	B: more often than not, the understatement is ' i'm afraid it's time you leave '.
977	B: certainly, just a moment, sir.
978	B: no wonder you say english is a crazy language.
979	B: thank you very much. bye-bye.
980	A: certainly.please sign your name here.
981	A: enjoy your drink, sir.
982	B: yeah, sometimes.

1000	B: wow, you are going to be busy this semester! okay, here you go. you are registered now, you' ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.
1001	A: not at all. welcome again.
1002	B: they caught him before he could walk through the front door.
1003	A: i think you're right. there needs to be an international response to this problem?
1004	A: no dissert, thanks, just coffee.can i have the check please?
1005	B: i would like to have a job that is more lively than my present one. besides, i would like to practise my english in my work. as my present employer deals with china trade towards china only, there isn' t much chance to speak english.
1006	A: oh, lots of things. mostly training new people.
1007	B: i failed in my computer course once and i made up my mind to learn it well. then i made painstaking preparation for 3 months and i finally got it.
1008	B: well, it can't be helped. we'll just have to put up with it.
1009	A: i' ll try the vegetarian, please.
1010	A: i also have a doubt. oh, kill me softly, she is may.
1011	B: no! i am on my way to the reserve room. thanks again!
1012	A: oh, so it was my fault, was it? if i hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse.
1013	A: that about does it. see you in a week.
1014	B: it takes some time for the stuff you buy online to arrive. but i think this problem will be solved soon.
1015	B: don' t get your hopes up.
1016	B: he'll be right with you.
1017	B: ok. i'll take one.
1018	B: here you go. look in this flyer, or check with the produce person.

1020	B: i'll enjoy working with you. have a great day!
1021	B: no, but i have database programming experience and network knowledge.
1022	A: i' m relieved to hear that. anyway, it' s my fault.
1023	B: all right, but let me know your decision before the end of the day.
1024	B: i know. but i couldn' t help.
1025	A: no problem.
1026	A: good-bye.
1027	B: thank you. i just consider working as part of my life.
1028	B: well, actually it' s just about luck.
1029	A: trust me, regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs.
1030	B: i haven't thought of that.
1031	A: thank you.
1032	B: all right. why don' t you have a seat? what' s the problem?
1033	B: i will. thanks for telling me.
1034	B: see you.
1035	A: you are flattering me.
1036	B: but you're also going to have to give some attention to trade restrictions. you can get much information about environment of investment.
1037	A: maybe. i will look around.
1038	B: i hope so.
1039	B: oh, very easy. they are heart, spade, club and diamond.
1040	A: i see.thank you.
1041	A: 9: oo. don't worry, miss, we have buses every 15 minutes.
1042	B: no, don' t bother. it' s all right as it is.
1043	A: but swimming in the winter is good for your body. believe me.
1044	B: that will be fine. and i can promise you that you'll get the goods about two weeks after we get your purchase order.
1045	A: really? i' ll take it then.
1046	B: everyone has a one-week waiting period before they can collect.
1047	B: thank you.
1048	B: we always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible.
1049	B: wow! you're right! this refrigerator is great. i'll take it.
1050	A: goodbye, randy. take care.
1051	B: she' s my friend' s ten-year-old niece. i guess there won' t be another wedding in this family for a long time.
1052	B: great! i can't wait.
1053	A: bye bye.
1054	B: that' s a good idea. i' ll look into finding something like that.
1055	B: yes, he described her to me, and she sounded like my type.
1056	B: no, thanks. that will be all.
1057	A: his family will be pleased to hear that. they must have been so worried.
1058	B: fine, mr. tan. i' ll see you then.
1059	A: david, stop dreaming. it' s time to do your homework.
1060	B: did i? let me see that ... oh, sorry ... here you are.
1061	A: it's ok now. don't worry, john.
1062	B: neither can i.
1063	B: yeah, let me have a try.
1064	B: oh, that sounds great. how about 6 o' clock?
1065	B: i think dimes and quarters will do.
1066	B: the only thing you should do now is relax. you already are pre-qualified for your loan.
1067	B: good that way. i can have the suit ready for you two days after that fitting.
1068	B: yes, i couldn't agree with you more. a 1 year time deposit it is!
1069	B: on friday.
1070	A: that's reasonable. ok, thank you very much.
1071	A: thank you. i appreciate your help.
1072	A: i' ll look for a ticket for you, too.
1073	B: well, the check out time is 12:00 o'clock everyday, if you checked out after 15:00, we have to charge you for another day.
1074	B: oh, jack! that's wonderful!
1075	B: needless to say, as a westerner, it's bread.
1076	B: we will check with the parties concerned right away.
1077	B: thank you. that' s perfect timing.
1078	B: i hope i will meet her soon.
1079	B: in other words, too much emphasis on it is undoubtedly to neglect the essentials.
1080	A: thanks a billion.
1081	A: pretty well, i think.
1082	A: i hope you will make us your best offer, cif new york.
1083	A: umm. i think i' ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business!
1084	A: well, i think you prepare it well and capture good savings, retiring early can give you a lot more time for travel and other activities, you should get out and enjoy the life you still can't, don't you think?
1085	B: i' m on it!
1086	A: yes, they are different because they are printed by the ministry of finance in set amounts. just 100 rib, 500 rib and 1,000 rib, you cannot choose from many amounts, you see.
1087	B: yes, everything will be cleared.
1088	A: oh, sure. credit card is fine.
1089	B: i'm more than happy having her in my class.
1090	B: well, he is a hard case. everyone would feel headache about him.
1091	B: oh, that' s too bad.
1092	B: ii is distinguished for the strength of law and foreign languages studies ..
1093	A: wait a moment. and you can check where other sales are.
1094	B: i think i know that.
1095	B: that's very nice of you.
1096	A: sure. here you are.attach the label to your luggage and put your bag here.
1097	B: oh, really? i go to the gym every day.
1098	B: let's go ask about it.
1099	B: good for you. no problem, i'll listen to the car radio
1100	B: another big step forward in saving on our office equipment, i don' t need a desktop anymore. a laptop is enough.
1101	B: yes, that would make a good ending for your resume.
1102	A: i admire your energy, ruth. you are young at heart.
1103	B: sure thing. i've got time.
1104	B: then you'll need small change.
1105	B: if sounds so tempting. why not go applying for a loan from the bank? they charge very low interest, so you can choose whether to pay up the balance in 10 or 20 years.
1106	B: my feelings are mixed on the issue too. by helping you i' m losing a valuable and trusted employee. however i think you are taking a step in the right direction.
1107	B: you're in luck. we still have that little table.
1108	A: in our company, the loborial force makes up 60% of our workers. we'd just be letting slightly over half the folks out a little early.
1109	B: i think this suits me. can i try it on?
1110	B: and please shut the door and lock it behind you!
1111	A: that' s human nature.
1112	B: you' re a part of history.
1113	B: jingshan park is especially a popular place for old people socializing and gathering. people can often find elder folks dancing, singing opera and other cultural activities at jingshan park.
1114	B: thank you so much.
1115	A: the fragrance of plum blossoms comes from the hard coldness.
1116	B: great!
1117	B: don' t count on it.
1118	B: well. you should be able to give me some advice on where to stay. at the moment, i am staying in a hotel which is far away from the school.
1119	B: good idea. let's ask the officer for help.
1120	B: you are welcome.
1121	B: nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question, you know.
1122	B: i see.you ' re a stranger here.walk two blocks ahead, then turn left. you can't miss it.
1123	B: fine. i'll be ready in a minute.
1124	A: no problem.
1125	B: i think so.thank you.
1126	A: after the meals. and do not forget to take two sleeping pills before going to bed.
1127	A: i know, but you deserve it.
1128	B: you think so? let' s take a chance!
1129	B: what a pity!
1130	B: yeah! where there is a will, there is a way.
1131	A: thanks a lot.
1132	A: are you crazy? you were cheating.
1133	B: ok, let's go.
1134	B: yeah, and we can get to know each other at the party.
1135	A: ok. i can't wait to see it. let's go!
1136	A: ok. i hope you will be in touch with me shortly.
1137	B: you should take several resumes and some copies of your graduate diploma.
1138	B: no problem!
1139	A: yes, we've got all the necessary equipment. we can give the engines a major overhaul. if there's a serious problem, we strip down the engine and find the faulty component. would you like to look around?
1140	A: you're very welcome. here is my card, if you need any help.
1141	A: it certainly was! so, what are you going to do with your windfall?
1142	B: that would be good.
1143	B: i really appreciate that.
1144	B: whatever, i' m going next door i heard mrs. robinson is giving out big bags of m&ms!
1145	A: i'm afraid we don't. but i'm sure you'll enjoy our lunch special.
1146	B: hmm, they're not too bad.
1147	B: i wish you the best of luck.
1148	A: i've told you i'm an expert.
1149	B: thanks for your praise, madam.
1150	A: all right. that nearly done a little.now i want you to look some pictures.
1151	A: let's run up and give him a hand.
1152	A: here you are, sir. pay the cashier at the door.
1153	B: sure. why don' t you sit down for a minute? you haven' t taken a rest all morning.
1154	A: fine, i want to book one for overnight.
1155	B: don't you see i'm trying my best?
1156	B: return, please.
1157	A: well. don't forget to perform your duty next time, ok? now, let's start our lesson.
1158	B: i forgot what i put up with. in that case, i do deserve these flowers.
1159	A: you must tell your embassy about it. and i think they' ll issue you with a new one.
1160	A: bingo!
1161	A: well, that's too expensive. i can't afford that.
1162	B: it's my pleasure!
1163	B: that sounds fine. i'll be there around seven.
1164	B: no problem.
1165	B: thank you.
1166	A: oops!
1167	B: impossible!
1168	B: because i don' t think my husband would like it. thank you for inviting me anyway.
1169	B: you can take no. 2 bus.
1170	A: i guess working with so much money has made me rather greedy. maybe losing my job would be a good thing!
1171	B: it' s wonderful, isn' t it? would you like to see some photos that i look recently?
1172	B: you cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling. now excuse me, i have a protest rally to organize!
1173	A: you are supposed to check in at least one hour beforehand.
1174	A: sounds like it was ment to be.
1175	B: now you're talking, we can see that love story next time.
1176	B: i' m afraid i' ll be late.
1177	A: great! many thanks!
1178	A: you should have kept trying.
1179	B: i've never seen anything like it.
1180	B: i have to say your education and experience are very outstanding, but it seems that you are not good at working in a team which we attach great importance to.
1181	A: thank you.
1182	B: see you then.
1183	B: thank you.
1184	B: uh huh, that's for sure. you might find that your only career choice is teaching other graduate students.
1185	B: at the drop of a hat.
1186	B: i liked talking to you too.
1187	B: okay, sir. sleep well.
1188	B: it's very nice of you.
1189	B: ok. let me try.
1190	A: it's m, c, capital d.
1191	A: you got it. well, he walked up to me and said my name again and then i realized it was the boy i had been thinking about, the one from third grade!
1192	A: you can rest assured that we won't disturb others anymore.
1193	A: susan has already given me a list of all the stationery which we need to buy.
1194	B: it's for you.
1195	B: let me run and check.
1196	A: yeah. i got to eat as much pizza as i could for free.
1197	B: that's perfect. i will definitely do well.
1198	B: i don't mind the work. i think it's worthwhile.
1199	B: great. i will prepare some clothes and food for the climbing.
1200	B: we're going to that new restaurant for lunch. would you like to join us?
1201	B: i'm afraid there isn't.
1202	B: you're welcome.
1203	B: that sounds great. i'll bring a bottle of wine then.
1204	A: you are unfair to her. she is a very nice girl.
1205	A: 5 days. from feb. 13 to 18.
1206	B: i'm sure he'll love the idea. just throw yourself into it and you'll enjoy it!
1207	A: i think there's someone at the door. excuse me while i go and get that.
1208	B: i hope we don't have any more blackouts.
1209	B: i usually meet some friends and we play sports together or i might spend some time alone on my hobbies. i spend winter evening watching tv, but i spend summer evening at cultural events if i have time.
1210	B: yeah, it' s me. can you give me a lift after work?
1211	B: well, ok. you are always right.
1212	B: ok. here are your robes. you can go shower first.
1213	B: you' re welcome.
1214	B: oh. it's too late. maybe i should go to other video stores to have a look.
1215	B: i am glad i did not drive a car.
1216	B: ok.
1217	A: the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used. russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest.
1218	B: it'll be fine.
1219	B: make it three cups. here comes harry.
1220	B: ok, i'll go to your office at that time.
1221	B: thank you so much. i'll find the nearest branch and come in tomorrow. thanks again for all of your help.
1222	B: i' ll do that soon.
1223	A: it' s all so interesting. i' ll have to find more information about it on the internet. or perhaps i should try and attend your geography class.
1224	B: thanks for telling me.
1225	A: thanks!
1226	A: woo, that's quite convenient.
1227	B: it is because your children have grown up, and you haven' t lived with a child for a long time.
1228	B: thank you. you're very kind.
1229	B: good idea. i will take the racket.
1230	B: in that case, i'm fit for the position i think.
1231	B: it' s going to cost you $ 25.
1232	B: yeah, i am of the same opinion.
1233	A: i will. it's most thoughtful of you.
1234	A: fine today, though a bit under the weather last week.
1235	B: i'll get all of that for you right away. someone should be up shortly
1236	A: thank you.
1237	A: no, i'd definitely try to restore it to its original state. i love to imagine what it'd be like to live in another time in history and living in a house decorated like it would have been 200 years ago would be a great way to feed my imagination even more!
1238	B: by all means. (of course.)
1239	B: i'll give you something. i want you to take it easy and come back in a couple of days.
1240	B: yes, sir.go ahead.here you are.
1241	A: no.
1242	A: you're welcome. i hope all of you will have a good time here.
1243	B: more and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort.
1244	B: i'd love to, but i'm broke. maybe after payday.
1245	A: my pleasure.
1246	B: ok.take care.
1247	B: alright, i'll get it.
1248	A: have a good time!
1249	B: that is fine.
1250	B: i can think of two things made of paper â stationery and money.
1251	B: i'll charge it. here's my card.
1252	B: there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will, but i don't think it's going to happen any time soon.
1253	A: wait a second! there's the idea for this case! "your motor oil should be as choice and fresh as your morning coffee ."
1254	B: $ 2.
1255	B: thank you so much.
1256	A: one moment and i'll check.
1257	A: i don't know about that, but my door is always open. stop by anytime.
1258	B: here it is. four pounds and fifty pence in all.
1259	B: at a formal dinner, you wait for your hostess to put hers on her lap first.
1260	B: maybe people don' t like to have friends that are all the same. most people like a little variety in their lives-including a variety of characteristics in their friends.
1261	B: suit yourself. don' t forget to set the alarm clock.
1262	A: ok, thank you.
1263	A: i think i'm your lucky fellow.
1264	B: noirin, n-o-i-r-i-n, it's an irish name.
1265	A: bye.
1266	A: thank you!
1267	B: maybe we can make reservations ahead of time?
1268	A: never mind, dear.
1269	A: i appreciate that.
1270	B: the ending is a bit weak. it's so abrupt, like those of most other detective stories.
1271	A: thanks.
1272	A: thank you very much.
1273	A: but he has to stick to it and to it long enough.
1274	A: yeah, sure, you won't be disappointed.
1275	A: i have trouble understanding all these forms ... but i'm sure i'll get it.
1276	B: possibly.
1277	A: single please.
1278	B: hmm, that' s a tough question. but i would have to say my passion. i' m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.
1279	B: poor old john! i am ever so sorry.
1280	B: over 2 million.
1281	B: you mean, you like the pictures of the beautiful models ... hello?
1282	B: i'll see you later then. have a great day!
1283	B: who's calling?
1284	A: i will. many thanks, mr.black.
1285	A: thank you, here's your change.
1286	A: sounds good! let's go!
1287	A: yes, great!
1288	B: partly, and he's also a hardworking man.
1289	B: i'm sorry to hear that.
1290	B: oh, you've already grown up, son.
1291	A: i know! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.
1292	A: yes, let's go.
1293	A: i never took that yet. if that was your favorite, i think i will check it out.
1294	B: that's better.
1295	A: sure, my name is ana ferris. don' t worry about it. it happens to me all the time. i' m terrible with names too.
1296	A: thanks for reminding me. she's the right person to help me.
1297	B: yes. he always get us special gift. we should repay his kindness.
1298	B: give him a chance.
1299	A: see you!
1300	B: no. go to bed right now.
1301	B: i' ve been to other scandinavian countries, but not to norway. perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there.
1302	A: i hope it' ll continue for a long time.
1303	A: i'm so familiar with her songs, but i don't know what kind of person she is in real life.
1304	B: in a few months i'm planning to invest my money into some foreign companies. i think you need to reevaluate your spending habits.
1305	A: you're right. thank you for the advice.
1306	B: and then you just pour the batter into the waffle iron ...
1307	B: ok. here you are.
1308	A: it' s an anniversary of our weeding.
1309	A: oh, my chance is slim then.
1310	B: it all depends on what you want to accomplish in your life.
1311	B: absolutely. that set it off big time!
1312	B: mr. ted, i have to apologize for that and i assure you it won't happy again.
1313	B: i' m excited that barack obama is our president.
1314	B: really? i have a weakness for coffee.
1315	B: yes, we bought veal sandwiches. we stopped around twelve, and we ate and watched the squirrels, but it was too windy to sit long. it was a very nice walk, anyway.
1316	B: thank you.
1317	A: it's a deal!
1318	B: hmm, i must be getting absent-minded.
1319	B: aright. see you there.
1320	B: sorry, my english isn' t so good. could you speak a little slower?
1321	A: have you got the number? i'll call them right now.
1322	A: you can bring life photos, recommendation letters and certificates.
1323	B: ok! i' ll bring one to you next time.
1324	B: no, i feel young, fresh and energetic.
1325	B: mmmm, sounds like risky business. good luck.
1326	B: perfect. so, i guess my next job is to go to the newsagent and buy some car magazines. thanks for everything.
1327	A: brooke!
1328	A: of course, you can.
1329	A: certainly.
1330	B: congratulations! i' m really glad to hear it! that should make balancing the books a lot easier!
1331	B: thanks for the vote of confidence, justin!
1332	B: what you said gives me the creeps!
1333	B: well, the only thing you can do is pay the fee to recover your service.
1334	B: i think so, too.
1335	A: loretta? no, she can't come, she's busy.
1336	B: yes. we had a big talk with him, and he has really turned over a new leaf.
1337	B: okay, i will.
1338	A: ok, i see
1339	B: all right.
1340	B: it's reasonable. here you are.
1341	B: i want to make more contact with extra clients and use my organizational skills in the future.
1342	B: thank you.
1343	B: i think tv is a great waste of time, so i would only have one small tv in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning.
1344	B: when i was your age, my parents didn' t have central heating like you do! we had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it. we used it to cook, heat the house and even dry our clothes! we never caught a cold. you should be grateful!
1345	B: oh, thank god. thank you, i'll be right back.
1346	B: thanks.
1347	B: because if you drink a kind of tea which has been prepared for some time before, it will do you harm.
1348	B: hmm, that' s a tough question. but i would have to say my passion. i' m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.
1349	B: oh, it's a pity.
1350	A: you really have a big head, don't you.
1351	B: yes, we' ll do so.
1352	A: cash, please.
1353	B: my watch stopped and i didn't know. i certainly need to buy a better one.
1354	B: yes, i'd like a large soda, please.
1355	A: please fill in this exchange form, and i'll need to see your passport, and sign here. that's the money and your passport back. of course, if you don't spend all of it, you can come back and we'd be happy to buy the local currency back from you.
1356	B: i know what you are talking about. the performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired. there is no surprise during the actual review.
1357	A: you're welcome. goodbye.
1358	A: oh, i've heard a lot about the chinese herbal medicine. i believe it will work.
1359	A: yes, please do that.
1360	B: frankly, some part of it i enjoy very much, but i prefer something more professional. it happens that i have a friend working here in this company. she told me the export department was to recruit an assistant. i felt very excited at this news. that's why i'm here.
1361	B: yes, hope you can enjoy it.
1362	A: two bottles of white wine, please.
1363	B: yes, i really don't like it.
1364	B: i like indian food as well.
1365	A: there's some professionals for both flower arrangement and tea ceremony. so you need to go to a school, yes, and learn from your teacher and their hierarchy and the organization and you need to pass each test to go, climb up the ladder in the hierarchy.
1366	B: thanks!
1367	B: yes, i did.
1368	B: no.that ' s all.
1369	A: i only watch now.
1370	A: let's write it at once.
1371	B: not at all.
1372	A: maybe he's abnormal.
1373	A: fund info, the fund code, fund net value per unit, fund public info, fund account balance, fund trading conformation, daily details and the history. with our net banking, anything is possible!
1374	A: who is afraid? i am not afraid.
1375	B: thanks, ma'am.
1376	B: i can't wait to play in the water. my feet are burning when i stand on the sand.
1377	B: absolutely! bob and his whole family are welcome here any time!
1378	B: oh, that' s right. is that time of the year, huh? that' s fine. how about if we meet at 3:30 this afternoon?
1379	B: i promise you'll have it tomorrow.
1380	A: i'd better not. brooke hates the backstreet boys!
1381	B: you are so interesting.
1382	B: i think i am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you. here, feel how hot my head is!
1383	B: yes, you are right. either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly, but they can enter into an agreement. in such case, each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible.
1384	A: great. you can move in next monday. your first month's rent is due then.
1385	A: oh, i see.
1386	B: thank you.
1387	B: i' m sorry, melissa. i really can' t today. i' ve just got too much going on. maybe tomorrow.
1388	A: we will lodge at the indigenes ' houses. it's interesting.
1389	B: you're right.
1390	B: yeah, why not? i' ve got a little free time on my hands. where do you want to eat?
1391	B: thanks doc, bye!
1392	A: thanks a lot.
1393	A: it's a deal.
1394	B: oh, sure. i'll be back in a minute.
1395	B: because he stayed with me all the time that night.
1396	B: yeah, it' s fair to say so.
1397	A: no, thank you! i want an apartment, not a prison.
1398	A: 30 yuan.
1399	A: thanks, i appreciated it.
1400	B: she said that she didn' t want to foul her own nest.
1401	B: all right. i will take a room for a week. here is my passport.
1402	B: if i am not in the service center, i will assist others in resolving the consumer complaints. and pass the criticism on to the relevant department.
1403	A: so you get drunk every day?
1404	A: a moment, please.
1405	A: don't worry. i'll help you with it later.
1406	B: that's fine. quickly please, we are so hungry.
1407	B: birds of a feather flock together.
1408	A: i have to find something.otherwise i have to go back to taiwan. i'll be broke in two months.
1409	B: oh, he's the coach of the football team.
1410	B: i'll catch you later then. have a wonderful morning.
1411	A: yes.
1412	B: 3 days.
1413	B: we're not turning on the heater in may! you need to take a bath. we'll heat you up and see if you can sweat this thing out.
1414	B: and we' ll all help you.
1415	B: what? you call that a stir fry? more meat than vegetables? that' s the worst insult you could throw at a chinese stir fry. what a disgrace to the wok she fried it in! what you had is equivalent to a fajita without the wrap!
1416	A: don't worry about it.
1417	B: thanks a lot. i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon, too. you' ve been doing some great work!
1418	B: i' m glad you finally agree.
1419	B: let's see what else is on first.
1420	A: it's august the thirteenth.
1421	B: i'll be right back. i just need to mail this package.
1422	B: it was really an exciting moment.
1423	A: cheer up! don't let me down. we all make mistakes, and that is life.
1424	A: she's a late riser.
1425	B: i graduated and now want to get a ba.
1426	B: see you.
1427	B: they should be there in the next hour.
1428	B: i will start my work at the beginning of next month.
1429	A: fine, we'll do that.
1430	B: awesome. you'll see that they are really catchy.
1431	A: now it's my son's turn to wait.
1432	A: take a look at this dress! don't you think it's perfect for you, ma'am? uh, where are you going, ma'am? ma'am?
1433	B: no, thank you.
1434	B: thanks.
1435	B: i am a journalist. i write for china daily.
1436	B: thank you very much.
1437	A: there are plenty of rugby fans in my country too.
1438	B: sure. i will.
1439	B: don't mention it.
1440	B: poor old john! i am ever so sorry.
1441	B: that's for sure. i feel like i'm melting.
1442	B: that sounds great. i'll take them.
1443	A: yeah, but i wish they delivered video games too. then i would never leave my house!
1444	A: twenty yuan.
1445	A: goodbye.
1446	A: first class, sir.
1447	B: i was really sad too, but at least i can still listen to their cds.
1448	A: good night, sleep tight; don' t let the bed bugs bite!
1449	B: i will think about it.
1450	B: sure it is. i really hate to get caught in a traffic jam.
1451	A: sorry, i dialed the wrong number.
1452	B: ok. let' go back to the hotdog stand.
1453	A: you' re welcome.
1454	A: ok, thanks!
1455	B: you might lose the file you were working on, but don't worry, the help desk can restore it. when did you last take a backup?
1456	A: you're welcome. i hope you'll be more comfortable in your new room.
1457	A: i' m not going to put this off any longer, casey! i want those photos asap!
1458	A: yes. i suppose it's best to stop.
1459	B: but i am not that someone. i can easily talk him into doing whatever i want him to do.
1460	B: as long as you go vote, that' s all that matters.
1461	A: thanks. i really appreciate it. thanks so much.
1462	B: well, we'll be careful. thanks for letting me know.
1463	B: i can believe that.
1464	B: great â that' ll be big help.
1465	A: see. great minds think alike.
1466	B: not at all.
1467	B: it's too late.
1468	B: me either, but i' m dealing with it anyway.
1469	B: goodbye.
1470	B: it's too difficult to park your car in the city. also, the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare.
1471	B: he's a chicken guy.
1472	A: yes, ten days.
1473	B: you're welcome, glad to be of assistance.
1474	B: no, not at all.it ' s about how to keep fit.
1475	A: that is him.
1476	A: thanks a lot.
1477	A: there are a lot of ways to help a kid build up self-esteem, but to begin with, you can try and give him more rewards. rewards will help a chil improve his self-esteem.
1478	B: i can't bear eating less.
1479	B: oh, really? just a moment ... you paid with a ten-dollar note and i gave you ... oh, sorry, here's a five left. i'm terribly sorry.
1480	B: once in a while.
1481	B: yes. this has been fun.
1482	B: no, he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel.
1483	B: i am really looking forward to getting away from you. far away from you!
1484	A: yes, i did, but i didn' t do very well. i made the final in both events, but came last. at least i made the final. i was very pleased with that.
1485	B: yes, we do, thank you.
1486	B: not particularly. i like a girl to be good.
1487	B: i see. thanks for your drive.
1488	B: anyway, the host team seems to fight for the gold.
1489	A: i' m not too worried about it. i always seem to find something.
1490	B: that's true. but i am sorry i can't make an exception. we have quoted you our lowest price. we can't give you any more discounts.
1491	B: yes, sometimes. i don't like working nights i have problems sleeping during the day.
1492	A: yes, there are. they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk.
1493	A: you can rest assured of that.
1494	B: that sounds fine. if you could give me the name and address of the dealer i'll go over there now and see what they've got.
1495	B: yes, it' s a small world. we never know where we' ll meet someone we know.
1496	B: glad to meet you mr smith my name is jenny.
1497	A: hmm, i' ll pass. hopefully i can find a decent place that won' t cost a fortune.
1498	B: i' ll just have to put up with it.
1499	B: good idea, let's shop to we drop!
1500	B: ha-ha! you got me there!
1501	B: fine, i will begin a search for the perfect home for you. i will call you in a few days.
1502	B: i' d like to bring to abc company not only my technical skills, ambition, enthusiasm, but also my loyalty. a sincere desire to become an administrative assistant is the heart of my career plans.
1503	A: the motorcycle? but that' s mine!
1504	B: i know. are the subway trains easy to take here?
1505	A: sometimes, it' s hard to know who belongs in each section of the museum!
1506	B: there shouldn't be any long lines, sir.
1507	A: that's ok. thanks for your help.
1508	B: thank you very much. i' m looking forward to hearing from you about this job.
1509	A: that's a good idea. i think we will soon come to a solution to the problem.
1510	B: thank you. he' s very lucky indeed.
1511	A: yes. let me help you.
1512	A: that's good. what's the fee?
1513	B: that' s all right. i' ll be finished in a little while.
1514	B: then i guess i'll just get a snickers.
1515	A: i see. thank you.
1516	B: i sure hope so.
1517	A: how do you know that i didn' t try? i just couldn' t manage it.
1518	B: let me see. that' s no problem. i' ll see you then.
1519	B: whatever, i' m going next door i heard mrs. robinson is giving out big bags of m&ms!
1520	B: yes, please.
1521	B: hmm ... i think i am ready for a new challenge. i've put a good team together at my present company, and i think if i want to take the next step in my career, it's time for me to move on.
1522	B: you've got no guts!
1523	A: it depends on the job. it's actually more cost-effective than buying specialist equipment that we don't use very often.
1524	B: i guess you see the value in it, too.
1525	B: he deserved it.
1526	A: sorry. i take that back. i mean the copper buddha you wanted.
1527	B: oh, sorry, sir.we take no tips here.thank you all the same.
1528	A: good idea!
1529	A: sounds like a plan. let's meet in front of tower records at 12:00.
1530	B: really?
1531	B: thank you. that's very nice of you.
1532	B: i will.
1533	A: you're welcome.
1534	B: all right.
1535	B: thank you, sir. hope to see you again soon.
1536	B: great. she'll be so happy.
1537	B: my mom just wants everything to be perfect for us.
1538	B: i think producers are underestimating the audience. they should think of better ways to entertain the general public.
1539	A: oh i' m sorry. i think i' ll call later. thank you.
1540	A: ok, i' ll have it sent to you immediately.
1541	B: all right. just give me the ticket.
1542	B: i am glad you let me know that you will be missing class. get well!
1543	B: ok.
1544	A: there is a reason in what you say.
1545	A: yeah, you too!
1546	A: have a nice flight back, and take care. thanks for your call.
1547	A: gate 29c. have a nice flight.
1548	A: let me see ...
1549	B: i'll try.
1550	A: would you mind my keeping it for another week?
1551	B: how many bids had been placed before you?
1552	B: then you go out to the garage and check out the camping gear.
1553	A: thank you. i will.
1554	B: ok, thanks.
1555	A: of course, madam.
1556	B: take-out, please.
1557	A: oh, congratulations!
1558	B: sounds good.
1559	B: i really appreciate your help.
1560	A: yes, but you have to calculate a little.you paid fifty dollars and you fell down fifty times.so you only spent one dollar per fall. that's cheap.
1561	A: thank you.
1562	B: thank you so much!
1563	B: you' re welcome.
1564	B: yes, so it really doesn't matter who offers the money.the paper itself is profitable.
1565	A: ok, i'll try. i'll call you again if that doesn't work.
1566	B: thanks.
1567	B: you should take a look at all the companies, choose your favorite ones, go over to talk with the interviewer and leave your resume in the end.
1568	B: the more you work, the more you earn.
1569	B: no. the company pays for everything. doesn't this sound very attractive? this is why our company can always get the best employees!
1570	A: see you. have a good journey.
1571	B: hey, that sounds a good idea.
1572	B: all right. i' m glad i could clarify things for you.
1573	B: it's the canon.
1574	B: you have no choice, so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time.
1575	A: i' ll have apple pie too, but without ice cream. i have to watch my weight.
1576	B: i see why it lags behind other towns.
1577	B: your daughter should get straight a's from now on. good-bye.
1578	A: good night, sleep tight; don' t let the bed bugs bite!
1579	B: because that company's behavior is not in accordance with international law.
1580	B: a new broom sweeps clean anyway.
1581	B: thanks, but i'll stick with some jasmine tea. i'm trying to watch my diet.
1582	A: i'm not sure. let me give a call to find out.
1583	B: hopefully, i' ll get accepted to ucla.
1584	B: no way to know.
1585	A: thanks for the warning, mom.
1586	B: sure. please wait for a moment.
1587	A: all right. i will begin boarding soon.
1588	A: thank you.
1589	B: normally it can be completed in four years.
1590	B: goodbye.
1591	B: pass him.
1592	A: yes, i will get you one.
1593	A: that' s for sure. you' ll know our products better after the visit.
1594	B: thank you.
1595	A: we usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients. the boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them. it' s also a chance to put forward su
1596	B: crazy!
1597	A: cool! well, let's go over there to join mom. i want to tell her all about the special pests-killing method.
1598	B: good luck!
1599	A: take it easy. be confident. i'm sure you can do it.
1600	B: forgive me darling. i'm very tired.
1601	B: thank you. please bring us a bottle of dry white wine.
1602	A: thank you very much.
1603	B: do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class. good luck!
1604	B: great! let's make a reservation.
1605	B: i'll finish soon.
1606	B: ok, please have me arrange one.
1607	A: oh, i see. fortunately government has taken some action to prevent such things.
1608	A: don't hurry. wait for my call.
1609	B: no problem, i love it.thank you for granting me the interview.
1610	B: i'm sorry. i forgot to show you the lid. it comes with the pan.
1611	B: thanks a lot.
1612	B: mr .: i'll drop by later to check on you.
1613	B: it's not like him to be late.
1614	A: no problem. please fill in this transfer form that will authorise us to send the amount from the securities company to your account.
1615	B: yeah, it sure would.
1616	B: ok. thanks for your support.
1617	A: you know our boss always trying to save the last penny. we have to use up the equipment first.
1618	A: yeah. people down our way hardly speak to each other.
1619	B: yes, you definitely will.
1620	A: thank you for saying so.
1621	A: but number 13 buses leave from the center of town. you'll have to walk two miles to catch one.
1622	B: don't make a fuss.the price is rising
1623	A: they are by new models now, they are not very expensive. maybe you should look for one.
1624	B: well, i thought he was, but he ends up to be a con man.
1625	A: bye.
1626	B: yes. commission will be given on the basis of your sales revenue. and the percentage will be 2% of your total revenue.
1627	B: ah, it' s hard to say.
1628	B: someone was in the way.
1629	B: 4945939. marvellous! thanks for your help.
1630	B: that's all right. we don't go to bed early.
1631	B: crazy is too kind. insane is more like it. nuts! wacko! psycho!
1632	B: i couldn't agree with you more.
1633	A: no. it's confiscated for now. and i will return it to you after i finish reading it.
1634	B: oh, how i wish this all wasn't happening!
1635	B: great. my face will turn even redder!
1636	A: it's summer in sydney so you have to bring your summer wear.
1637	B: is there anything i can do to help? just remember that i'm there for you if you want to talk about it.
1638	B: both the new paint and new carpet will be finished by next week.
1639	A: ok. the last piece is for your dessert. we're having dinner soon.
1640	B: by the end of this month, at the latest.
1641	B: oh look! here it comes now!
1642	B: fine.have a nice stay here.
1643	A: but his daughter is a very nice girl.
1644	B: yes, in this position i was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company. with the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about five percent, which had a direct impact on revenue.
1645	B: here is a guiding plan.
1646	B: hum ...
1647	A: maybe. i'll have to ask my mother.
1648	A: ok, ok. enough already. we'd better hustle. the contest starts in five minutes.
1649	A: you're welcome.
1650	B: you should be excited about your first vote.
1651	A: get out of my store, you jerk!
1652	B: see you tomorrow.
1653	B: ok. here you are.
1654	A: good! do you have any questions?
1655	A: no, not yet. but susan says they' d like to get married in november or december. then they' ll go to hawaii for their honeymoon.
1656	B: you're quite welcome.
1657	B: bye-bye!
1658	B: fine, madam. when will mr. brent be arriving, and how many nights will he be staying?
1659	A: that's a good idea. you are really creative.
1660	A: thank you.
1661	B: you won't have to wait a second, sir.
1662	B: you're quite right.but many japanese learners begin with smiles on their faces and end up with tears in their eyes.
1663	B: no, i don' t like regular work. i am interested in different projects with new opportunities and new challenges, but i can do regular work if the company needs me to do so.
1664	B: nine would be perfect. i'll see you then!
1665	B: $ 800 dollars.
1666	B: so remember to set your alarm clock.
1667	B: thank you.
1668	B: thanks a lot.
1669	B: ok.
1670	B: hold on
1671	A: what a waste. it's good to see some stars that are more concerned with charity than status symbols.
1672	A: let me think about it. what should i do? i think i will not give up.
1673	A: it moved slowly up the stairs, step by step, and i could hear its approaching footsteps. when it finally got to the top of the stairs, i realized that it was my father in his green pajamas. he had gone to get a late night snack.
1674	B: sure. i'll be back in a minute.
1675	B: i'm not sure whether i can pass the course or not.
1676	B: a lot of people feel the same way.
1677	B: yes, i do. what do you see as the future trends for the industry?
1678	B: ok, here is your change.
1679	B: i don't blame you, sir. two dollars is a lot of money.
1680	A: perhaps i should have a try.
1681	A: no, not at all! just lay back and relax.
1682	A: oh, it' s love at first sight.
1683	A: i don't want to miss it today.
1684	B: i'd like both.
1685	B: mind your own business.
1686	B: it will do.
1687	B: it's $ 32.00.
1688	A: i ran into the guardrail when i turned to the left.
1689	B: dad, it's not fair. i am so disappointed with you!
1690	A: here is the agenda for the meeting and that's all for the messages.
1691	B: ok with me. you are the boss. i will meet you downstairs after work.
1692	A: sounds cool! but that is not what a lady should do. people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk.
1693	B: thank you.
1694	A: ok, by the way, fill the gas tank when you return the car.
1695	B: have a heart, honey. you know i am trying hard to quit drinking, don't you? just give me one more chance, please!
1696	A: that's right. i could stand to lose a few pounds, too.
1697	B: yes, my sister loves his personality.
1698	B: ok, how about midnight curfew. and i'll let you know where i am.
1699	B: that's my buffer ... i wanted to leave a little room in the budget, just in case---it's better to be safe than sorry.
1700	B: go ahead. it will be safe with me.
1701	B: are you suggesting that anyone can be?
1702	B: we can do that. it'll just cost you extra.
1703	B: be careful of yourself.
1704	B: well, we've just finished laying the cabling and we're waiting for the safety inspector to give us the go-ahead to continue. i'm just going to meet him. do you want to come?
1705	A: sure, welcome anytime
1706	B: you're right.make - up can only disguise my age, but exercise may delay it.
1707	B: it' s a very important experience for me. first, it improved my organizing ability, and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective. second, it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who i like or dislike.
1708	B: you could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want.
1709	B: that's right.
1710	B: okay. take your time.
1711	A: that's fine.
1712	B: you can say that again.
1713	B: in my mind, salary is not the most important thing.
1714	B: i'll try to speak in another language or i'll try my best to use gestures and draw pictures.
1715	B: is the pay good?
1716	B: thanks.
1717	A: yes, sure. it is no. 50 in the fifth avenue where there is a fairground and a museum.
1718	B: i' m awfully sorry to hear that. i' ll turn to it right away.
1719	B: but i think a master degree is good enough for a girl.
1720	B: then you will be in line for a doom.
1721	B: don' t be silly, john. i' m going with you. it' s necessary for me to have a holiday too.
1722	B: you're right. i'm not going to play games during school anymore.
1723	B: there won't be many other expenses expect food.
1724	A: thanks.
1725	B: oh, sorry! there's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks.
1726	B: thank you.
1727	B: thank you for your concern.
1728	A: okay, thanks very much.
1729	B: but joe won't you.
1730	B: be careful, the cartridge can be very hot.
1731	A: that explains it.
1732	A: too risky anyway.it ' s necessary to look before you leap.
1733	B: that' s why it was so weird traveling from beijing to la! because of the huge time difference, even though we left beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours, we still arrived in la the same day at noon! it' s like we went back in time!
1734	A: that will be six dollars. out of ten-seven, eight, nine, ten. thank you.
1735	B: i'd like you to replace this one without charge if you can.
1736	B: thanks honey! you have such great fashion sense.now, what am i going to do with my hair?
1737	A: you can send a compressed one.
1738	B: thank you very much.
1739	A: it would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want.
1740	A: mine aren't fixed. sometimes i do the day shift, sometimes the night shift.
1741	A: i noticed they've taken our radio and left the television.
1742	B: too bad.
1743	B: i do back flips at the pool all the time.
1744	A: i'm always at your service.
1745	B: (beep) this is miriam lavalle â that's spelt l, a, v, a, l, l, e. it's about an appointment i made with simon meredith. i'm afraid i'm going to have to change it. can you call me? the number is 01563 566 770. thank you.
1746	A: i believe such things won' t be realized, just daydreaming.
1747	B: the notification period of my current job is not that long and i' m quite profession to english and i am happy with the traveling abroad as i' m good dealing with the people from other cultures. it makes the whole job even more interesting. i will send my resume to you still this week.
1748	B: you know, i am a waitress at the student center. anyway now those final exams are almost over. i' d love a night out.
1749	B: yeah. he told me that he has passed over in the election of monitor.
1750	A: yes, there are. they tell use which way to go and how far we have to walk.
1751	B: we'd better leave him alone.
1752	B: that' s my final offer. take it or leave it.
1753	B: the hot drinks first would be great. thanks!
1754	B: well, thanks for your help.
1755	B: pleased to meet you too, ms jenson.
1756	B: oh, it's hard to narrow it down to just one. i mean, i like all kinds of sports, basketball, swimming, bike riding and so on. maybe it is just the reason why i am so energetic and vigorous.
1757	A: yeah, sure. your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents. here is your receipt. have a nice day.
1758	B: congratulations on the new apartment.
1759	A: thank you.
1760	B: well, it's quite different from the chinese food.
1761	B: this pc is top of the line and i guarantee it will never freeze! if it does, we' ll give you your money back!
1762	B: yes, sir.
1763	B: that was my line, mark. i know we worked on the ad together, but that was definitely my line.
1764	B: i prefer a variety show without a host.
1765	B: i trust him.
1766	A: you'll know our products better after this visit.
1767	A: thank you, david.
1768	B: ok.
1769	A: ok.thank you.
1770	A: wow, that's unbelievable! you play so well, but you've never been to a real teacher. you will definitely be famous in the near future.
1771	B: no, i wasn't. it's kind of hard to watch the road when joseph is behind the wheel.
1772	B: it's my dream.
1773	B: a barrel of fun, of course. he often says that i'm a date bait.
1774	B: remember us for all your computer needs.
1775	A: mr .: here. write your name inside the front cover. remember that you must return the textbook to me at the end of the semester, so keep it in good condition.
1776	A: that'd be great! thank you.
1777	B: it won't be but a few seconds, sir.
1778	A: thank you!
1779	A: yes, i'll give you some pills. take one a time and three times a day, and come back in three days. if you don't feel ...
1780	B: they're okay, i guess.
1781	B: i understand that. still, i'm not in a position to help you. maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together.
1782	B: you are a lost cause.
1783	B: oh, sure.
1784	A: oh, look! there's a spot open next to the public restroom! can i take it?
1785	A: oh. i'm just going to take it easy.
1786	B: that's right. you won't have that problem with del.
1787	B: too bad.
1788	A: who knows! that might come to later.
1789	B: i feel they're dirty.
1790	B: i think i do. i don't think i can be happier with another girl.
1791	B: toss a coin to decide then.
1792	B: if you ever need a job, let me know. i can always train you.
1793	B: that's great. thank you very much.
1794	B: no, i enjoy travelling.
1795	A: oh! i see. i'll have the paperback, please,
1796	B: sounds fine.
1797	B: coffee, please.
1798	A: fine, i' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on thursday.
1799	B: sure. i'll give you mine too. then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason.
1800	B: would you ask him to tell us more about the country?
1801	A: thanks, that's would be lovely.you ' r right, he is kind and nice looking.
1802	B: that suits me fine.
1803	B: that's right. we should try to be laid back and not do lots of things to bother one another.
1804	B: it's easier said than done. when you actually play, it can be very frustrating.
1805	B: fair to middling. a little hard to appreciate.
1806	B: but we still need to go back to it. don't overdo it.
1807	B: i' m a gs - 15. that' s high on the scale of workers, but even a gs - 1 is paid a living wage.
1808	B: thank you very much.
1809	B: glad to hear it.
1810	A: thank you. now i know how to travel by air.
1811	B: ok. you drive and do be careful.
1812	B: i will try.
1813	B: oh, no problem. here's the lid that comes with the pan.
1814	A: me too. have a great day.
1815	B: yes, it is much earlier than past years.
1816	B: thank you.
1817	A: it could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets. in any case, i' ll administer an anesthetic and you won' t feel a thing!
1818	B: he is out.
1819	B: you forgot all about it, didn't you?
1820	B: yes, next saturday. i hope you can make it.
1821	A: ok. i will pay it by my bank card.
1822	B: at lease they stayed the same. that's better than dropping.
1823	A: see you.
1824	B: come on.
1825	B: no problem.
1826	B: just relax, listen carefully to the questions, and be honest in your responses.
1827	A: bye!
1828	B: why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on?
1829	A: ms .: that's right.
1830	A: thanks a lot. give me one ticket, please.
1831	B: thank you. i' ll try my best.
1832	B: i am glad you like it. welcome next time.
1833	B: why asking that? it's often the sort of dutch treat.
1834	A: afternoon, please, if that's possible.
1835	B: well ...
1836	A: a barber shop ?!
1837	A: i' m sorry, sir. i' m going to have to take a look inside your bag.
1838	B: yes, sir, it's $ 20.
1839	A: that's fine.
1840	A: i see.we had a table reserved for you.this way, please.
1841	B: we could always wait for the next bus to come.
1842	B: i'm pretty satisfied with it. i can broaden my experience, learn lots of new things, and have more development opportunities.
1843	A: yes. the government has limited funds and must show that it is using the money responsibly
1844	A: yes, that's all in order. let's get this processed for you, then.
1845	B: thank you very much. hope you enjoy your stay.
1846	B: that would be great! you are really a good employee.
1847	A: honda is ok.
1848	B: that's better.
1849	B: precisely, the actions the countries have committed to take are consistent with to agreement.
1850	B: yeah. i'm going to my locker to get my jacket. catch you later.
1851	A: no, thank you.
1852	A: yeah, that makes sense.
1853	A: thanks a lot.
1854	A: i wish i hadn't chosen this job.
1855	A: i do. i don't know what to do after i retire. i'd like to work till i drop.
1856	B: boring? how can it be boring? it sounds very interesting to me.
1857	B: but it's sunday, isn't it?
1858	B: all right. thank you very much.
1859	B: well, such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like beijing. i think a still more desirable benefit is psychological. bicycling home after work can help release your stress. life in the offices is miserable. you just sit there in a daze, gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents. why don't you give a full play to your energy after work? enjoy the speed on the road. just think, you are flashing past the poles with your own energy. how great!
1860	A: come on. i'll introduce you two.
1861	B: i think i am extroverted.
1862	A: well, in that case. i will call the manger, you can talk directly with him.
1863	A: i didn' t say that either. i was hoping we could discuss the matter together. i want your advice but i don' t want you to tell me what to do. i' ve got to make decisions for myself, dad.
1864	B: go right ahead.
1865	B: basketball and swimming.
1866	B: glad you asked me to join you. this will be fun!
1867	B: my mother is an english teacher in a college, so i began learning english when i could speak, and i took english as my minor subject at university.
1868	B: okay, i won't forget.
1869	B: i really have to get to paris by this evening.would you please try to find any other available flight?
1870	B: i'm sorry.
1871	B: thank you. i will.
1872	B: it'll start on lst september.
1873	B: i'll throw out the garbage.
1874	A: thank you, i will. hope to see you again next year.
1875	B: you got it.
1876	A: that would definitely make a difference. but vince already said no.
1877	B: stop picking on me. i am going to be mad.
1878	A: because it is an age of challenges, i must accept the new challenge in my life.
1879	B: no problem, sir. but it will cost you extra.
1880	A: thanks. you too.
1881	B: don' t be silly, john. i' m going with you. it' s necessary for me to have a holiday too.
1882	B: then you will be in line for a doom.
1883	B: i know, but i'm going to enroll in a night school to take a course in business management.
1884	B: honey, please. you're the only woman for me, forever. i swear it.
1885	B: no, really. i'm not in the mood for it.
1886	B: yes, in some ways it was a step down from my previous job but it did offer me much better prospects for the future.
1887	A: just make sure children don' t play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers.
1888	B: we cannot expect a man like him to speak the truth.
1889	A: no problem.
1890	A: don't worry. you'll do better next time.
1891	B: yes, please. i'll really appreciate that.
1892	B: 0kay. dinner's on me.
1893	A: i'll try the vegetarian, please.
1894	B: and humility. i would have liked to meet him personally.
1895	B: well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet. you'll have to use the lab.
1896	B: that settles it then. 5,000 rib it is, thanks.
1897	B: yes, it's one of my hobbies.
1898	B: where to?
1899	B: take some medicine and stay in bed for a day or two.
1900	A: i've created a monster ... you're a better bayer than me!
1901	A: i can ask for some advice from him.
1902	A: we share the same bathroom, in other words.
1903	A: to each their own!
1904	B: this one i'd better chat with the manager. could you give me a second?
1905	B: next left then right? ok.
1906	B: it's raining cats and dogs.
1907	A: it would be much simpler and cheaper if they negotiated first.
1908	B: i have exactly the same feeling. this afternoon he explained the ins and outs of the stock market to me. he knows a lot about investments.
1909	B: try to catch this bouquet then.
1910	B: don't mention it.
1911	A: my pleasure.
1912	B: yeah, i make certain. a half-price ticket cuts us one point five yuan.
1913	B: are you kidding? it' s summer.
1914	B: to the office. i'll be right back.
1915	B: these are from guatemala, but we're going to start getting mangoes from india.
1916	A: so-so.
1917	B: besides, don't make it too loose.
1918	A: you can always take it again.
1919	B: sure, let's. goodbye, then.
1920	B: you'd better tell your sister what happened and face the music.
1921	B: oh, its nothing.
1922	B: always be honest with your answers. the interviewers really do want to know if you will be a good fit for them.
1923	B: yes. there are selected itineraries for rich and high-tasted people, common routine for people who are on trade observation tour, and excursion routine for people who have limited time for sightseeing.
1924	B: really? that's unbelievable.
1925	A: oh, my jump rope. mom, can you get it for me?
1926	B: you can see the doctor of your choice then, and we will see you at your scheduled appointment time.
1927	B: whatever you say. i just want to get to my meeting!
1928	B: no wonder when i pass your room, i always hear your laughter.
1929	B: ok. we will e-mail you all the information you need tomorrow. have a good day!
1930	B: no, but we' ll provide you with good businesses at the end of the year.
1931	A: i hope that we can continue our cooperation.
1932	B: and one more thing, smile widely.
1933	B: dear, this bakery has introduced some new types of cake recently and you can eat as much as you can.
1934	B: maybe now i' ll get that promotion i was hoping for.
1935	B: i hope so.
1936	B: john smith. j-o-h-n s-m-i-t-h.
1937	A: oh, i'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain.
1938	A: well, i don' t mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments. look, they are making photos now of my designed kitchen.
1939	A: ok, mum. i will not fail the examination next time.
1940	B: i' ll tell you all you need to know.
1941	B: it's my pleasure to talk with you.
1942	B: the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
1943	A: do you have any different ideas?
1944	A: you are really a hen-pecked husband.
1945	A: not, if you don' t want to.
1946	A: wonderful. i'd like to know why you're interested in this position at our paper.
1947	A: good-bye. see you again sometime.
1948	B: ok! i'll call security.
1949	A: yes, i know.
1950	B: well i' m definitely a team player as well as being highly self-motivated. i believe this company can fulfill my long-term goals and offer me great upward mobility. therefore you will find in me
1951	B: sure, why not?
1952	B: that would be great.
1953	B: that' s right, once a week. do you want to order some pizza?
1954	B: you are so thoughtful.
1955	B: i think you know that you have to make the best decision for you. enjoy your year!
1956	B: not for me. it is already late. i can not fall asleep after drinking coffee this late.
1957	B: she said that she didn' t want to foul her own nest.
1958	B: the cold weather will damage the engine.
1959	A: thanks.
1960	A: ah ... very well, sir. i'll have them delivered this afternoon.
1961	A: okay, but you are going to be my masterpiece!
1962	B: yes, a little. i know your school is one of the best known in this town. there are about 200 children in the school.
1963	B: i always make time for family.
1964	A: that will be great.
1965	A: yeah, at least when we are children, we have not so much homework to do.
1966	A: it's the same in my family. the coffee table in my living room is covered with copies of fashion.
1967	B: hmm. i hope not.
1968	B: well! i guess people don' t find him so peculiar anymore.
1969	A: i see.
1970	B: dishonesty. it' s unacceptable.
1971	B: we are such weirdos right?
1972	A: you're very welcome.
1973	A: thank you very much.
1974	B: you' re welcome. have a nice day.
1975	B: all right. come in on friday at 11
1976	B: i must to ask you to reconsider your decision and give me a chance.
1977	B: but how guilty to waste food!
1978	B: you will make it if you persist in it.
1979	B: you're welcome.
1980	A: thank you so much!
1981	A: that's a good idea!
1982	B: you are welcome.
1983	B: people who are honest, dedicated to their work and having integrity.
1984	B: he must have a good ear.
1985	A: are you kidding? the yen is in worse shape than the dollar!
1986	A: it says, zina, i like how you rhumba. an admirer.
1987	A: are you kidding? it's too early for her.
1988	A: oh, actually, tuesday' s no good. sorry about that.
1989	B: oh, i understand.
1990	B: thank you.
1991	A: come on! they only do that to get even more publicity for their films and themselves.
1992	A: thank you so much.
1993	A: please don't forget to say good-bye to the rest of the family for me.
1994	A: 6:30. my room number is 305.
1995	B: i'm a great cook actually. you will see.
1996	A: don' t worry. we' ll just get a doggie bag.
1997	B: well, i understand that. your request is approved. remember to give my best regards to your parents.
1998	A: ha ha. i know what you mean. but it's just a movie. they need for the characters to do that.
1999	A: i' m afraid not, bob. one of the major volcanoes in mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region. meanwhile, mexico' s coast has been hit by hurricane liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit central america, affecting honduras, guatemala and panama. that' s all the news we have for today, but stay tuned for updates on the six o' clock news. back to you bob.
2000	A: my men began searching the area as soon as we received your call. i can't promise you that we'll recover your property but we'll certainly do our best.
2001	A: oh baby, i' m so sorry.
2002	B: i think so.we certainly don't want a hijack to happen on the plane today.
2003	B: that' s why they often have long roots to find water spines instead of leaves, to reduce water loss.
2004	A: thank you.
2005	A: perhaps. i'm dead tired.
2006	B: thank you so much. you're an expert.
2007	B: that's one way of putting it. for me, a job needs to stimulate my brain, otherwise it becomes a daily drudgery.
2008	B: well, i haven't thought much about this. i think it's too early to tell. what is most important for me now is to do the best possible job for the company and learn and develop my skills as much as possible.
2009	B: it is still a mystery to me.
2010	B: it's super.
2011	B: so so.
2012	B: thanks for the visit, betty.
2013	B: okay, let's call it a day.
2014	A: i made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy. we should be able to get plenty of customers.
2015	B: you see ... money doesn't equal happiness, but it takes away a lot of responsibilities.
2016	B: seventy to sixty-seven.
2017	A: good-bye.
2018	B: yeah, wear formal clothes to your interview and do be punctual. that'll leave your interviewers with a good first impression.
2019	A: because i've already proved it. smoking's the easiest thing in the world to give up. i've done it hundreds of times!
2020	B: thanks. wendy. there will be an important dinner party tonight. so i must make me the focus of my friends.
2021	B: no problem at all, mike. just give me the chance.
2022	B: nine is a great time to get started. i'll see you on saturday!
2023	A: let me have it, please. i'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway.
2024	B: that will probably take care of your symptoms. i' ll see you tomorrow.
2025	B: that's correct. thank you very much.
2026	B: thank you.
2027	B: i'm sorry, but you were the only one who had access to it.
2028	A: good idea!
2029	B: well, the weather might have some influence, during bad weather the theater didn't make a whole lot.
2030	B: it's a problem. you'd better move.
2031	B: i see. thanks for your help.
2032	A: if he doesn't change his attitude toward work, i don't think a new job can make any difference.
2033	A: i see.
2034	B: because i have other obligations.
2035	B: that's good. see you on friday.
2036	B: in thailand. i taught english there.
2037	B: oh great! does this mean that the reception is canceled?
2038	B: that is greatly appreciated and i hope you feel well enough to go to school tomorrow.
2039	A: thank you.
2040	B: well, i'll take them.
2041	A: would you, please? thank you.
2042	B: sure. once you get the hang of it, it' s a piece of cake! it' s nothing to worry about.
2043	B: that's right. his voice ranges from the smooth sound of ballads to the highpowered rhythms of the spanish caribbean where he grew up. he has fan clubs across the world, from america to russia, from england to taiwan, from norway to australia.
2044	B: oh, sorry. i' ll put it out.
2045	A: yeah, i know. a friend in need is a friend indeed. i don't need fair-weather friends either.
2046	B: sounds delicious. ok. she'll try that.
2047	B: yeah, i can' t cook anything until tomorrow, anyway.
2048	B: 15 copies for each diploma.
2049	A: you' re welcome.
2050	A: oh, i know. thank you.
2051	B: you are welcome. and, please call me betty.
2052	A: i'm sorry to hear that. thank you for telling me a little more about it.
2053	A: but the most of the transoceanic cargo transportation is still carried by boat.
2054	A: certainty, sir.
2055	B: ok. i will deposit my bag right now.
2056	A: so do i.
2057	B: ok!
2058	B: yeah, me too.
2059	B: they are in the cupboard where you keep the gravy boat and serving dishes. just be careful because the wine glasses are also there.
2060	A: oh, right. i forgot about that. sorry, i'll pay cash.
2061	B: only 2 dollars and 25 cents.
2062	B: all i'm trying to say is that life is ... like ... er ... this painting.
2063	B: no! so ... is halloween essentially the same thing as ghost month?
2064	B: all right. another time then.
2065	B: i may just go to the dmv today, so i can pay the fine.
2066	B: sixty dollars.
2067	B: i think our child is going to love it!
2068	B: of course not.sometimes a poor man can be extremely miserable.
2069	B: no, i can' t accept it. business is business.
2070	B: that sounds good. i' ll call you once i arrive.
2071	B: the problem is that many poor people might suffer.
2072	A: i see.
2073	B: i know. it' ll also help you make more money.
2074	A: you should go to the park more often since you don't go to the gym anymore!
2075	B: i work in a cubicle too, but i don't mind it.
2076	B: whatever dude, i' m going to go watch the opening match.
2077	B: that's better.
2078	A: bye now.
2079	B: that' s not right, somebody should do something.
2080	B: where did you see then last?
2081	B: ok, sir, yours will be ready in a few seconds.
2082	A: that' s my brother!
2083	B: yeah. it' s pretty.
2084	B: your order will be brought to you momentarily, sir.
2085	B: very good, we'll take them all.
2086	B: i try to adapt myself.
2087	A: no, but she gave me her friend's telephone number. i can call him and make an appointment.
2088	B: sounds ideal. we'll get back to you in a couple of days then.
2089	B: my mistake.
2090	A: thank you, thank you, thanks again.
2091	A: thank you, mr. johnson. you' ve made a guaranteed reservation at the guangzhou xx hotel, from april 16th to 20th for 5 nights. if you can' t arrive as schedule, please inform us before 6 p. m. on april. hank you for calling and we look forward to serving you
2092	A: bye.
2093	B: thank you.
2094	A: you' re welcome.
2095	B: thanks for saying so.
2096	A: by the way, what's the rate for a single room?
2097	B: yeah, i got home around two.
2098	B: he should be back in about forty minutes.
2099	A: um yeah.sorry about that.
2100	B: they do, but it doesn't help too much. having seven children means that the money situation in my home is always pretty tight.
2101	B: yes, there is, drinking your coffee!
2102	A: ok, sir. we are looking forward to your arrival.
2103	A: in my opinion, a secretary must be familiar with office routine and try to do some things by you. this is the filing cabinet and any document or file you may need. and you should file these documents in alphabetical order.
2104	A: actually, i' d prefer not to be.
2105	B: i'll have to think about it.
2106	A: thank you.
2107	B: oh, sorry about that.we ' ll get it fixed as soon as we can.
2108	B: we export to eastern europe and the far east. the domestic market accounts for about 40 percent of our total sales.
2109	A: you must have seen some other kind of bird.
2110	B: well, i think that's the only thing i can do.
2111	A: i appreciate it. it is related to company image.
2112	B: why not? i'd love to!
2113	B: oh, shut up!
2114	A: no, i' m serious.
2115	B: of course you are. i wouldn't ask you otherwise.
2116	A: yes, ten days.
2117	A: we'll meet again in a few days.
2118	A: yes, they should be put in the most attractive place, and this can appeal to passers-by's attention.
2119	B: no sweat. just go back and talk him down. here comes wei.
2120	B: $ 10 a kilo.
2121	B: i live here. i was invited by george-he's the tall guy over there. he looks a bit drunk, actually ...
2122	A: oh, boy. his wife can't be happy about that.
2123	B: let's have the salesmen for a demonstration.
2124	A: well, live and learn. it seems we'll have to waive the claim.
2125	B: you will be going northwards. you are now in the the western part of the city and the allied irish bank is situated in the north east. here's a rough sketch of the area.
2126	A: no, thanks. coffee makes me wired and i will be nervous enough carrying all that cash.
2127	B: yes, sir.
2128	B: good. i wish i could have another vacation.
2129	B: they are too bright.
2130	B: i can not belive that. it must be cooked up by someone.
2131	B: that' s all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we' ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna! till next time!
2132	A: keep your back straight and look forward. good. do about 3 sets of 20.
2133	B: i' m sorry. i thought we were all pretty much in agreement.
2134	A: of course, i'm sure you will like it.
2135	B: absolutely.
2136	B: are you deaf or what?
2137	B: thank you again!
2138	B: well, i guess so.
2139	B: yes, with pleasure.
2140	B: well. don't worry about it, i will be happy to share the taxi with you.
2141	A: you' re welcome. good-bye.
2142	A: fairly expensive.
2143	B: i love it. it's so festive! and where did you get that cup? it's got the same logo as the car.
2144	A: arthur, that' s the bathroom.
2145	A: you too.
2146	A: oh, of course.
2147	B: your room number is 707. here is your key. the bellhop will help you carry the suitcases to your room. have a nice evening!
2148	B: if you want to cross here, be my guest. i don' t feel like dodging cars and scooters!
2149	A: david, stop dreaming. it' s time to do your homework.
2150	B: i think tv is a great waste of time, so i would only have one small tv in the kitchen to watch the news in the morning.
2151	A: that's one of the problems with having an ipod. though an ipod might have an above average battery life, once the battery is dead, so is your ipod.
2152	B: for here or to go?
2153	A: could you take it to that counter, please?
2154	B: that's great, exactly what i need to know. thanks.
2155	B: now you should know the rest. don't forget to dial taipei's city code.
2156	A: oh, you men! you're all the same.
2157	B: that's fine. but you have to pay another $ 10.
2158	B: sure thing.
2159	B: not at all.
2160	B: my pleasure.
2161	A: not if you take off your jacket.
2162	B: i knew that already.
2163	B: they don't mind.
2164	B: sure. the main courses i took included commercial accounting, cost accounting, industrial accounting, electronic accounting, and so on.
2165	B: she can cope with it. don' t be such a wimp!
2166	B: uh ... no.
2167	A: they're in awe of her. after they saw how she crushed webtracker ... but i guess you know all about that.
2168	B: ok, someone will be there by 12:15.
2169	A: i guess cooking is not as easy as i thought.
2170	A: that's a great idea. i'm going to do the same.
2171	B: at 7 am sharp.
2172	A: ok. a reservation for eight at7: 30, room 208. please don't be more than half hour late, or we will have to give it to other guests.
2173	B: thanks for the information. and good luck in your college search.
2174	B: good. thank you very much.
2175	A: stop worrying, mary. you'll do just fine.
2176	A: thank you. i appreciate your help.
2177	A: next time you come in here, i will recognize you.
2178	B: i don't know.
2179	B: it costs less to wash here.
2180	B: well, let's take the measurements right now.
2181	B: in a way, it' s similar to your experience of learning chinese. some spanish words are very similar to english ones. but i need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself.
2182	B: forgive me. you're 100 percent correct. allow me to transfer you to my supervisor.
2183	A: the creditor's equity is the same as liabilities.
2184	B: ok. i'll tell her.
2185	B: merry christmas to you.
2186	B: no problem. have a good one.
2187	B: it is ok with me. i enjoy being busy and learning new things.
2188	A: it's not expensive. ok. i'll take them.
2189	B: this one is 5% off. that one has no reduction, but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes.
2190	A: yes. that's what we want.
2191	A: good.
2192	B: you'd like it.
2193	B: the individual landlord's numbers are next to each entry. you can call them with any questions you may have.
2194	B: right, that's fine. i'd like it to get there as quickly as possible.
2195	B: yes. i want a first class single ticket.
2196	B: just a second. i' ll go get some.
2197	A: that' s great. but i prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain.
2198	B: of course, i should have been more careful. i' m sorry.
2199	A: okay. that will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents.
2200	B: leave me alone.
2201	A: i'll call the tourist information centre to check.
2202	B: it is. i hope you' ll have time to come for a visit soon. you really should come during the summer, when the weather is better and there' s more happening outdoors.
2203	B: i don't know. check the flyer or check with the produce person.
2204	A: yes, you may enjoy a seven-day paid holiday in the first year. after that, you can have two more days each year.
2205	B: get in.
2206	B: until 8 o'clock madam. we are looking forward to seeing you.
2207	B: i suppose you need the whiteboard set up.
2208	B: it's super.
2209	A: see you.
2210	B: that's exactly how i feel.
2211	B: it's out of the question.
2212	B: sure. in fact, nowadays, you'll see more tourists there than italians. there are mafia tours nowadays that go there to eat.
2213	B: yes, you are right.
2214	A: well, tina says she would be able to handle it and concentrate on her own work, easier set them done. but working harder and concentrating only on the job might well helped to overcome the initial stress of the breakup.
2215	A: last year he helped me out of trouble, too.
2216	B: i see. thank you.
2217	B: whoa.
2218	A: oh, that's a nasty cough. let me feel your head. you're on fire!
2219	B: i think he' s the boy who just moved into my apartment building.
2220	B: thank you very much. i will let you know as soon as possible.
2221	B: thank you.
2222	B: well, as far as i can see, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. you've sold me! i'd like to go ahead.
2223	A: that's not bad. let's go.
2224	A: don't lose this receipt, because insurance companies are very difficult about helping when they don't have the right paperwork.
2225	A: no worries.
2226	A: no wonder you like the class so much.
2227	B: yes. it' s a lovely view.
2228	B: i must, if i want to pass the course.
2229	B: you are welcome.
2230	B: ok, thank you.
2231	B: then let's stay in a motel. i am sure you will like it.
2232	B: you can't be serious.
2233	A: i will.
2234	A: it sounds like you've learned something useful this year!
2235	A: it' s my pleasure.
2236	B: yes, i agree.
2237	A: bye-bye.
2238	A: hey, thanks, mum.
2239	B: thanks and you too.
2240	B: by doing whatever is necessary.
2241	B: lots of people especially seniors like to go to church, and attend the evening service.
2242	B: oysters, please.
2243	B: i know, i'm sorry.
2244	B: leave me alone.
2245	B: ok. i close my mouth.
2246	B: yes! the first time i saw her i knew we would fall in love.
2247	B: what! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping? this is not happening!
2248	B: in a cushioned sleeper, please.
2249	B: i really don't know what to buy.
2250	B: many people like him get a flying start but soon disappear.
2251	B: no.thanks. i'm full.
2252	A: great. see you then.
2253	B: it's just you!
2254	B: then he is really lucky.
2255	A: good point. this is sarah o' connell reporting live from washington d. c ., back to you, tom.
2256	B: no, he didn't scold me because he was late, too.
2257	A: i guess so.
2258	B: ok, i got it.
2259	B: yeah, i know. you are right.
2260	B: see? and i bet that's easy to do online. everybody's anonymous.
2261	B: great!
2262	B: that' s not my fault.
2263	B: i've never been better, thanks.
2264	A: i will. thanks a lot.
2265	B: ok, just a moment. i'll find the relevant data and help you with that.
2266	A: you have to fill out this form, ma'am.
2267	B: all right, all right. he'll get them as soon as possible.
2268	B: thanks!
2269	B: it's good to be home.
2270	B: not that long ago! i' m not more than twenty-nine myself.
2271	B: okay. check you later.
2272	B: i' m afraid i' ll be late.
2273	B: as you wish, sir. you'll have a wonderful time there.
2274	A: so, he' s not a bookworm? it' s good that he has an outgoing personality. some kids are very quiet and introverted. you wonder they' ll survive in the real world without their parents to support them.
2275	A: ok, you win. you pick the restaurant this time.
2276	B: really? good for you.
2277	B: you are the one i should thank. you've done really great job.
2278	A: bye, ann!
2279	A: you're welcome. happy couples need mutual understanding.
2280	B: the regular price is $ 2980.00, but until december the 31st it ' s on sale for just $ 2,699. 00.
2281	B: my domicile place is nanjing, too.
2282	B: that's all right.
2283	B: aspirin.
2284	B: quite sure. i mean that hair of hers and the voice of hers.
2285	A: i agree with you.
2286	B: yes, amy, please have some more.
2287	B: sure. what's up?
2288	A: ok, just follow me.
2289	A: thank you.
2290	A: thanks.
2291	B: certainly, perhaps.
2292	B: well, nothing more than a jumble of photographs.
2293	A: yeah, but scented tea is now in fashion.
2294	B: sounds not good. i won't take it.
2295	B: thank you for reminding me. i'll continue to exercise as soon as i finish this project.
2296	A: it's fine. please wrap it.
2297	A: it sounds interesting.
2298	B: all right.
2299	B: two small boxes.
2300	B: that's great.
2301	B: maybe we should call its after-service man.
2302	A: thank you very much.
2303	A: i'm in the personnel department.
2304	B: you've got it, sir.
2305	B: so long. have a nice weekend.
2306	B: yes, please.
2307	B: no problem, just get rid of the bugs!
2308	A: not funny.
2309	A: therefore, i hope they could help each other and learn from each other.
2310	B: he kept trying to make stupid excuses, and then broke down and admitted to a small indiscretion.
2311	B: there are a plenty of signs such as watch for children!
2312	A: take a look at this dress. don't you think it's perfect for you, ma'am? uh, where are you going, ma'am? ma'am?
2313	B: i also think good advertising is essential to call attention to a product and introduce our l-series products. meanwhile, ads are also the representation of the company's image.
2314	A: well, if you want to help your friend, you should do something about it.
2315	A: that's true. ok, i will think about it.
2316	A: thank you very much.
2317	B: okay. thanks for your help.
2318	B: eleven o'clock on friday morning. see you then.
2319	A: i'm a student too.
2320	A: oh, i'm afraid all the flowers will die in the rain.
2321	B: thanks.
2322	B: i am going to be a, well, i hope to be a research chemist.
2323	B: i am afraid not. i have no interest in them at all.
2324	B: bye.
2325	B: i believe i would have better opportunities with a small but rapidly expanding company like yours.
2326	B: oh, you poor thing!
2327	B: sure.
2328	A: i think we are running out of time. the bank is going to close soon.
2329	B: of course. mary is our most experienced member.
2330	B: are you serious?
2331	B: i think so.
2332	B: i think i'm going to make myself some oatmeal and toast.
2333	B: excuse me while i go and get that.
2334	B: not really, but i like watching.
2335	B: i appreciate that.
2336	A: yes, that' s all right. thank you very much.
2337	B: yes, i want to restate one more time the importance of reinventing our company's image to appeal to different customer bases. i want to end with a true story that has to do exactly with what we've been talking about today ...
2338	B: your company is well-known for its good corporate profile and rapid growing records. i want to work for a company that can display my abilities and talents.
2339	B: so the other party could be across the world or just on the other side of the street!
2340	B: maybe we can enjoy the tv play together. it's interesting.
2341	A: ok, i'll give it a go.
2342	B: right.
2343	A: thank you, you too.
2344	B: no.you can't suddenly make smoking illegal. but the government could prohibit smoking in public places like cinemas and theaters.
2345	A: i think i have traits of both, actually. i look more like my mother.
2346	A: everything i've seen so far is very impressive, very impressive indeed.
2347	B: why don't you start cooking then?
2348	B: yes, twice.
2349	A: it's still early.
2350	B: yes, 50 yuan per month.
2351	B: that' s it. thank you.
2352	A: ok, i' ll take a return ticket on the soft sleeper please.
2353	B: would you please give to me, and will imprint it?
2354	A: no problem, miss.
2355	B: that was it! thank you for coming in today.
2356	B: no problem, here you are.
2357	B: not all of it.
2358	B: well, then, i'll talk to you later. have a good day!
2359	B: if you want some changes, just tell me.
2360	B: i see.
2361	A: you can say that again.
2362	B: yup.
2363	A: oh, i think i should try to read one.
2364	A: all right! thanks!
2365	B: can't hurt to try. carpe diem. who can say if we'll be here tomorrow or not?
2366	B: you are welcome.
2367	A: maybe i should go and ask him whether it's true.
2368	A: can you bring me something? i am totally hooked on this game!
2369	B: good. where shall we meet?
2370	A: well, actually, i don't mind eating carrots, but chocolate cakes are much better. you know i was born with a sweet tooth.
2371	B: yes, please. thank you for everything.
2372	B: yes, i'm used to being on my own.
2373	B: thank you. i will need a cashier' s check or cash, please.
2374	A: no, you don't need to pay anything on top. we just simply deduct the discounting interest.
2375	B: that' s enough for you to worship the ground she treats on.
2376	A: i am not blind. anyone can see that with half an eye.
2377	A: yes, sir. i'll get them for you right away. would you please sign this bill first? thank you, sir.
2378	B: of course. let's go.
2379	B: yes, it is.but it's nice in spring and fall.
2380	A: that' s ok, keep going, you' re moving ahead by leaps and bounds. watch your dynamics! keep your elbows lifted. remember to stroke the keys, don' t pound. that' s better! remember that as a pianist or any other musician, your technique will be what separates you from the pack just as much or more so as your musicianship.
2381	B: ah! not on me! ow!
2382	B: yes, it' s reasonably fast but it certainly isn' t cheap. fares have gone up25%.
2383	B: sorry, i'm very near sighted.
2384	A: you'll see next week. i'll come by one day at lunchtime.
2385	B: i will think about it.
2386	B: that is to say, most it professionals can get a pay rise more easily by changing a job than waiting for a rise. i'm wondering why it companies are always willing to pay more to new employees instead
2387	B: sure. the fitting room is in the corner.
2388	A: good idea. i' d be very happy to go there.
2389	B: it' s hard to say.just so-so.
2390	A: sure, no matter what happened, they should wait to discuss in their office and find the solution in a positive way.
2391	B: yes. i regard instructor as a decent occupation and i love to be an instructor.
2392	B: bye.
2393	A: thank you.
2394	B: thank you. it has always been my dream to be a stewardess.
2395	B: so get prepared for everything.
2396	A: thanks.
2397	A: good idea.
2398	B: yes, coffee, please.
2399	B: it's not my fault.
2400	B: yeah, and they also take the blame, that's what happened to my old boss ...
2401	A: our selection of stereo systems with turntables is somewhat limited, but we do have this system over here.
2402	B: it's no trouble at all. i'll carry this suitcase for you.
2403	B: thank you.
2404	B: my title was project manager. there were almost 100 people under my supervision.
2405	A: thank you.
2406	B: fine. let' s meet this afternoon. i' ll draw you a better picture of the situation.
2407	B: i just told you, debbie. i tried to call you twenty times!
2408	B: ok. i'll keep my promise.
2409	B: it's pretty simple, iris. just keep it in mind that you're what you eat.
2410	A: that' s a great idea. i' ll search for some information on the internet. if it' s possible to do, the internet will have some information about it.
2411	A: you are welcome!
2412	B: you have no idea how proud i am of myself.
2413	A: see you.
2414	A: ok.
2415	A: i wish she wouldn' t regret for her decision.
2416	A: let me have a look at the receipt.
2417	B: mr.smith has changed his job.
2418	A: hurry up, sam. the kettle' s boiling.
2419	B: i hope you haven' t invited any vegetarians.
2420	A: i will. thanks a lot.
2421	A: let's go quickly.
2422	B: no â that' s all right. how about the 30th at 4:00 p. m.? â is an hour enough?
2423	B: i'm afraid i'll be late.
2424	B: yeah, i'll call her later to patch things up.
2425	B: you forgot all of about it, didn't you?
2426	B: hope to see you again. we will provide the best service.
2427	B: that's ok with me.
2428	B: forget it. good luck. i hope you can make it.
2429	A: ok. here are the ones, turtleneck pullover, crewneck pullover, v-neck pullover and cowl-neck pullover.
2430	B: just plug in a peripheral cd or floppy drive and you're ready to go!
2431	B: of course. cigarettes are also taxed very heavily.
2432	A: good night. see you tomorrow.
2433	B: so are copernicus and many others.
2434	B: sorry, we can' t come down any more.
2435	B: yes. it could happen.
2436	A: we wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space. another reason is, we can afford to buy a home here, but we can' t in chicago!
2437	B: no, but someone said he was in the men's room puking. follow me!
2438	B: sounds perfect. i think with all that you have in mind, you'll become a successful businessman. by then, perhaps, i'll join in as a partner of your company.
2439	B: coke please. oh, no, a cup of hot chocolate will be fine.
2440	B: thank you very much. i will devote all my efforts to my work.
2441	B: well, i think i'll take the bus this time just for a change.
2442	B: you' re welcome.
2443	B: now that i have an idea of what you want, i can begin my search.
2444	A: that is good, it should speed things up nicely.
2445	B: many thanks for your presence.
2446	A: sorry, i couldn' t help you.
2447	A: thank you.
2448	B: good night!
2449	A: sure, let' s just be friends.
2450	B: well, you should be sorry! don' t ever use my computer again! you can' t do anything now, it' s too late!
2451	B: i am glad i did not drive a car.
2452	B: that' s wonderful! you must be really proud of him!
2453	A: exactly. but later on, he cares more about his career than love. work seems to be the better all, and all for him-so much that he doesn't even grudge sparing a day out with me.
2454	A: yes, here it is. that's received and cleared, so it's available for withdrawal.
2455	B: i' m glad to hear that you finally found an apartment.
2456	B: by hand in cold water. got it.
2457	B: yes. it's a korea company and it was built in beijing five years ago.
2458	A: oh, boy. his wife can' t be happy about that.
2459	B: i'm going to do that as soon as possible.
2460	B: see you.
2461	A: i would like to have notice of that question, i will give you an answer in a week.
2462	A: yeah, we should have more roads built.
2463	B: just don't stay out too late.
2464	B: you are right. let's buy the cheaper one.
2465	A: oh, that's pitiful.
2466	B: yes. some other time perhaps.thanks again.
2467	B: no, there's no charge for those.
2468	B: sure, i'll be back in a minute.
2469	B: i prefer it to working independently. i think most people do.
2470	B: exactly.
2471	B: just a club soda for me, please.
2472	B: i'll be sure to do that.
2473	A: i see.so this is your hometown?
2474	B: ok, i'll take it.
2475	A: trust me, regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs.
2476	B: i passed college english test band - 4, with good skill in listening, speaking, reading and writing. i haven't got any certificate of computer skills, because i don' t think certificates are necessary if what's needed is merely operating a computer. i think, to know how to use a computer is more important. and i'm quite familiar with microsoft office
2477	A: oh, i don't think i will buy a used sofa even it looks so attractive.
2478	B: partly, and he's also a hard working man.
2479	A: thank you very much.
2480	B: no, i'm afraid not now. i'm too busy.
2481	B: no. africans and african-americans are different in many ways. our food's different, too.
2482	A: ok. people decorate their houses, place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together.
2483	B: there is a long list of those things forbidden, including explosives, gum opium and precious cultural relies and so on.
2484	A: that's perfect! can you say that again and record it for me?
2485	A: yes, he was. i imagine he must be very angry with himself for that.
2486	B: maybe we could work out an overtime schedule. it' s definitely worth it to finish by the twentieth.
2487	A: yeah, sure. your total is seventy-eight dollars and thirty-three cents. here is your receipt. have a nice day.
2488	B: it's a pleasure.
2489	B: i'm terribly sorry i can't go with you. shall we find some other time?
2490	B: thanks.
2491	A: why not? we should do it. because now we can afford it.
2492	A: no, you don' t have to. here comes the train.
2493	B: you're right. i'll take them all.
2494	B: their family is very similar to cindy and ron' s family.
2495	B: tsinghua university.
2496	A: bye!
2497	B: yes, but with our sense we'll always look good.
2498	A: you're welcome.bye.
2499	B: i live at no. 50 xingu street.
2500	A: that's what friends are for.
2501	B: you should always remember that one customer on file is the rule.
2502	A: no wonder it's so expensive.
2503	B: you've got to let her know. come on! you've got to take a chance!
2504	B: fine.we we'll send it to you right now.
2505	B: yes, i have. but i have to wait.
2506	B: it'll begin at nine o'clock sharp.
2507	B: yes, let me put it on the calendar.
2508	B: you have a talent. you just don't know what it is yet.
2509	B: no, don' t bother. it' s all right as it is.
2510	B: you must have confidence in yourself.
2511	A: ah, you changed so fast.
2512	A: sure. it's the latest.
2513	A: thank you. maybe i will do business through internet in the future.
2514	B: it's nice of you to say so.
2515	B: you're lucky!
2516	A: goodbye.
2517	B: fine, see you then.
2518	A: no, i don' t really like it. it' s boring.
2519	B: but it's none of our business.
2520	A: people think it's funny.
2521	A: i didn' t say that either. i was hoping we could discuss the matter together. i want your advice but i don' t want you to tell me what to do. i' ve got to make decisions for myself, dad.
2522	A: the more the world becomes open, the more people become international!
2523	A: then you call me or tom first.
2524	A: fantastic.
2525	A: yes, i see.
2526	A: if the new girl is competent, maybe they will promote her when that time comes.
2527	B: no problem. let's check the terms of contract.
2528	B: well, i am not going to flog a dead horse. let get down to our brass tasks and tidy these things up.
2529	A: hopeful! thank you.
2530	B: maybe he's gifted in that.
2531	B: unless they're united, very little ...
2532	A: supper!
2533	B: no, thank you.
2534	B: sure. here you are.
2535	A: keep in touch.
2536	B: i am going to contact the sellers immediately. they were looking forward to your acceptance.
2537	A: we usually tell each other where we are with various clients and potential clients. the boss assigns extra duties to people who she thinks can best deal with them. it' s also a chance to put forward suggestions and ideas. be sure to speak up if you have any.
2538	B: i guess i can do that.
2539	B: that's right. we've been dating since last september.
2540	A: okay, but you are going to be my masterpiece!
2541	B: thanks.
2542	B: i can always use my key to get in, but i would prefer that you be there.
2543	B: it's very nice of you. i'll try my best to do my job well.
2544	A: he's really cute. his bowl even has his name on it.
2545	A: moreover, it's easy to clean, right? you are really lazy.
2546	B: sounds painful!
2547	B: they're always asking me to come home, but i think our relationship is better if we keep a distance from each other. whenever we see each other, all we do is fight.
2548	B: don't worry. the pilot knows what he's doing.
2549	B: i' m glad you understand.
2550	A: you' re right.
2551	A: yes, ten days.
2552	A: okay, it sounds good.
2553	B: ok. you drive and do be careful.
2554	B: certainly, ma' am. just take these stairs down to the first floor and turn left. you can' t miss it.
2555	B: you will receive a notice for a phone interview, which will continue the process.
2556	B: do not mention it.
2557	B: did you know it takes two to tango?
2558	B: it is so kind of you, dad.
2559	B: you are welcome. please feel free to ask if you have any more questions.
2560	B: you' re welcome. bye.
2561	B: that is easy. you can go directly to tai'an city and buy a ticket to mount tai.
2562	B: that will be great.
2563	A: that' s true. there' s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. music can influence a person' s feeling and character.
2564	B: just let it be. her rudeness will come back to haunt her.
2565	B: as a matter of fact, he is.
2566	A: that's all.thank you.
2567	B: thanks. i know things are going to be better.
2568	B: ok.
2569	B: don't worry about that, dave. look, i have to see vince now. think about what i said.
2570	B: i don't mind the work. i think it's worthwhile.
2571	A: yes, but please check in at least one hour before departure time.
2572	B: thanks!
2573	A: who knows! that might come to later.
2574	B: and would you like salad? the salad plate today is lettuce, tomatoes, and black olives.
2575	B: as long as i don' t have to row.
2576	A: i see. please prepare my bill and i will be right down to pay it.
2577	B: it is a color tv. you know, the rich people like the digital one now. so they have no room for them.
2578	A: that's wonderful. i will see the old faithful for myself.
2579	B: thank you, mr. parker.
2580	B: well, thanks, bill. let me know what happens. that extra money will really come in handy.
2581	A: thanks a lot.
2582	A: i see. thank you.
2583	A: well, it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself.
2584	B: that sounds great!
2585	B: thank you. hopefully i won't have to call about him again.
2586	B: thanks.
2587	B: thanks for calling, blanca. i'll see you tomorrow.
2588	A: can i have some cookies first, please?
2589	B: psychology.
2590	B: i suppose so. that's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in china now.
2591	A: i think i will. thanks for the info.
2592	B: really? quite a woman, isn' t she?
2593	B: better not forget that, so kill you if you don't get her something.
2594	B: keep it and use it as rag. you can clean your bicycle with it.
2595	B: i think i just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways.
2596	B: you have to tell them if you were too sick to work on any of the days that you should have been looking for work.
2597	B: can i have a black one over there?
2598	B: exactly.
2599	B: let's get it back.
2600	B: adding in your expenses, i calculate that you can spend three hundred thousand on a house.
2601	B: yes. and i took many pictures.
2602	B: of course.you look terrific in it!
2603	B: in that case, here, you go first.
2604	B: ok. here you are.
2605	B: yes, simple as it is. t does work.
2606	B: what?
2607	A: have a nice day and thanks you for calling dutton hotels.
2608	B: ok. i'd like to say that i've really enjoyed working with you. however, i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay.
2609	A: not really, i am familiar with this area.
2610	B: you're right, sir. please let me transfer you to my supervisor
2611	A: ah, well, we have no choice.
2612	B: exactly. with del you don't have that problem.
2613	A: i always am. you just didn't notice.
2614	B: that's a bad habit.
2615	B: yeah, it sure would.
2616	A: very good. now, if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.
2617	A: well, i can't hear you.
2618	A: everything appears to be in order. thank you for your time.
2619	B: i'd like to, but i'm not sure if i'll have enough money.
2620	B: bye.
2621	B: that would be wonderful. thank you so much for all of your help.
2622	B: i feel i really stupid.
2623	B: well, ping-pong is our national sport, and we just have to keep winning one honor after another. that's why many people think such rules acceptable. after all, they are funded out of taxpayers'money.
2624	A: half an hours later.
2625	B: you, too.
2626	B: that will be fine.
2627	B: that is cheating and, if you get caught, you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment.
2628	B: remember that you are in college now, not high school.
2629	B: and the bank will offer you loans for twenty years!
2630	A: no, thank you. please tell him to phone me when he comes back.
2631	B: your entire test history is on the site. you can compare your results from other years.
2632	A: i will take your advice.
2633	B: oh, dear! i'll do whatever i can.
2634	B: oh, i see. well, i don't plan on only paying the minimum, but it's good to know that i can if i had to. thanks for that.
2635	B: yes. mostly to england and france.
2636	A: i guess i'll have to buy a new alarm clock.
2637	B: a brand new taxi is pulling up now.
2638	B: i think you will enjoy your journey.
2639	B: ah, canberra is the capital city. but is not the biggest city. sydney is the biggest city. canberra was made sort of by the politicians so sydney wouldn't get to crowded. it's a separate territory.
2640	A: but the poll says only 15 percent say he will be remembered as an outstanding president.
2641	A: well, i ... anyways, i was just thinking of the red envelopes. i wanna make a list of all the things i' m gonna buy with my red envelope money! i can' t wait! i' m gonna have so much money! mom, can i get a pen and a piece of paper? i want a new transformer, no, two transformers ... the optimums prime, and ... maybe the wheeljack? i' ll get a psp game, ahahah, and i' ll buy the entire class lunch at macdonald' s ...
2642	B: let me go get it for you.
2643	A: you've take the words out of my mouth.
2644	A: don't mention it. good luck. you're going to need it.
2645	B: sure.
2646	B: that's all right.
2647	B: do it, please.
2648	B: i think so. we certainly don' t want a highjack to happen on our plane today.
2649	A: good preparation will improve the effectiveness of the meeting. i am sure that your hard work will pay off.
2650	A: that sounds like fun. have a good time.
2651	B: yes. we need to put the money into long-term projects rather than wasting it on short-term ones.
2652	B: ok.there are four persons in my family, my parents, my elder sister and me.
2653	B: yes, indeed, people say he's the smartest young man.
2654	B: thanks, i' ll give them a call later.
2655	A: ok, no problem. but you have to learn it and then do it yourself next time.
2656	B: oh, sorry! i forgot you get queasy with the sight of blood. i'll be right there.
2657	A: that's very kind of you.
2658	A: he's very handsome, i think.
2659	B: come on, brenda! never say die.
2660	A: thank you. here' s your change and receipt.
2661	A: i know. if a policeman catches you using the cell phone while driving, you will be fined.
2662	B: i usually meet some friends and we play sports together or i might spend some time alone on my hobbies. i spend winter evening watching tv, but i spend summer evening at cultural events if i have time
2663	B: thank you.
2664	B: sure. thanks.
2665	A: i wish i could stay longer, but i must be going.
2666	A: thank you.
2667	B: ok, mum. i'll invite my friends home.
2668	B: i can't help it.
2669	B: thank you, and have a nice day.
2670	B: i hope you enjoy your dinner.
2671	A: but one must have some basic ideas about nutrition and find the best way for it to work out for the body.
2672	B: i'd be glad to. he's really cute.
2673	B: you know, you're right. maybe you should get a dog.
2674	B: the stock exchange where i worked was too small my further promotion was impossible. i am able of more responsibilities, so i decided to leave.
2675	B: i' ve been to other scandinavian countries, but not to norway. perhaps i should go and do some winter sports there.
2676	A: yes, just a moment, please.
2677	B: $ 50 a day.
2678	B: fine.we ' ll be expecting you.
2679	A: i'm fine for now, thanks.
2680	A: you've got it! but are we coming back for the music, or for the fruit ?!
2681	B: so what? his father is in prison, not he.
2682	B: yes. it will keep your face from getting dry and make your skin soft.
2683	A: sure. just let us know before your lease expires.
2684	B: no, i just read the names off the packages ... ha!
2685	B: honey, it's good if you spend money to buy more books. but $ 100 dollars a week is enough for you already.
2686	B: aha, aha ...
2687	B: i will pay with cash.
2688	A: then we will come here for lunch tomorrow.
2689	A: nice to meet you too.
2690	B: it's at the back. i think you are near-sighted. you had better get yourself a pair of nice glasses.
2691	B: yes. no need to change.
2692	B: no, but we went to the kennedy center.
2693	A: no. i borrowed it to go shopping.
2694	A: oh. i' m sorry to hear that. what happened?
2695	B: well that's great! it's nice that we have something in common.
2696	A: well, we offer a 10% charge for our members.
2697	A: thanks. i will ask him.
2698	B: nice meeting you, too. good-bye.
2699	A: yes. please help me reserve it.
2700	B: no, thank you. i'll take an aspirin and see how it goes.
2701	A: ok, we would do as your requirement. and we' ll contact with you later!
2702	A: thank you very much.
2703	B: sure. meet me at five.
2704	B: thank you for you help.
2705	B: indeed.he ' s strict with himself too.
2706	B: well done!
2707	A: have a nice day, bye!
2708	B: that' s it for today. thank you.
2709	A: yes, there is one at 8: 30 a. m. that arrives at 11:35 a. m.
2710	B: let me have a look. oh, no. they are chinese poems which describe this happy scene.
2711	B: well, i guess if you are sigrid and roy you can keep a tiger or lion. i guess all types of things don't they.
2712	A: ok, let's go and ask.
2713	A: what ever you say?
2714	B: in particular, i'm interested in marketing in the domestic field.
2715	B: why don't you go over the resumes again? they might help you decide who to hire.
2716	A: we wanted to live in a more peaceful community and have more space. another reason is, we can afford to buy a home here, but we can' t in chicago!
2717	B: my wife, my daughter and i.
2718	B: let' s go then.
2719	B: well, these mediums are still important ... they aren't a thing of the past ... but i think they might be less important now than in the past. the technology age has arrived!
2720	B: oh, that's great! thank you.
2721	B: why not have a visit to the zoo?
2722	B: you're welcome.
2723	B: you can't beat that.
2724	A: right.
2725	A: thank you. i have got quite clear idea of it.
2726	B: well, if there is anything i can do to help, let me know.
2727	A: see, now something good has happened to you on a bus trip!
2728	B: see you later.
2729	A: it doesn't seem quite interesting. would you change the channel?
2730	A: a goal!
2731	B: call me tomorrow, and we'll get started.
2732	B: i guarantee you that our little "friends" won't be back. i hope your trip home is pleasant.
2733	A: well, i also have ...
2734	B: try it and if you can't do it, one of us can always help you later.
2735	A: good night.
2736	A: i'll have that too.
2737	B: well, it's straight, but it's upside down i'm afraid.
2738	A: no, i'll discuss the business with him at hotel.
2739	A: alright. and i won't go to that cafe for awhile.
2740	A: i went to a boxing match in the sports stadium.
2741	A: thanks for the invitation. i will!
2742	A: see you tonight.
2743	A: see you tomorrow.
2744	B: bye.
2745	B: sure, madam. i' ll remind you.
2746	B: now you're talking.
2747	A: yes, but he' s got a wife and 3 children as well.
2748	A: well, i've always wanted to see vancouver. i've heard it has the most beautiful views.
2749	A: wait for a moment, i'll come back soon.
2750	A: great. thanks for you advice!
2751	B: you're welcome, have a safe trip.
2752	B: thank you, have a good day.
2753	A: twelve.he ' s very sensible for his age.
2754	B: you are a quick learner. i don't think you'll have any trouble with this.
2755	B: when i was your age, my parents didn' t have central heating like you do! we had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it. we used it to cook, heat the house and even dry our clothes! we never caught a cold. you should be grateful!
2756	A: ok, thanks a lot. see you then.
2757	A: you really can't live without candy.
2758	A: it means ' telegraphic transfer '. so, if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere, to anywhere in the world.
2759	B: i' ve been busy, hilary. we can set up a meeting to talk about the deal, but i still feel the same way. i don' t think it' s worth it.
2760	B: that's fine.
2761	B: i can hardly believe it.
2762	B: right away, sir. she will be impressed with your local knowledge.
2763	B: that would be great. thanks.
2764	B: okay. but be prepared for an all-nighter! i doubt you will want to put it down either.
2765	A: i don't know. my wife used to speak french. i must tell her to brush it up.
2766	A: i' ve had a lot worse problems than this traveling so it' s really no big deal.
2767	B: okay, i'll make you some food.
2768	A: maybe.
2769	B: it was not in the past. but from 2008, we can enjoy a three-day holiday for this festival.
2770	B: one economy, please.
2771	B: i am sure we will.
2772	A: you said it.
2773	B: and you'd better not cry or you'll have black streaks running down your face.
2774	B: it's a pleasure.
2775	A: yeah, but he really puts blame on me.
2776	B: perrier, jim beam, apples, and grape juice. it will all be there shortly, sir.
2777	A: i'm still not sure whether i can recover from it.
2778	A: so i don't think you'll have a problem finding another girlfriend. there are plenty of fish in the sea!
2779	B: no, thanks. i'd like to go straight home. i'm very tired.
2780	B: you're welcome.
2781	B: no, i am from france.
2782	B: you're welcome.
2783	A: thank you. i am glad we have come to an agreement at last.
2784	B: this pair fits me perfectly. i feel comfortable.
2785	B: well, i' ll think about it. i don' t know whether accounting is going to agree to such a big purchase.
2786	A: fine! i want a divorce!
2787	A: that'd be great. i'll see you then!
2788	A: thank you for your delicious meal.
2789	B: toss a coin to decide then.
2790	B: i got the short end of the stick.
2791	A: thanks.
2792	B: it's already half past four. we should go and pay our respects. taylor's family will be there.
2793	B: that' s all right.
2794	B: yes, of course. in accounting, cash means all items that are acceptable for depositing in a bank.
2795	A: wait a moment.
2796	B: she' s a consummate professional and a team-player. i have utmost confidence in her abilities. you can' t go wrong in hiring her.
2797	A: it might be.
2798	A: in the front, please.
2799	B: yogurt, because it has protein, vitamins and it is acidic. if you drink it everyday, your stomach will be more comfortable.
2800	A: this is a pity!
2801	A: 500 yuan. and if you buy it today, there will be a 15% discount for you.
2802	B: that is fine.
2803	B: really? thank you.
2804	B: oh, yes. just show me where the fitting rooms are now. i can't wait to try this on.
2805	B: i'll just go and check for you.
2806	B: about fifteen hours.
2807	B: you're right ... i should eat something. let's go.
2808	A: i see.
2809	B: he is a dishonest man and always tells a cock and bull story.
2810	B: really? that is amazing.
2811	B: well-endowed? don't worry. i have some bras with bigger cup sizes in the back.
2812	B: because orange is much more to my taste.
2813	B: i think that i might be getting the flu.
2814	B: no, it's free.
2815	B: great! i'm having a great time.
2816	B: you might not believe this, but i used to be twice the size than i am now!
2817	A: indeed, they are. keeping staff happy is the only way to keep them with the company.
2818	A: i've got to catch the last bus. see you later.
2819	A: thank you very much. i am sure good rest will do indeed. i don' t have this too often.
2820	B: come on. i stand behind you.
2821	B: i am going to post all of that information on the geology club web page. check it out when you get a chance. see you monday!
2822	B: oh, we' d like the buffet please. we' ve heard it' s very good.
2823	B: i will do my best.
2824	B: i' m so sorry that i have got to go. i have a business appointment right now.
2825	B: yeah, i think so.
2826	B: coco lee.
2827	B: but you don't have such a problem as to pop songs.
2828	A: i remember now. your advice is very helpful.
2829	B: that's disappointing. i was really looking forward to it.
2830	A: well, as we say, the rest is history ...
2831	A: you fiend. it's about the flavor, not the fix. why don't you just crush some caffeine pills and start doing lines?
2832	B: ha, ha! those days are long gone.
2833	A: of course
2834	A: it' s too bad i did all that shopping yesterday!
2835	B: thank you.
2836	A: alright. and i won't go to that cafe for awhile.
2837	B: yes. you are expected to know the e-mail address of the company.
2838	B: let's hope for good cooperation between us.
2839	A: give her up.
2840	B: you can keep the cat, but you should keep it away from me.
2841	B: please call if you have any other requests. your food will be delivered promptly.
2842	A: you are very welcome.
2843	B: i see. all right, then. thanks.
2844	B: your quantity sold is beyond the required by more than 30%.
2845	B: i will be there after 20 minutes.
2846	B: yes, i have studied in an english training program and a computer training program since i graduated from university. i am currently studying finance at a training school.
2847	B: but now i would stay at home watching tv.
2848	A: ok, i get it! ! thank you for your very thorough analysis!
2849	B: que bien! sentences poems habeas en espanol!
2850	A: it' s about time.
2851	B: no, thanks. i'd like to go straight home. i'm very tired.
2852	B: thank you. good night.
2853	B: that' s not a bad idea. i brought many plenty of books and things back with me last summer. that would be great resource material. now if i can only remember where i put them.
2854	B: oh, you have too wild of an imagination.
2855	B: i guess we'll either make it, or we won't.
2856	B: it's not only the name of our company that will change ... i expect that after this acquisition, there'll be a ton of things up in the air.
2857	B: don't worry, we'll find someone eventually!
2858	A: pretty good.thank you.
2859	B: not at all, but we don' t have a very traditional marriage either, so it suited us perfectly!
2860	A: billy ...
2861	A: let' s move the sofa. can you get a grip on the bottom at that end? i' ll lift this end. i want to move it sideways in that direction.
2862	A: in this aspect, i think, pater bags have the edge on plastic bags.
2863	B: she'd better keep away from them.
2864	A: well, considering your qualifications, we believe you would be a suitable candidate.
2865	B: i'm getting by ok. i heard micropower was going to make zina president of their new invoking internet division.
2866	B: when can i wear perfume?
2867	B: thank you. i appreciate the compliment.
2868	B: yes, starting salary is 6,000 yuan a month plus bonuses.
2869	A: well. i think i will wait.
2870	B: the main one is radiation. there are two sorts of radiation man must fear in space. the first is radiation from the sun, and this is particularly dangerous when the sun is very active and explosions are occurring on its surface. the second, less harmful, comes from the so-called van allen belts.
2871	A: hope so!
2872	B: he is out of luck.
2873	B: of course.
2874	A: i guess i'd buy that ...
2875	B: thank you. have a nice day.
2876	B: she is our new project manager. she starts next week.
2877	B: not funny.
2878	B: good for you, leslie!
2879	B: it's great!
2880	B: thank you.
2881	A: this is interesting, ms.parker.
2882	A: you're so industrious.
2883	B: yes, you do.
2884	B: you're telling me.
2885	B: just having a chat.
2886	A: that's a good idea. i'll call them now. thanks for your help!
2887	A: maybe that's why he's so nice!
2888	A: not too bad.
2889	A: let's give it a shot!
2890	B: i think the most important thing is the nature of the job. one should never do anything one is not interested in. to me, pleasant working conditions with co-operative staff are also important.
2891	B: i'm sorry to hear that.
2892	A: oh, my god! he' s so perfect.
2893	B: because i don' t think my husband would like it. thank you for inviting me anyway.
2894	B: all right. please wait for a minute.
2895	A: quite satisfied. i'm looking forward to our future cooperation.
2896	B: but we can't destroy our forests to get the wood.
2897	A: i'll keep that in mind.
2898	B: i would look so cool carrying this around!
2899	B: no, not at all. glad to have you.
2900	B: ho, no!
2901	B: it is said that the cowherd and the spinster, the lover stars in heaven, can only meet on the seventh eve, so this day has become the lover's day.
2902	B: i think that i have something else really important to do on that day. i just can' t remember what it is.
2903	A: not at all. you'll be ok soon.
2904	B: the company will assign you housing subsidies at 400 yuan a month.
2905	B: wow! that car almost hit me.
2906	A: that' s a pity. we can arrange another time hopefully.
2907	B: well, the worst of the winter should be over.
2908	A: ok, i'll call ahead.
2909	B: ... yes, but this one has an all-new buzz.
2910	B: i hope that i cleared things up for you.
2911	B: yes.
2912	B: good for you, keep it up.
2913	B: anthony, you were caught making international calls from the office phone, you called in sick in eight times this month and you smell like alcohol!
2914	B: just a minute. here's your change.
2915	A: i am sorry, we will change yours for a new one.
2916	B: okay. i guess i could give it a try.
2917	B: that's fine, because if i leave, then your rules won't matter.
2918	A: very well sir, welcome to the united states, enjoy your visit.
2919	B: yes. i will.
2920	B: it's my dream.
2921	B: mr. morris was so pleased with your sales work on his account that he went straight to the top with it. he wrote a letter about it to mr. macmillan!
2922	B: that's really convenient.
2923	A: i think you' re right!
2924	B: not far away.it ' s over there.
2925	B: yes, i'm serious this time.
2926	A: you can send a compressed one.
2927	A: yes, prompt and careful filing contributes greatly to the efficiency of our office.
2928	B: because bicycles are safer.
2929	B: i'm from canada.
2930	B: yes, but i don't like the story.
2931	B: i have to support my parents who are advanced in age, so i'd like to commence at had 2,500 a month.
2932	A: don't worry about it. i've got another one i can use.
2933	B: it' s all my faults. i forget where i put it.
2934	B: got it.
2935	B: i see. but i'm busy now. how about tomorrow?
2936	B: good idea.
2937	B: no, i haven' t discussed my career plan with my present employer, but i am sure he will understand.
2938	B: thank you.
2939	B: well, take care of yourself, and don't say i didn't warn you.
2940	A: ha, well, we have no choice.
2941	A: thank you.
2942	B: i'll get it for you right now.
2943	B: ok.
2944	A: kristy, that's wonderful! thanks so much for contacting me personally.
2945	B: that's perfect. i will definitely do well.
2946	B: but he is always talking big.
2947	B: where is my wallet? someone has stolen my wallet!
2948	B: needless to say, as a westerner, it's bread.
2949	B: let' s take a few pictures so that we can remember what we like about this home.
2950	B: that' s fine, as long as you can get that report typed up before you leave.
2951	B: good!
2952	B: ok! we'll definitely go to visit your company.
2953	A: yes, we do, madam. thank you, madam. here' s our welcome brochure with all of information of our facilities. my name is john. if you need any help do let me know. i' m at your service.
2954	A: the place is ok.let ' s go there and have a look at it again.
2955	B: yes, we do deliveries for orders over $ 15, ma' am.
2956	B: that's great. this is your key, sir. if you need anything at all, anytime, just dial zero.
2957	B: good that he resembled his old, quick self.
2958	B: many thanks for your present. i'm so glad you are able to come.
2959	B: a capricorn is serious-minded and practical. she likes to do things in conventional ways. that sounds just like you!
2960	A: thank you.
2961	B: yes, please.
2962	B: ok, goodbye.
2963	B: that's an attractive plan. i'll think about it.
2964	B: i would like that. thank you.
2965	B: yeah, i really know the feeling. i can' t wait to graduate so i can get a good job and earn my own money.
2966	B: sure. come on in.
2967	B: to maintain a high standard of nursing, we should take experience and education into consideration while considering a nurse's level of expertise in caring for various patients.
2968	B: last time i tried a pin curl perm and a foam permanent. set the wave a little looser than usual, please.
2969	B: who's your manager? tell me! would you?
2970	A: the heroin may not be attractive. i like the story, though.
2971	B: well, i work very long hours, ten hours a day is quite normal. and if something important comes up, i' m often in the office until 8 or 9 in the evening.
2972	B: oh, no!
2973	B: ok. thanks for that!
2974	A: are you kidding me? becky? she' s a real bitch.
2975	B: well, i heard that if you drink enough beer, you can speak foreign languages better ...
2976	A: i have a master's degree and i meet all the needs you want, so i am confident of doing this job well.
2977	A: well, say hello to him for me.
2978	A: then you must be off your head. he is a real bastard.
2979	B: i'm not sure, you know i'm not familiar with the city, too.
2980	B: i won't tell you, unless you promise to let me watch it with you.
2981	B: you' re welcome.
2982	B: hands, when one is not actually eating, may be in the lap. tipping one's chair is unforgivable.
2983	B: that's okay.
2984	B: oh, i think shanghai is much more crowded than london.
2985	B: that's very good advice!
2986	B: ok with me. you are the boss. i will meet you downstairs after work.
2987	B: it's just too bad. i have to leave it as it is, and thank you just the same.
2988	B: yes, they have a good reputation for fairness.
2989	B: we can pig out on potato chips and cookies. they are very cheap.
2990	B: hey! the movie hasn't even started and they're almost gone!
2991	B: it involves a lot of travel.
2992	B: come on, nancy. play it cool. i go with you and burn the middle night oil tonight.
2993	B: you know, i like traveling. i made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself.
2994	B: you won't have to pay for anything.
2995	A: i hope so.
2996	B: now that's a plus!
2997	B: why not?
2998	B: that sounds like a good idea. i'll have to try that.
2999	B: everything is okay. and as soon as i see my son at home, all my worries vanish into the blue.
3000	A: okay, okay, we'll split it 50/50.
3001	B: that's absolutely ridiculous!
3002	B: easier said than done.
3003	B: i don' t try to go ahead of people and lead them, i' d rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together.
3004	B: that' s great. thanks a lot.
3005	B: i think americans are pretty romantic when they are in a relationship and a lot of flirting goes on in every office. after you' ve been in america for a while, you will probably see what i mean.
3006	B: here. we have black, white and transparent panty-hose here.
3007	B: i am all set. he can come anytime.
3008	A: don' t worry, i can handle that. and i know if the boss is there, even it is an informal evening, it does not make a good impression to get totally drunk in front of him.
3009	A: you're right, sarah. i was a fool. i can't believe it. how could i fall for such a trick?
3010	B: as the saying goes, when in rome, do as the romans do.
3011	B: if only he knew it.
3012	B: don't worry, it's not serious. you will get better soon.
3013	A: ok. i'll take it.
3014	A: thanks john, and there you have it! looks like it' s a weekend to stay at home!
3015	A: thank you very much.
3016	A: sorry!
3017	B: here's your change. thank you for shopping with us.
3018	A: oh, lots of things. mostly training new people.
3019	B: see you.
3020	B: thanks! i'm so happy. it's like a dream come true.
3021	B: that's right.
3022	B: alright, alright. how did you cut this so bad?
3023	B: sorry, not tonight!
3024	B: not at all.
3025	B: that's better. i like travelling.
3026	B: why not?
3027	A: david, stop dreaming. it' s time to do your homework.
3028	A: i think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends, and then the right person will come along.
3029	B: i think i'll stick with a more traditional choice today!
3030	B: washing clothes at a laundromat costs a lot less money.
3031	A: boy, this sure doesn't help us much. it could be anybody. how about his cloth? what was he wearing?
3032	B: no! the egg came first!
3033	B: yeah. thanks. and have fun!
3034	A: no, i'll pay for it in cash.
3035	B: ok.
3036	A: no. he has no idea what a fat little pig i was!
3037	B: yes, it is.
3038	B: ok.
3039	B: to a disco? oh, no. you know i hate it.
3040	B: that's convenient.thank you.
3041	B: oh, i think she wants to do this thing in memory of her father.
3042	B: ok, i' ll try my best.
3043	A: there. stop!
3044	B: bye.
3045	A: dude, don' t equivocate. a theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. you slept through class, didn' t you?
3046	B: forget it. i don't want to inflict any more pain on myself. in a little while i'll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.
3047	B: i'm not sure.
3048	A: ok, i'll begin the opening procedure now and we'll let you know when everything is sorted.
3049	A: he told me so himself.
3050	B: well, how do i put this? france is a terrible team.
3051	B: all right, but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon? we're very busy just now as you can see, sir.
3052	A: take it easy. be confident of yourself. i'm sure you can do it.
3053	A: here is the money.
3054	B: well, you certainly didn' t choose her because of her looks! hey, i was joking! don' t hit me!
3055	B: nothing of the sort. i can't hold a candle to her.
3056	A: good idea! well, joan, i have something important to tell you.
3057	A: you bet it.
3058	B: i'll be there.
3059	B: i'll just get a regular home computer then. i don't think i'll need to lug my computer around with me.
3060	B: thank you.
3061	A: great. then call me and let me know if she's free.
3062	B: that' s more than my round-trip ticket!
3063	B: soup always makes me feel better when i'm sick. i hope it makes you feel better, too.
3064	B: it doesn't matter, i will take an aisle seat.
3065	A: rents are very high in downtown area.
3066	B: see you. bye.
3067	A: no. but you mustn' t leave it too long. did you report it the police?
3068	A: that' s what i want to say.
3069	B: p-a-r-k-i-n-g m-e-t-e-r.
3070	A: ok. i will take it as well. how much in all?
3071	A: yes. we say "eat well and drink well ."
3072	A: you' ll be a mathematician one day.
3073	A: thanks.
3074	B: hmm ... you're right. well, i guess ' terminator ' is an exception to the rule.
3075	B: yeah! i called him after i got home to arrange our next date, but unfortunately his grandma is sick so he has been busy every night visiting her in the hospital.
3076	A: yeah, you are right!
3077	A: i totally understand.
3078	A: yeah, i need to take a break.
3079	A: speaking of the x-files, it's on right now!
3080	B: i'm sorry. i forgot to show you the lid. it comes with the pan.
3081	A: eat humble pie? impossible, i' ve never been wrong in judging boys like him.
3082	B: i' ll have to try it. you know how i am about italian food! what' s the name?
3083	B: thank you, i will be doing my best.
3084	B: many times there are special services available to certain groups like women at work or job help for non-english speakers.
3085	A: well, don' t be late. i' ll see you on friday at helen' s.
3086	B: all right. leave these ads with me. i' ll speak to him this morning.
3087	A: i'll call again in thirty minutes.
3088	B: he was too desperate to find some other way.
3089	B: all right. thanks a lot.
3090	B: i hope so.
3091	B: all right. i'll have them.
3092	B: i don't know. maybe it' s some kind of personal problem.
3093	A: you are lazy. you ought to be ashamed? you should enjoy working.
3094	B: ten kg! dear shirley must have put a lead ball in it!
3095	A: please make a detailed schedule on the visit this afternoon.
3096	A: yes, i do. thank you.
3097	B: you can wash the vegetables and cut the chicken and i'll make dinner!
3098	B: i think you're right. let's go.
3099	B: i' m sorry. but i don' t meant to get your goat.
3100	B: you're welcome.
3101	B: oh, gag me! she's totally gross!
3102	B: it won't be long until your food is delivered. i know you'll enjoy it.
3103	B: for about 3 hours. enjoy your trip.
3104	B: here you go then. have a great school year!
3105	A: here you are. take your time.
3106	B: you are in luck. the traffic is not heavy today.
3107	B: ok. i' ll try my best to calm down first.
3108	A: thanks.
3109	B: never mind. it' s just my duty.
3110	B: okay, you get your funny one and i'll get my beautiful one.
3111	B: thanks, byebye.
3112	B: she'd better keep away from them.
3113	A: i've never been to disneyland. i went to universal studios when i was fifteen. my parents took my brother franco and i to los angeles and san francisco.wish you and janet love each other more.
3114	A: yes, great. i am happy you are coming.
3115	B: yeah, why not? i've got a little free time on my hands. where do you want to eat?
3116	B: i always meet people like him.
3117	B: it's going to be 3 dollars 40 cents.
3118	A: oh, it is not so expensive. it only costs me 280 dollars.
3119	B: no, but i have database programming experience and network knowledge.
3120	B: bye.
3121	A: good idea!
3122	A: alright.
3123	B: 92.
3124	B: yeah. it's boring. i'd rather read something more exciting.
3125	A: ok.
3126	B: yes.
3127	A: they are all good.
3128	B: thanks. i really appreciate that.
3129	B: get this prescription filled and go straight to bed.
3130	B: i know. it's going to save me a lot of money, i hope.
3131	A: i think you' re right. there needs to be an international response to this problem.
3132	B: there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will, but i don't think it's going to happen any time soon.
3133	A: that sounds like an excellent offer. i might take you up on that. thank you for the wonderful invitation.
3134	B: oh, yes. marvelous!
3135	A: of course, we have.
3136	A: that's fine.
3137	A: it's none of your business. let me try them on.
3138	A: ok, i'll make sure she gets the message.
3139	A: i can predict it will have the largest circulation in one or two years.
3140	B: sure, i'll certainly help you do it.
3141	A: i knew i shouldn't have shown you my new toy ...
3142	B: that's true. and sometimes the tickets are cheaper during the week as well.
3143	B: thank you very much. bye.
3144	B: the train station is indeed crowded. i think it' s hard for us to get on the train.
3145	B: that's ok with me.
3146	B: ok. i'll take this one.
3147	B: it' s great.
3148	A: yes. i went to tinge sport centre for football match last sunday.
3149	B: of course not, i have to watch my american idol.
3150	A: just did my best.
3151	B: the movies.
3152	B: thanks.
3153	B: no. have a seat.
3154	B: but both my wife and i prefer taking a bus.
3155	A: me, too. at this time of the year, i often miss my home in the warm south.
3156	B: just so so.there are no exciting things for me.
3157	B: i' m afraid that i can' t do that. they' re at the printer' s being copied. they' ll be back tomorrow before 1 o' clock.
3158	B: actually, our new math teacher is a good person. he just can't find an appropriate way to teach us.
3159	B: the price factor can be a useful instrument for exporters when trying to place their products in industrialized countries. of course, marketing goods abroad is not only a question of price. there are also other important factors such as design, quality of goods, terms of sale, transport and insurance.
3160	B: count me out.
3161	A: sure.
3162	B: it was just over two million euros last year.
3163	A: oh, i have got it. how nice are the singers singing!
3164	B: ok. here you are.
3165	B: i will. enjoy your meeting!
3166	A: that's ok. here is the address.
3167	A: i appreciate it. it is related to company image.
3168	B: really? you worked here for just half an hour. i consider the price very high.
3169	B: thank you honey, it means a lot to me.
3170	B: thank you. your confirmation number is 611273.
3171	B: great minds think alike.
3172	B: right, i'll contact my guarantor now and we'll come in within the next couple of days. thanks very much for your help. goodbye.
3173	B: it's absolutely true in the united states that losses from pilferage have been limited to high valued goods. we must study more about packing.
3174	B: it's called love is blind, i think.
3175	B: you're very welcome.
3176	B: i believe in that. well, the performance is about to begin. let's be quiet.
3177	B: take your time. when you need anything, just call me.
3178	B: ok. let's see. give me a sheet.
3179	A: you are very lucky.
3180	B: nothing ' doing.
3181	B: that's good.
3182	B: well, if i'm not living here anymore, then i won't have to listen to your rules.
3183	B: i'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit. please have a pleasant trip home.
3184	B: credit card please. here you are.
3185	B: yes. they have been laid by their name cards on the meeting table for each attendant.
3186	B: no, i'll send a larger vehicle to pick you up.
3187	B: we appreciate your business.
3188	B: this one is the same size and color. but the design is different.
3189	B: you'd better take an umbrella.
3190	A: that' s my middle finger, nick. this is my ring finger!
3191	B: and i've never heard such good sound in a game.
3192	B: that may be true, but i'm sure you enjoyed your sandwich.
3193	B: yes, i will. i hope i'll enjoy working with you.
3194	A: yes, you must.
3195	B: fine. see you on the 18th.
3196	B: i got offered a new job!
3197	B: ok! i will try this.
3198	A: i' ve been thinking of doing that lately! i don' t want some banker to run off with my money!
3199	B: they give chocolate in return.
3200	B: yes, i'm looking for a book on chinese history.
3201	B: so confusing! in my day we got an a or b if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an f!
3202	B: oh, you're welcome.
3203	A: i don't know ... well, maybe, you're right, but how am i going to tell her?
3204	B: ok, that is reasonable. i will take it.
3205	B: well, i guess you're out of luck.
3206	A: that' s great, because it uses natural materials rather than ones that scientists make themselves. i prefer natural remedies to man-made ones.
3207	A: you are really a man who knows how to enjoy being alone.
3208	A: i'm sorry, we cannot make corrections on these. you'll have to bring another one with the correct amount, i'm afraid.
3209	B: no, thanks. that will be it.
3210	B: no, he didn't!
3211	B: yes, that's quite all right for me.
3212	A: yes, sir. that's correct.
3213	A: see you later.
3214	B: so what's the problem?
3215	A: not at all, it's reasonable.
3216	B: that's ok. we can go jogging, after we eat!
3217	B: i am willing to tell you that information.
3218	B: no, a lot of women stay home and take care of their families. but some work.
3219	B: my birthday is in june, when we are always on holiday. so my family often forgets my birthday too.
3220	A: thanks.
3221	A: playing tennis twice a week will be a good start. count me in.
3222	A: you can put on your white shoes, it fits every occasion.
3223	B: happy birthday to you! i'd really love to come, but i'm not sure right now. i'll try to make it.thank you for your invitation.
3224	B: maybe it can take effect.
3225	B: we appreciate your help.
3226	A: ok, thank you.
3227	A: it is thoughtful. i will take it.
3228	B: the disease fails to respond to drugs.
3229	A: who knows. after all, he is handsome and rich.
3230	B: thanks, ma' am. you' re a lifesaver!
3231	B: ah! not on me! ow!
3232	B: thank you.
3233	B: we work in teams. there are about four to six people in each team. i'm training to be a team leader. each team member is responsible for the quality of the goods we produce. we are multi-skilled so we can rotate jobs. i like that. it stops the work getting boring.
3234	B: because english is nothing but a tool which is used when people may negotiate in international conferences, probe into physics, release some information in a press conferrence, and do anything we can do with language. therefore, an interpreter has to know some expertise in the field he/she serves as an interpreter. otherwise he/she can not carry out his/her work smoothly.
3235	A: they want raises and medical insurance, and i think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards. that's probably the most important issue.
3236	B: let me check.
3237	B: surely of course. give me your card please.
3238	A: i would greatly appreciate that.
3239	A: thanks, mom. thanks.
3240	B: go ahead.
3241	B: i'm sure you'll have a good time.
3242	B: totally not. perhaps it's about our marriage.
3243	B: no. we'll take care of everything.
3244	B: all right. then i can do some shopping today before going back to my country.
3245	B: i see why it lags behind other towns.
3246	A: dear mom, please permit of superman's naughty.
3247	B: that' s why many people look up to him.
3248	A: ok. people decorate their houses, place a christmas tree in the room and maybe sing a christmas carol together.
3249	B: you're welcome.
3250	A: nope, i' m canceling my appointment so that i can stay here with you.
3251	B: please bring me the chicken chops.
3252	B: i've been snowed under with work since my boss was away on business.
3253	A: ok.thank you.
3254	B: yes, i'll see that she get the message when she checks in.
3255	A: i will sometime. thanks for the advice.
3256	B: i would like it with no salt, please.
3257	B: oh, i watched it on television. it was an exciting match.
3258	A: for two days.
3259	A: loretta? no, she can't come, she's busy.
3260	B: thanks. i' m proud of myself, too.
3261	B: no, that should be it. thank you!
3262	B: get some snack foods.
3263	B: all right, let me get your meat for you.
3264	A: that's incredible!
3265	A: you didn't note the damage on the bill of lading.
3266	B: very well. just take your time.
3267	B: thanks. you have a good one, too.
3268	A: hey, slow down. i'll tell you more while playing.
3269	B: yes, i see. thanks a lot.
3270	A: certainly.
3271	A: yes. shall i get one for you? just push the button over there if you need anything.
3272	B: they're not cheap, but neither is their furniture.
3273	A: sorry, madam. we don't have vacancies at the moment.
3274	A: lucky her.
3275	B: perfect. it really hits the spot.
3276	A: oh, so it was my fault, was it? if i hadn't warned you in time it would have been much worse.
3277	B: ok, no problem.
3278	B: i'll have chicken and ginger burger with chilli dressing.
3279	A: good night.
3280	B: sadly, i hardly ever speak to english people. i usually practice with my chinese friends.
3281	B: no, not for a few months.
3282	B: it's super.
3283	B: who's your manager? tell me! would you?
3284	B: oh, this is over my head. it' s too professional.
3285	B: yes, please. please print your name and company name, and the person you are going to see.
3286	A: absolutely. thanks for coming rebecca. goodbye.
3287	B: i got you. next time. i'll preface a toast with a statement like ' i can't drink any more ' and then drink anyway.
3288	B: all right. i'll make sure and remember.
3289	B: well, there are lots of things to consider. quality and delivery times are as important as price. we also take into consideration technical support and after-sales service. we look for companies with a good track record. we place a few trial orders and if everything goes well, we put them on our approved list. it's important to choose companies you feel you can work closely with.
3290	A: certainly. ok, got you.
3291	B: so cool! can i get a load of it?
3292	A: gee! i don't know what to say! thanks so much.
3293	B: my husband, my mother-in-law, my daughter and i.
3294	A: how many places have you worked altogether?
3295	B: sir, only your mother wants to please you more than we do.
3296	B: we can do that, but you'll have to pay a little extra.
3297	A: okay ... end of the first quarter ... alright, i' m gonna make a beer run.
3298	B: i appreciate your help.
3299	B: we do balance each other out well. i guess we were really made for each other!
3300	B: i' m just going to stay at pcc.
3301	A: yes. thanks.
3302	A: of course!
3303	A: no, double b for bravo
3304	B: last year when i visited china.
3305	A: bring me a bottle of beer.
3306	B: thanks. bye.
3307	B: yes. you'll get a picture of serena playing with the racket and a document from her.
3308	A: what does that mean, not big but fat? you didn't buy ...
3309	B: yes, simple as it is. it does work.
3310	A: thank you.
3311	A: hey, thanks, mum.
3312	B: you will.
3313	A: i really, really want a house, even though it is small like a snail house.
3314	A: well, that' s life, isn' t it?
3315	A: i'm always interested in how, but seldom pay much attention to who.
3316	B: yes, it' s reasonably fast but it certainly isn' t cheap. fares have gone up 25 present.
3317	B: here's your receipt.
3318	B: i think i' d like to do that. i could take the things i learn here back to my country when i have finished my studies.
3319	B: all right. thanks.
3320	A: they are well known for high quality, that' s why.
3321	B: that's the spirit. never give up on your dream.
3322	A: oh, dear, go get another pair. i'll help you change your shorts.
3323	A: cheers.
3324	A: my pleasure.
3325	B: me too.
3326	B: thank you, sir.
3327	B: no problem, i'll settle that now. you can take it from my business account.
3328	B: i agree with you, but that's easier said than done.
3329	B: no, i hate swimming. i prefer playing tennis.
3330	A: my pleasure.
3331	B: i think i'll ty the crisp deep-fried chicken.
3332	A: ok. don' t let it get to you. goodbye.
3333	B: don't ask me. i don't wanna be involved in your quarrel.
3334	B: mr. white, too.
3335	A: bye.
3336	B: thank you. but i' m sorry i' m in a bad mood at the moment.
3337	B: calm down.
3338	B: yeah, fine. and dressing leather shoes.
3339	A: i wish i could find one just like it.
3340	B: i've done it for you.
3341	A: yes, maybe i should.
3342	A: bye!
3343	B: i sure will.
3344	A: never believe his words.
3345	B: no problem. wait for a moment.
3346	B: got it.
3347	B: about two years now.
3348	B: all right, ma'am.
3349	B: no problem.
3350	B: you're welcome.
3351	A: ah, great! i'll send someone over to pick it up. thanks for calling.
3352	A: that's because i went to school for each class when i was at school. so now i am much more clever than you.
3353	B: so that's the family reunification.
3354	B: that' ll be all. thank you very much.
3355	B: i hope so.
3356	B: i am working in a small company where further promotion is impossible, so i decided to change my job. i'd like to find a job which is more challenging.
3357	B: here we are. you find us a table and i'll get the drinks.
3358	A: come on. you' ll feel better after we hit the showers.
3359	A: thanks a lot, brad. i've got to go before the bell rings.
3360	A: this is interesting, ms.parker.
3361	B: oh, you've already grown up, son.
3362	A: do you think so? i don't like it very much. i found it rather uncomfortable.
3363	B: thanks, mary. you' re a real pal. i' ll call now to set up an interview.
3364	B: it' s my pleasure, madam.
3365	B: oh, i wish i didn' t have so much to carry.
3366	B: i am knowledgeable and levelheaded.
3367	A: here's a check for ten dollars.
3368	B: well, he has already taken you know, that's his wife right there.
3369	A: well, that's true. in a sense, it is not so much what you drink that really counts, as where and how you drink.
3370	A: you look like a cooking show host--only messier.
3371	B: just walk down this road and you'll find it. it's on the right side.
3372	B: thank you.
3373	B: that' s simple. many people break the rules regarding their visa conditions.
3374	B: here you are.
3375	B: i' m ready and willing to help.
3376	A: thank you.
3377	B: oh, he really should.
3378	A: ok, here you are.
3379	B: i am bilingual, english and russian.
3380	A: i believe you can do a good job.
3381	A: fine.
3382	A: well, let me know when you can get it fixed. i' d love to go for a ride in it!
3383	B: are you kidding? don had fun scaring you. he'd probably buy you dinner if we go back.
3384	B: sure. now you are talking.
3385	A: ok, i won't.
3386	A: wo, wo, that certainly is a lot for a young man to take on.
3387	A: oh, no, it won't. just stand there, please.
3388	B: okay, i'll take it out front right now.
3389	B: two small boxes.
3390	B: welcome here again.
3391	B: sorry, i don't feel like playing. i have too much homework.
3392	A: those people are quarrelling.
3393	B: ok, i'll take it.
3394	A: i am not picky on food. just bring me the day menu.
3395	A: great. then call me and let me know if she's free.
3396	B: very smart!
3397	B: yes, that's very important.
3398	B: i beg your pardon?
3399	B: i hope so, too.
3400	B: would an order of only 100 units, it'll be difficult to work within that kind of budget. maybe if you were ordering 500 units or more units, we might be able to work something out.
3401	A: so it is no wonder people cannot keep faith with it.
3402	A: oh. i like this one. i have been looking for this color and design. please wrap it for me, and i' ll take it.
3403	B: yeah, i guess i am. working at a university is really suits me.
3404	A: it's normal. time will change everything.
3405	B: wonderful, i'll go with you.
3406	A: yes, blue cheese please.
3407	B: at the age of 64? you're kidding!
3408	A: yes, you are right.
3409	A: thank you.
3410	B: yes, it will print immediately.
3411	B: i prefer boxing to beef.
3412	A: i'm glad that we've settled the price.
3413	B: i like spring. the days are long and the night are short. the flowers are in bloom.we go on picnics.
3414	B: of course. i will be here minutes later.
3415	B: all right.
3416	B: so far, less than 20 people have died, but over 100 are in hospital.
3417	B: thanks anyway, but i'll do it, rebecca. let's get to class.
3418	B: thanks; i' ll give them a call later.
3419	B: i' m going to start taking classes at the local community college to try to improve my skills. then i' ll start looking for a new position.
3420	B: maybe we should just wait for the next bus.
3421	A: i only buy them if they look particularly interesting. i don' t buy any regularly.
3422	B: yes, there have been a few problems recently. why don't you call the it department?
3423	B: if you did, you probably got ripped off.
3424	A: that sounds good. i'm going to order the same thing.
3425	B: there we go. thanks very much.
3426	B: about 20% of them come from other countries and the others are employed from domestic universities and colleges.
3427	B: thank you very much!
3428	B: what do you do there ... hang around, like the kids?
3429	A: yeah-all from italy. see all the saints? they're important to roman catholics.
3430	B: no, you' re kidding. i' m not taking it seriously.
3431	A: if he doesn't change his attitude toward his work, i don't think a new job can make any difference.
3432	B: many thanks.
3433	B: ok, as john after kennedy put it, let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate.
3434	B: it's january.
3435	B: i agree. maybe they can bring us some better food.
3436	B: that's right. now try on this one. it's size 41.
3437	B: yes, we do. here is your bill and receipt.
3438	B: ok, let's go to the cinema to see what's on.
3439	B: she is at the supermarket downstairs. she said she would be back in about half an hour.
3440	B: well, the airport is quite far from the downtown area, but it is still more convenient than taking the train.
3441	A: i think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends, and then the right person will come along.
3442	B: thats a clever way to escape responsibility.
3443	B: thank you very much, your honor.
3444	B: i will. thank you, dad.
3445	A: right.
3446	B: you ought to complain. these machine are always out of order.
3447	B: i will.
3448	B: good luck.
3449	A: yes, i will. thanks for your care.
3450	B: thanks, hugh. i owe you one.
3451	B: i' m so lucky. you only get a chance like this once in a blue moon! thanks honey!
3452	B: yes, please. please print your name and company name, and the person you are going to see.
3453	B: i'll say. the regular eighteen is just about all i can handle myself.
3454	A: exactly! move your arms in a relaxed manner. well. don't stretch yourfingers stiffly. just keep them in a natural shape.
3455	B: that would be great.
3456	B: it sounds amazing to me.
3457	B: i'm ready. i'll look forward to it all friday!
3458	B: a road bike features skinny tires and a light-weight frame. its riding position puts you bent over the handlebars. it's not particularly beefy in construction, and generally, it won't stand up well under heavy loads or on really rough surfaces. in contrast, mountain bikes have wide tires and a stout frame. you sit higher on them and don't have to hunched over.
3459	B: for a local call, just insert 35 cents in the slot and use it in the same way as your home phone. inquiries are free from a public phone.
3460	B: don't mention it.
3461	B: that's fine. please send it to my room tomorrow morning.
3462	B: it's the time to emphasize sense of crises.
3463	B: it's better for you.
3464	B: this is gonna be a great barbecue!
3465	B: no. the only thing i need to see is your driver's license.
3466	B: dear, forgive me. i won' t do that again.
3467	A: no, honey, try to make notes in your notebook.
3468	A: absolutely.
3469	B: that sounds perfect and just what i'm looking for.
3470	A: i couldn't agree with you.
3471	B: look at it this way, when you quit, you will save money, time and your life!
3472	B: well, wait a minute.
3473	B: i've finished.
3474	B: certainly.it has been specially treated.
3475	B: i'm from madras.
3476	B: goodbye.
3477	B: well, just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading, i think you know what you need to know.
3478	B: well, i know you are interested in architecture, so you should't miss the temple of heaven, and the great wall is a must too.
3479	B: my pleasure.
3480	A: oh great, i' ll see you there!
3481	B: that would be good.
3482	B: here's your change. thank you for shopping with us.
3483	B: good, thanks. i look forward to hearing from you.
3484	B: you bet!
3485	B: yes. you've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise.
3486	B: i am going to send you to a neurologist for a few tests.
3487	A: me too. if we don' t do something soon, it might be too late.
3488	A: god it. thans very much.
3489	A: ok. i like the design of this lamps. i also need some cushion covers. i' ll just browse through those ones over there.
3490	B: okay. wait a minute please.
3491	B: bye.
3492	B: ok.
3493	B: chicken!
3494	A: it could be pretty tough studying abroad. being so far away from home ...
3495	B: all right.
3496	A: fine, i' ll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogs on thursday.
3497	B: poor ben, your wife is too mean to you. she gives you so little money every time when you are out.
3498	A: neither do i. let's stay in a cabin.it ' ll be much nicer right beside the ocean.
3499	A: yes. i have. i liked it very much. like you, i was very impressed with rachel' s performance in the movie. she' s going to be a star.
3500	B: i'll make sure and make it to the next one.
3501	B: that'll be Â¥150.
3502	A: thank you vary much.
3503	A: i'm getting a bit plump myself. perhaps i' ll go with you.
3504	B: would you like to donate to our alumni fund?
3505	B: it's great!
3506	A: well, fish it will be then.
3507	B: that's wonderful! icing on the cake.
3508	B: he sounds more like an artist than a businessman.
3509	B: this area here is where we keep our raw materials. the main production area - our machine hall - is situated next to it. maintenance is situated between the stores and the production area. just to the right of maintenance, there are steps up to the lab and the admin section. process control is also on the upper level. it's located above the factory floor so that the operators can monitor everything that is going on below.
3510	A: that' s great. but i prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain.
3511	A: oh!
3512	A: sure. let' s go.
3513	B: oh, you do? you certainly have a large selection.
3514	B: ok, that's all.
3515	B: actually, it's not the fault of the mobile phone. but people should have a proper attitude towards it. mobile phone is a tool serving people, not the fetters restricting them.
3516	B: you're welcome.
3517	A: it is so nice of you.
3518	A: that is truly amazing!
3519	A: that' s true. there' s clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. music can influence a person' s feeling and character.
3520	B: no, that's enough. t hank you.
3521	B: ok. do you have the receipt with you? i think they will ask you to show them the receipt first.
3522	B: yes. here it is.
3523	B: no. i'm still single.
3524	B: yes, goodbye and keep in touch.
3525	B: you' re welcome. have a nice trip.
3526	A: ha-ha, see you then.
3527	B: i' ll be paying with cash.
3528	A: here you are.
3529	B: yes. let's start today.
3530	B: i'll go take a shower.
3531	A: perhaps i should call her later.
3532	B: thanks. now i' d like to check out this book.
3533	B: absolutely.she ' s a teacher of aerobics.
3534	B: it depends what it is. once we have disconnected the unit, we do as many jobs as we can. if there is something that isn't broken but might cause a problem before the next service then of course we repair it or replace that part. but if it's not urgent, we make a note in the service record to carry out that repair next time.
3535	B: maybe this is god's will.
3536	B: yes, indeed.
3537	B: i think i'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you.
3538	B: and he can move, too! he dances like ricky martin!
3539	B: sounds good. i want to go get some coffee.
3540	A: i'll never again come to your side; i am turn away now and can't return.
3541	B: ok, i'll have it for a change.
3542	B: there aren't many things you can get for a nickel, sir.
3543	A: let' s go together.
3544	B: no. that' s everything. thank you.
3545	A: it's this cold weather we're having.
3546	B: me too.
3547	A: ok. i get it. i'm getting back into bed ...
3548	B: not bad. but she's as busy as before.
3549	B: but i don' t like big strong dogs.
3550	B: i usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn. i try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city.
3551	A: thank you.
3552	B: oh, the company is the fourth largest machine producer in the world. it was founded in the united states in 1980. i know that the company has made good use of advanced technology.
3553	B: it surely is.
3554	A: thank you very much.
3555	B: of course. the website is ' www. zhilian - zhaopin. com. cn '.
3556	A: you know, i really must be going now or i'll be very late. can you give me a call tomorrow an we'll decide?
3557	A: sounds like you are really getting in shape!
3558	B: of course, that's something really irritating. and the only way to avoid being trapped is to know in advance about the real worth of the stuff. i recommend you to consult the price tags in the supermarket first. and then you may negotiate for a fair deal.
3559	B: where is our camera? let's see if we can catch this on film!
3560	A: certainly not. the object of weigh is to surround a larger area than the opponent. in other words, each side is struggling for a greater living space by mapping out a territory on the board. hence, chess aims to kill, while weigh is most concerned with howso survive.
3561	B: you might not believe this, but i used to be twice the size that i am now!
3562	A: thank you very much.
3563	A: who knows!
3564	B: it looks good. pack me a bouquet of violet, please.
3565	B: well, honey, i can teach you how to plant them if you want to learn.
3566	A: generally speaking, food items are difficult to import. food with the short shelf life is liable to spoil in the time it takes to ship from one place to another. the only food items we import are specialty canned or preserved foods. the shelf life is longer for these products.
3567	A: shut up. you should think how to make fortunes, not look for a squabble.
3568	B: good-bye, sir
3569	A: no, my wife doesn' t like traveling. we haven' t been traveling for more than ten years. the first time we traveled together was in 1978 when we just got married. we spent our honeymoon in the alps.
3570	B: thank you so much.
3571	B: they're still fighting hard. let's wait and see.
3572	B: i bet he is. he domed his own life.
3573	A: oh baby, i' m so sorry.
3574	B: yes.let ' s start today.
3575	B: your food will be brought to you momentarily. i hope you enjoy it.
3576	B: thank you for your inviting me. see you then. bye tom.
3577	B: phew!. .. wait a minute, crash? ?! ! spyware? trojans! what? where? when ?!
3578	B: sure. wait a moment.
3579	B: about two months.
3580	B: you should try it. you won't be disappointed.
3581	B: it's good to have you in the group. we can always use a good baritone!
3582	B: yeah.
3583	B: ok, we will send a repairman to your room right now.
3584	A: yes, sir. i assure you it would never happen again.
3585	A: i only paid two dollars for mine.
3586	B: alright, sir. i will get the paperwork ready for you. just a moment.
3587	A: ok, sounds good. but i think it's your trick.
3588	A: i'm not at all keen on this subject.
3589	B: thank you.
3590	B: how did you get it?
3591	A: ok. let's make it.
3592	A: bingo!
3593	B: sure.
3594	B: yes, i do.
3595	B: goodbye.
3596	B: i'd like to go and live there for at least another year. probably i'll go back to sydney or maybe i'll go down to melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city. they have lot of museums and parks.
3597	B: yes, sir.
3598	A: good luck to you.
3599	B: thank you.
3600	B: it doesn't matter. just do your best to sell yourself.
3601	B: well, i' m not really a spring chicken anymore. we don' t know what will happen.
3602	B: i can't figure out which dress to wear.
3603	A: he was very clever when he was a boy.
3604	A: i have confidence in them.
3605	B: maybe you're right. but i'm still worried.
3606	B: i' d like to bring to abc company not only my technical skills, ambition, enthusiasm, but also my loyalty, a sensor desire to become an administrative assistant. it is the hardest of my career plans.
3607	B: be brave. don't worry. you will be able to walk soon.
3608	B: sure. i don't want to waste even a minute.
3609	A: you're welcome.
3610	B: there really isn' t anything else to do right now except wait. you are already pre-qualified for your loan.
3611	B: yes. i hope so.
3612	B: ok, will do!
3613	B: no, i hate swimming. i prefer playing tennis.
3614	A: you put it in the slot at the turnstile and then push the turnstile to get into the platform.
3615	B: i' m sold! i want to book this trip. i don' t care what it costs! money is no object!
3616	A: see you.
3617	A: i' m sorry to hear about that.
3618	A: thank you. i have to leave now. if you see pamela, tell her i'll write to her.
3619	B: well-done, please.
3620	B: it' s a start, but i' ll be happy when i see you stick to your promise!
3621	B: poor me!
3622	A: these are specially designed for the year 2000!
3623	B: thank you.
3624	B: thank you.
3625	B: that depends. if you are lucky, you can see a vivid rainbow across over two peaks.
3626	B: it seems you have to take time.
3627	B: we can certainly give you faster turnaround, but it will cost you extra.
3628	B: i apologize for forgetting myself, but i do need some time off.
3629	B: i appreciate the effort, sir.
3630	B: that's all right.
3631	A: speaking of cold, how about going for a cup of coffee to warm up.
3632	A: make it work, geoff. you would say that, wouldn' t you, he is your cousin.what a jerk, make me hire your stupid, useless, cousin.
3633	A: all right. see you then.
3634	B: well, here you are. remember to put it in a proper place.
3635	B: cheers!
3636	A: good idea. thank you.
3637	B: i' m really sorry, mr. samuel. i really don' t remember that.
3638	A: i appreciate your kindness.
3639	B: you are welcome!
3640	A: don't worry. you'll do fine.
3641	B: yeah. he's a private eye now.
3642	B: ok, let's sign it.
3643	B: forget it, there is no use crying over the spilled milk.
3644	A: ok. hurry up.
3645	B: well. in that case, we will have to go to another restaurant. thank you all the same.
3646	B: a little bit expensive, but i will buy one. this is $ 25, here you are.
3647	A: that' s right. make sure you give the accounts department all your bank account details as soon as possible.
3648	B: i would like that.
3649	A: no, thanks. i'll have to meet my friend at the airport.
3650	B: i import canned food.
3651	B: you' re welcome.
3652	B: yes, there is. those organizations exist. you always can call a lawyer if you need legal help.
3653	B: their interest rates are usually quite high. it' s a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest.
3654	A: if you could, please. that would be wonderful, thanks.
3655	A: goodbye. hope to see you again next year.
3656	B: see you tomorrow night.
3657	B: let's go. it sounds interesting.
3658	A: exactly!
3659	A: well, i have to hide in the air-conditioned rooms. anyway, it is all worth, just think about the cool evening time.
3660	A: well, our intention is to have some features about these regions in some youth magazines. we' re also going to run some ads on tv and put some flyers in places where young people go, like the gym and student organizations. we' re making arrangements to have some activities at big shopping malls and department stores around town.
3661	B: thanks.
3662	B: the chinatown in vancouver is the second largest chinatown in the north america.
3663	B: i think you should give it a shot. what do you have to lose? you can always change your mind.
3664	B: yes.
3665	B: let' s have you come back in a few days and see how you feel.
3666	A: thanks for everything.
3667	A: failure just isn't an option for her. i'm glad she's on our team.
3668	B: yes, of course. the balance sheet contains 3 major sections, that is, assets, liabilities and owner's equity.
3669	A: thank you. but i' m not interested.
3670	B: yeah, i will.
3671	B: she likes to complain about her macho husband and her "bambinos ", but she loves them all dearly.
3672	B: of course, sir. you've made a good choice.
3673	B: i'm afraid i know less than you do.tell me more about her, will you?
3674	B: this is going to be a major production for you!
3675	B: the 5th.
3676	B: i' d rather you didn' t come immediately as i said i' m very busy at the moment. come after lunch, mark.
3677	A: so, i want to recommend them for a raise. fred is promoted to be the assistant of manager in marketing department and david to be director of office.
3678	A: ok. that sounds like a deal.
3679	B: ok. i will mention how great you were about helping me today. i appreciate your help.
3680	A: two copies? one to keep and one to cut the pictures out of, right?
3681	B: no problem at all, sir. housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit.
3682	A: you are right about that.
3683	B: dress casually.
3684	B: thank you. see you.
3685	A: thanks, goodbye.
3686	B: it should be no longer than an hour.
3687	B: i can't believe it.
3688	B: i will bring them to your room tomorrow afternoon.
3689	B: it's valentine's day. come on. just go.
3690	A: sound like everything is great.
3691	B: let's try it!
3692	B: jeez. tourists.
3693	B: well, i just wanted to say well done. really you did a great job.
3694	B: i think i have nothing to declare. i have just brought a bottle of wine.
3695	B: yes, it is smith.
3696	B: all right. i' ll see you on friday.
3697	A: i see. it looks like there are still a lot of issues we need to work on in the us.
3698	B: certainly, as long as you don't tell my wife.
3699	A: yeah, my wife likes that one, too. personally, i prefer action movies.
3700	B: don't mention it, larry. what are friends for anyway?
3701	B: and it takes two to make an agreement too. you have no guts, i am afraid.
3702	A: she feels you gave me the freedom to be able to assist her and she appreciates that. come on, let's indulge her.
3703	B: good-bye, and thank you for shopping here.
3704	A: i'm saying this ship needs a new captain. are you with me, or aren't you?
3705	B: i think i might just go to the movies.
3706	B: no problem.
3707	A: and about time too!
3708	A: i got it.
3709	B: no, not at all.
3710	B: i'm sorry. i've been having some problems.
3711	B: don' t worry. it' s only a cold.
3712	A: i've tried to give up smoking several times, but it's no use.
3713	B: i have been yearning for a job as a stewardess in an airline like yours.
3714	B: there you go.
3715	B: yes, mum.
3716	B: thank you very much. this is for your help.
3717	B: have a nice nap.
3718	B: i have to get home, but i don't need all of this fancy technology, i think i'll just walk.
3719	A: thanks. and of course, could you fill in the exchange form?
3720	B: actually, my mother made it from scratch.
3721	A: sometimes i think oscars are only awarded to movies that make a lot of money.
3722	B: yes. if you want to order room service, just press 0 on your phone, and that will connect you with the front desk.
3723	B: ah, ah, you promised, and remember?
3724	B: all right, i see.
3725	B: i' m not sure, but i will arrange for you and inform you as well.
3726	A: i' ve already paved the way. you just have to give a presentation on what our products are. i will do the follow-up and close the sale.
3727	B: (a moment later) it's cute.the color suits my complexion.
3728	A: inform my members to prepare for the travelling. and then we can discuss about the travelling costs.
3729	A: okay, that's clear enough. let's move on to the other terms.
3730	B: you're welcome. we wish you a speedy recovery. goodbye.
3731	A: thank you very much.
3732	B: thank you.
3733	B: once a month.
3734	B: no problem. bob.
3735	B: here you are.
3736	B: of course to me.
3737	B: you're welcome.
3738	B: i know ...
3739	B: shandong.
3740	B: that's settled then. i'll contact you later.
3741	B: in seoul. but the company has operations in over fifty countries and thirty factories all over the world.
3742	A: oh ...
3743	B: thanks.
3744	B: without doubt, rock is trash.
3745	A: not for now, i think, but i believe there'll be rain, so take your raincoat with you.
3746	A: ok, i'll process that for you now.
3747	B: no problem.
3748	A: yes, let's go.
3749	A: how do you do?
3750	B: ok, i will bring you photos as many as possible.
3751	A: ok, i see.
3752	B: you're going to like him. everybody says he's a nice guy.
3753	A: ok. i' ll let you know when i' ve sorted out my clothes.
3754	B: i like it.
3755	B: because too many people in the office are on holiday.
3756	B: we have great confidence in you.
3757	B: i bet that you wish you hadn't done that.
3758	A: but he has suffered a lot.
3759	A: well, after the half of the meeting, there will be an interval for rest and refreshment.
3760	A: here.near this school.
3761	B: thank you.
3762	B: i'm sure we will. actually, we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder.
3763	B: ok, i will take one.
3764	B: you'll have to try for yourself some day.
3765	B: back to live with my parents.that ' s something else i used to do before we were married.remember?
3766	B: anyway, i have to face the music this time.
3767	B: i'm in a bit of a hurry today, so we'd better make it to go. thanks for asking.
3768	B: make it two.
3769	B: why don't you take it for a test drive, and think it over.
3770	B: maybe we can think of something somewhere between a chick flick and a horror movie!
3771	A: fabulous. i will get the contract ready shortly.
3772	B: they said he was an honest and professional businessman. but that's the exciting part. it's kind of like gambling ...
3773	B: come on in, please.
3774	B: i work at yangshi trade company ltd. i have been working there since 1997.
3775	B: see you then.
3776	B: i'm only too happy to help.
3777	B: i don' t know.
3778	A: mr .: yes. by the way, review today's notes this evening. we may have a small quiz tomorrow.
3779	B: she is a young man!
3780	B: i'm sorry. you're right. i should have asked.
3781	B: how can you do that?
3782	A: you liar, i saw you again in the inn. i bet you don't want to work at all.
3783	B: that's just perfect for me. i live pretty far from the centre and it can be a chore getting in.
3784	B: not too good yet. better than i was though.
3785	A: but then what would i do every weekend?
3786	B: employees are covered by worker's compensation insurance.
3787	B: oh, i prefer it loose
3788	B: do you really think so? i mean, was i? er ... you ... must be disappointed.
3789	A: yes, i will need it. thanks.
3790	B: certainly.
3791	B: oh, thanks, professor donald. this is really very nice of you.
3792	A: your passport, please.
3793	A: oh, i don't know.it depends.
3794	A: let me have it, please. i'm taking some laundry downstairs anyway.
3795	A: ok, superman. put on your cape, we are going to fly home.
3796	A: yeah man, i' m starving!
3797	B: that's great, here you are. this is my passport.
3798	B: sure, why not? i could use a rest.
3799	B: oh, i' m too lazy to play sports, and i' m not good at anything either. it hardly excites me.
3800	B: the ones that are on sale are from central america.
3801	A: just did my best.
3802	A: good-bye.
3803	B: the same as usual.
3804	A: ar! dad, the power went out.
3805	B: you' re unbearable; you can walk home, i' m leaving.
3806	B: we can get both at the cafeteria.
3807	A: good idea.
3808	B: no, you don't have to. here comes the train. be careful! subway doors open and close automatically.
3809	B: i love you, happy anniversary.
3810	B: all right. that sounds fair.
3811	A: well, if you say so. personally speaking, i' d rather die of thirst than drink champagne.
3812	B: i can understand your position. we can not make any promise, but we'll try our best.
3813	B: he certainly looks interested, doesn' t he? shall we invite him over to our table?
3814	A: it' s unbelievable. he used to be such a rough guy.
3815	B: you really have keen eyes.
3816	B: you' re welcome. feel free to ask me any time you need help.
3817	A: please yourself.
3818	B: that's great! can you give me the key to the locker? i can't wait to have a try.
3819	B: you must have got many useful things for your new apartment.
3820	A: sounds cool! but that is not what a lady should do. people are easy to lose head in a night club and being drunk.
3821	B: thank you for appreciating it.
3822	B: no wonder you say english is a crazy language.
3823	B: yes, if we're busy. i'm paid double-time if i work at weekends.
3824	B: you know, he is a taxi driver. he has to have his eyes peeled all the time when he drives, especially during the rush hour.
3825	B: it was my pleasure.
3826	B: wow, you are going to be busy this semester! okay, here you go. you are registered now. you' ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.
3827	B: yes, but it must be treated in an effluent treatment plant first.
3828	B: i feel the same way.
3829	B: it's two blocks down the road.
3830	B: oh, that's why my parents never scold me that day. they always try to avoid tears and quarrels.
3831	B: i will. bye.
3832	B: i'm on my way.
3833	A: victory for me, i bought it for 30 bucks just yesterday!
3834	B: and they, too, want to make sure their loan is worthwhile.
3835	B: my grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day.
3836	B: wow, i like concerts.
3837	B: thank you very much.
3838	B: let's take a cab.
3839	A: i see.
3840	A: thank you.
3841	B: she'll be fine.
3842	A: that's great. we will have to charge you 250 rib for that service, though. could you please fill in this? thanks.
3843	B: i think i might go and find me my own pair of chucks.
3844	B: you too.
3845	B: russian is my second foreign language and i excelled the rest of my class in russian because my father is a russian.
3846	B: what an idiot!
3847	B: yes, i will.
3848	B: to be honest, in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place, we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment.
3849	B: another big step forward in saving on our office equipment, i don' t need a desktop anymore. a laptop is enough.
3850	B: well, take care of yourself. and hope you will be better as soon as possible.
3851	B: i've got over seven years ' experience working in this kind of position. i know i can do a good job in this position.
3852	A: not only that. the job i' m doing now is the most boring job you can imagine.
3853	B: definitely. i have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month.
3854	B: it is unnecessary. i'll see you off at the airport.
3855	B: as you know, my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean. but people still go swimming all year around. i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning.
3856	B: i'll go to the yellow stone park, and great canyon.
3857	A: yes, me too. oh, here's susan now. let me introduce you.
3858	A: don't be so shy, lucy.
3859	A: well, i collect beer mats. i' m not sure that counts, though.
3860	B: excellent! let' s set off.
3861	B: i think it is a smart idea. our boss always likes it when employees take initiatives.
3862	B: i'll ask mrs. thou when she's available to show the apartment and let you know. has your number changed?
3863	A: good idea! let's make ready, then.
3864	B: i hope you can stay for dinner. i need a guinea pig!
3865	B: an aisle seat, please.
3866	A: i'm really sick!
3867	B: i'll just have water.
3868	B: sure, we call it doubt.
3869	B: good idea.
3870	A: oh, i'll probably just stay at home.
3871	A: yeah. we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home.
3872	A: merry christmas!
3873	A: you are not funny either. i can't believe i married a woman like you.
3874	A: i just cann't believe my ears!
3875	B: okay. thanks. have a nice day.
3876	B: ok. would you like me to get you a cab?
3877	A: that's fine. i'll get on with that for you right now.
3878	B: oh, i was just thinking about getting a bite to eat. have you had lunch yet?
3879	B: i' ll make sure he gets the message.
3880	B: you can suck a candy or pinch your nose gently while breathing out. that shall help.
3881	B: i don' t understand. maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool.
3882	B: forgive me darling. i'm very tired.
3883	A: good-bye. see you again sometime.
3884	B: all right.got it.
3885	B: you're embarrassed, aren't you? you gotta loosen up in little italy. the lady at the cafe will kiss you when you meet her ...
3886	B: there you go.
3887	B: thanks, i will. i'll see you tomorrow then!
3888	A: you' re right. i' ll save the beer for when we land. one orange juice, please.
3889	B: that will be good.
3890	A: you certainly deserve it. let's celebrate!
3891	B: so we can get down to business.
3892	B: all right. we'll have some seafood and vegetables.
3893	A: better luck this time!
3894	B: 21st talent website, 51 job, and zhaopin.com are most popular.
3895	A: great. thanks a lot.
3896	B: good idea.
3897	B: well, it can cause smog, which can affect people's health - especially people with breathing difficulties.
3898	B: he was too desperate to find some other way.
3899	A: okay. no problem.
3900	A: that will be 80 yuan altogether. here is your invoice.
3901	B: i hate to disappoint you, but unlike what most people think, we aren't all exactly the same!
3902	A: ok. bingo! we win. give me five, mom.
3903	B: i think so.thank you.
3904	B: all right, it's a date.
3905	A: that will be fine. we' ll have your meals ready when you arrive. thank you for your order.
3906	B: you're welcome.
3907	B: no, usually they're very busy.
3908	B: if you don't know it by now, you might as well not bother studying.
3909	B: all right, i will start working now.
3910	B: sure. thanks.
3911	B: no problem, man.
3912	B: so do i.
3913	B: you are quite right.
3914	B: i don't know. in costa rica, i taught adults.so it was a very different thing. so i really can't compare.
3915	B: yes.
3916	B: well, good luck!
3917	B: ok!
3918	A: my pleasure.
3919	B: we can' t. if we went that fast, we would break the speed limit.
3920	B: ok. i will bring it with me.
3921	A: you mother is not only a patient mother but also a gentle wife.
3922	A: well, when you tell him, be gentle. it's hard for kids to find out something like that.
3923	B: that's what we're here for, the human resources help you need, when and how you need it.
3924	B: awesome!
3925	B: it's too late.
3926	B: all right. all right.
3927	B: twenty eight dollars.
3928	A: no way. i've given you too many chances already.
3929	B: because your travel agency has a good fame in this market; what's more, all the staff here are working very hard. i like doing some challenging job.
3930	B: yes, people just seem to drift apart.
3931	B: well, the newspaper is over there. look in the want ads, but i don' t know what you' re going to find without a college degree.
3932	A: okay.
3933	B: well, you should talk with your son and let him make his own decision.
3934	A: it' s the anniversary of our weeding.
3935	B: to drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. good luck!
3936	A: it's of good quality.
3937	B: i think whiskey will be a good choice.
3938	B: anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!
3939	B: well, we have no problems with our credit rating, i can assure you.
3940	B: do you mean it? i'd love to!
3941	A: that's all right.
3942	B: oh, it's delicious ...
3943	A: wow, that is cheap. thank you very much.
3944	A: oh dear, we will miss our train.
3945	B: you can count on me.
3946	A: but ... ok.
3947	A: i wouldn't either. it's been looking like rain for several days.
3948	B: no, thank you. i'm afraid i can't take in anymore.
3949	B: excellent. we will meet all your conditions if you can meet our demands.
3950	B: aren't you the pot calling the kettle black? you're wearing my pants right now!
3951	B: ok, let's go.
3952	B: i am hoping that this test goes well for me.
3953	A: you' re welcome.
3954	B: sounds good.
3955	A: i'll make it up to you. let me know how much it costs and i'll give you the money.
3956	A: a cup of coffee, please.
3957	B: well, for city dwellers, the spring festival is a holiday of seven days. while in the country where traditions are still heavily emphasized, the festival lasts ten days.
3958	B: thank you.
3959	B: after that i choose something from one of the few brands that i know will fit me. i prefer white, so i ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size. since i' m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications, it makes it a very easy choice.
3960	B: you are welcome.
3961	B: let me see. i am sorry. zw203 is the only one to new york.
3962	A: but look at them! they've forgotten about the wet cement and they're walking across it to put up the notice!
3963	B: thanksgiving day, independence day.
3964	B: we'll take great care.
3965	B: not really, perhaps just a translation problem, that's all. anyway, we've agreed to accept it.
3966	B: it doesn't seem to be so easy.
3967	B: i'm glad to hear that.
3968	A: but your were playing video games all afternoon. you are skating on thin ice.
3969	B: those were the good old days, sir, indeed.
3970	B: thanks so much, bye.
3971	A: they' ll never take me alive!
3972	A: sorry, sir. the angelica is out of stock now.
3973	B: i guess using a computer has a great deal to do with human interaction. getting in touch with each other must be more fun to your wife and my son than the coolest computer games or the hottest information.
3974	B: i'm sorry, sir. perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters.
3975	B: i'm sorry, but no. we used to have a trainer, but then he had an unfortunate accident.
3976	B: i stick to my principles and keep to the rules. sometimes, they just lack enthusiasm and i get them involved with something constructive. some of them change their attitude later.
3977	B: it's ultra-compact, it has a brushed, titanium metal body and a rubber shock-proof, weather-proof case with a belt clip.
3978	B: i can't. i am really behind of my work.
3979	A: surely. let' s get started by drafting a new contract.
3980	B: i didn't say i was going to deprive myself.
3981	A: thank you, sir. i will cancel mr. white's reservation from november 21st for 4 nights. we look forward to another chance to serve you.
3982	B: goodbye.
3983	A: i see.
3984	B: i think, as the saying goes haste makes waste, it is the same with marriage.
3985	A: some are genuine. but all our reproductions are clearly marked and priced.
3986	A: hopefully!
3987	A: thanks.
3988	A: yeah, it's hard to believe but true.
3989	B: yeah. it'll be a shoppers heaven. that's the use of net in e-commerce.
3990	A: ok, try these on in the changing rooms.
3991	B: but the brazilian is tougher.
3992	B: he had better make a change.
3993	B: i haven't told them. maybe i'll make them know after the vacation.
3994	B: yes. the gas station is on the left. and you can't miss it.
3995	B: i' m afraid you' re going in the opposite direction.
3996	B: that's ok.
3997	B: thanks, daisy.
3998	B: i believe i will. look for me near the lake.
3999	B: thank you.
4000	A: i wish we could, but we can't, you see, we are not insured.
4001	A: why not? i don't have anything better to do!
4002	B: ok. please step in. i know where it is.
4003	B: i appreciate your understanding.
4004	B: certainly.
4005	B: you might get a little dizzy, but that is it.
4006	A: very good idea. sometimes such pictures can show the house's richness.
4007	B: mind your own business.
4008	B: we are interested in cloth made in china. the clothes are sold very well here. we are a big location supplier for the northeast market here. i'm thinking that we'll have some business opportunities.
4009	B: i'll get used to not seeing my parents.
4010	A: as soon as you can get here. we'll be waiting for you.
4011	B: that's all, thank you.
4012	A: potato chips and french dressing.
4013	B: no, and let me tell you why ... if i make my guys stay over to check the inventory, i'll have to pay them at an overtime rate, which is time and a half. i estimate it will probably take 3 guys two hours to finish, that will be an increase on your labor fee by at least 10% ... if you need the numbers that urgently, i can have them do it. otherwise, we can wait until tomorrow morning, and i'll call you with the numbers after they're done. it's your call ...
4014	B: thanks for saying that.
4015	B: and the host announced that he won it all!
4016	B: nope.
4017	B: ready? say cheese.
4018	B: that' s just what i need. thanks so much. you' ve been a big help already.
4019	B: no problem, sir.
4020	B: because i needed the money. and because i was good at it. look! what do you think?
4021	A: yeah, i know. a friend in need is a friend indeed. i don't need fair-weather friends either.
4022	A: thank you very much.
4023	A: yes, i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds. but nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here.
4024	B: certainly.go ahead.
4025	B: ok. i can settle for that.
4026	B: i think that that would be a really good choice! let's call and make a reservation.
4027	B: i will leave a memo for you, sir.
4028	A: thank you.
4029	B: thank you.
4030	B: i am afraid not. tomorrow is premiere.
4031	B: these guys are professional. i think they can have it done tomorrow. let's ask.
4032	B: then let me take you out to dinner to celebrate.
4033	A: but there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness, food storage, and a series of physiological effects.
4034	B: all right.let ' s go.
4035	A: you're right. i probably should just work on my paper. thanks!
4036	B: sir, we always try to please our guests.
4037	A: yes, i'm afraid there is.
4038	B: i hope so.
4039	B: you're welcome.
4040	B: thanks for the warning! see you tomorrow!
4041	A: your order will be ready soon, thank you for calling.
4042	A: i hope so. let me know how many will come. then i will book the restaurant.
4043	A: by the way, how's the nose? boy, that must have hurt.
4044	A: very well, consider me gone.
4045	B: i worked as a pr clerk for one year
4046	B: jogging, yoga, or even just taking a walk.
4047	B: it's very nice. i'd like to purchase this refrigerator.
4048	B: i'm quite sure. i've always loved working with children.
4049	B: sure, i ' ll have a corona.
4050	A: okay, mr. horn, see you tomorrow at 10:30.
4051	A: do you think so? i don't like it very much. i found it rather uncomfortable.
4052	B: but many girls nowaday do want to marry a man filthy with dough.
4053	A: elvin? which one is he?
4054	B: wonderful! and, you mentioned ' perks '? i do hope i'll be getting some of those.
4055	B: you're welcome.
4056	B: well, i guess so.
4057	B: thank you.
4058	B: oh, god. i've almost forgotten. i'll get it done right away.
4059	B: you're right. let's ask her to give us one more week.
4060	B: not at the moment, but i' ll let you know.
4061	B: thank you very much. i think i lost it near the window.
4062	B: you are welcome.
4063	A: that's fine. i want 2 tickets.
4064	A: our hope is to establish mutual beneficial trading relations between us.
4065	A: it is lithium which can be used for over three years.
4066	A: that's not the end. they were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck.
4067	B: forget it, there is no use crying over the spilled milk.
4068	A: i had a few coffees while i was waiting. let's get out of here!
4069	B: coffee, only black coffee,
4070	A: how depressed!
4071	B: since 1996 it has been. and i bet i'd be pretty good at it. i ride my mountain bike to work almost every day.
4072	B: you are so paranoid! not everybody is a crook, you know.
4073	B: all right, thank you!
4074	A: you'll get used to it, mikel, trust me.
4075	B: certainly, it would be my pleasure, mr. smith.
4076	A: yes, please.
4077	B: i like what i see.
4078	B: as a matter of fact, i would like to work in south america. so some latin language like spanish or portuguese would work.
4079	B: good luck on your first election.
4080	B: brazil calls for a time out and we' ll be right back, after a short commercial break.
4081	B: then i' ll just use my credit card.
4082	A: mm. all my children hope to go to college. right?
4083	A: okay.
4084	B: we appreciate hearing that about you!
4085	B: i' m happy that we' ve come to an agreement.
4086	B: constantly. without doubt, and plays the lute. she has a natural ear.
4087	B: thanks.
4088	B: i think that you are right. maybe they can give us a free dessert or something.
4089	B: ouch, that hurts â did you have to mention her name?
4090	B: good luck!
4091	B: thank you for saying that.
4092	A: it is on the jianshe street where there is a carrefour supermarket near it.
4093	A: no problem, i'll play as hard as i can and give you an extra game to say thanks.
4094	A: that's true.
4095	A: my feet is size 37.
4096	B: you are welcome. come in early tomorrow and i'll show you how to do the scheduling.
4097	A: yes, i can remember it very well that there used to be all sorts of animals and birds.but nowadays you just don't see the birds that you used to see around here.
4098	A: why don' t you try then? even if it doesn' t help you find an american girl, you could still have a stronger and healthier body. you won' t lose anything by doing that.
4099	B: you' re right. everything is probably going to come to a head tonight. i' ll keep you informed.
4100	B: all right. this suits my taste best. i'ii take it.
4101	B: but i cannot forget him.
4102	B: two blocks down the street.
4103	B: here you are.
4104	B: if you want to cross here, be my guest. i don't feel like dodging cars and scooters!
4105	A: don't mention it.
4106	B: no problem at all. welcome.
4107	A: no problem. hope to see you again soon.
4108	B: sounds like fun. you can count me in! just give me directions to the restaurant.
4109	B: either call this extension number 0085 or ask them to send the fax to you as e-mail, you print it out.
4110	B: i see what you mean. that was pretty easy after all.
4111	B: well, that sounds like it would be ok. just be careful.
4112	A: i'd be up for that!
4113	A: all right. if you insist. next time it is on me, though.
4114	A: hmm, you're right.
4115	B: it is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of comfortable!
4116	A: she's been good. she is in grade one in joy chain high school. and she dreams to be a volunteer in 2008.
4117	B: here you are.
4118	A: ok. great idea!
4119	B: understanding comes from product differentiation.we get that through product demonstration, literature, expert testimonials, and the like.
4120	B: well, it won't last long.
4121	B: you're kidding!
4122	B: thanks a lot. you are so kind.
4123	B: thanks, i'll keep that in mind.
4124	B: i---i don' t feel like saying it.
4125	B: more than 100 times. the flight takes off at 12:00.
4126	B: don't bother. those are a dime a dozen where we are going.
4127	A: all right, see you later.
4128	A: thank you.
4129	A: (when they are dancing) you dance gracefully!
4130	B: i love this wine! it goes very well with the chicken.
4131	B: it' s going all right. i' m learning some things for the first time, but i' m also brushing up on some things that i already know.
4132	B: i like the way carl runs. he looks more graceful.
4133	B: yeah, it's a block away down the street.
4134	A: thanks. that'll be ok.
4135	A: don't worry about it.
4136	B: well, i 'd certainly come and visit you. it would be great to take a working holiday on a farm. i' d love to get away from hustle and bustle of the city for a while.
4137	A: i really appreciate your kind words.
4138	B: hey!
4139	B: bye.
4140	B: i think so. it's turning out to be a great day.
4141	B: i'm afraid i haven't got one in your size.
4142	A: of course. the fitting room is this way, please.
4143	B: it depends on how much you earned. when you file, they will determine the amount.
4144	B: bye.
4145	A: alright. i'll have a cup of tea waiting for you.
4146	B: i love apartment hunting. i' ll be happy to go with you.
4147	B: looks like anything fun makes you excited.
4148	B: then you can try some local products.they ' re also of good quality.
4149	B: that would be lovely. but now let's go and get a drink.
4150	B: let me see. that is no problem. i'll see you then.
4151	B: tracing back, yoga has a very long history. it was originated before india had approved yoga and these documents were arranged and written according to the contents passed by mouth to mouth. in other words, yoga is passed down from ancient times, which cannot be recalled.
4152	A: i'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference. i don't think we should continue with the tv advertising.
4153	B: downloading music is really fast and convenient, and you can preview all the songs before you buy them.
4154	A: thank you just the same.
4155	B: don' t worry. we won' t be the first.
4156	B: nah! this is boring! i' m gonna go play killer zombies on my playstation!
4157	B: no problem, girl friend. i'll see you next time.
4158	B: certainly. come back soon.
4159	B: oh, that's quite convenient. thank you.
4160	A: no problem. in the meantime, don't try to worry so much. you'll get through this.
4161	A: bye bye! have a pleasant journey!
4162	A: it seems that working in a foreign enterprise is not the same as i expected. thank you for your help.
4163	B: that will be all. you've been very helpful, thanks.
4164	B: ok, thank you.
4165	B: that' s all i needed to know. thanks.
4166	B: great. we will give you a chance to have an interview in our company.
4167	B: no. i just went cold turkey, and i never smoked again.
4168	B: it looks like you could use it. don' t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again.
4169	B: i'm really sorry, i'll bring you a hot one right away.
4170	B: i heard. but did you have to tear out his nose ring?
4171	B: thank you very much.
4172	B: i really envy you. you know i'm not taking my vacation until december.
4173	B: i think it had direct impact on my way of thinking. i learned to look at people and things from an overall perspective. in that case, i am not easy to be edgy.
4174	A: i forgot to bring it, but maybe mary has some. let's go and ask her.
4175	B: i'll just go and check it for you, sir.
4176	B: no problem.
4177	B: oh, yeah. ok. i'll just buy smallthings!
4178	B: right, i'll be right over.
4179	A: excellent. i' ll see you on thursday at 9 30.
4180	B: what were you screaming at me for?
4181	B: that should work. i' ll see you tomorrow when you return to work.
4182	A: thanks for tucking me, mom.
4183	B: but i must say, if it were only for the weather, i like autumn most!
4184	B: i' m sorry, mr. michael. could you tell me where the problems are exactly? maybe i misunderstood the client' s intentions.
4185	B: by bike, of course.you don't want to miss the beautiful scenery, do you?
4186	B: simply because it's not practical at all.
4187	B: thank you.
4188	A: anyhow, this dress is really elegant.
4189	A: don't mention it. that's what friends are for!
4190	B: well, here there are many different clubs you can get into, for free, you don't have to pay, some of them. in london it's really expensive for drinks and an entry fee.
4191	B: the most we can offer you at present is 600 dozen.
4192	B: thank you for all your help.
4193	A: ok. i will follow your advice.
4194	A: you really have a bid head, don't you!
4195	A: no. thanks for reminding me.
4196	A: good-bye. see you again sometime.
4197	B: i can speak and read cantonese because i worked in guangdong for many years.
4198	B: great.
4199	B: it makes me sick.
4200	B: thanks.
4201	A: you should go to the counter, just over there.
4202	A: here it is. have you got the advice slip with you? you have sufficient funds in the account, so we can go ahead.
4203	A: only less than 20 percent of the citizens speak english.
4204	B: i don't know.it ' s still up in tha air.
4205	A: the proposal is being repaired right now and i think it will be ready by tomorrow morning.
4206	A: all right, doctor. but it really hurts.
4207	B: yeah.
4208	B: wonderful.
4209	B: i took computer science and english courses as my minor subjects.
4210	B: ok.let ' s go.
4211	A: only on saturday and sunday from one to five p. m.
4212	A: the pleasure is mine. it's been nice talking with you. goodbye.
4213	B: true, but there are limits. being thin is one thing; starving oneself to death is another. no one forces them to do this.
4214	A: it's this cold weather we're having.
4215	A: i have a lot of work in the office and a lot of chores in the house.how i envy you, robin!
4216	B: a return ticket is forty-six pounds fifty.
4217	A: don't worry.
4218	B: thank you very much. this should only take me a few minutes.
4219	B: when you take something out of the stores you need to update the stores database so we know when to reorder.
4220	B: come on. let's split the difference, 15%.
4221	A: clean up the mess first, then fit a new seal and check the valve.
4222	B: you are so lucky! send me a postcard!
4223	B: ok, ok. i' m feeling a little dehydrated. let' s get something to drink.
4224	B: nice to meet you, i'm jim taylor.
4225	B: these girls are different, they are not wimpy.
4226	A: now we get along very well. it makes me feel that i'm someone special.
4227	A: that seems pretty reasonable. thanks.
4228	A: i don't think so. he only had no common sense.
4229	A: my pleasure.
4230	B: i braked as hard as i could.
4231	B: we'll see what happens after court.
4232	B: alright.
4233	B: thank you. goodbye.
4234	B: i hope so.
4235	A: oh, i see.
4236	B: i get it. thank you.
4237	B: oh, the smelly bean curd. my favorite!
4238	A: let me see ... we can see you this afternoon if you can come in at four thirty.
4239	A: no, don' t worry. just follow me.
4240	B: and the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise. my father is over 60 years old, and he lifts weights every day.
4241	A: oh, i see. i believe i can do the job well.
4242	A: the thing with large countries is that often they have vast areas of land that are useless or hardly used. russia and canada have enormous areas of ice and forest.
4243	B: thank you.
4244	A: no wonder! i'd be unhappy, too.
4245	B: i'm glad you enjoyed it.
4246	B: no way!
4247	B: we'll try our best. anyway, we assure you that shipment will be made not later than the first half of april.
4248	A: oh. i see. i would like to have mashed potatoes and chocolate pudding.
4249	B: please drive slowly, we've got lots of time. safety first.
4250	B: soup does the body good, sweetie. it's what you need when you're under the weather.
4251	A: a juice and a coke.
4252	A: ok. wait for a moment, please.
4253	A: good. i hope we can arrange the contract as soon as possible.
4254	A: ok.
4255	B: yes, the couple that i highlighted at today's show met on match.com and they're getting married this summer.
4256	A: that' s a lovely hat.
4257	B: sorry, my english isn' t so good. could you speak a little slower?
4258	B: don't go to too much trouble.
4259	B: thank you. the payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier' s check.
4260	A: that's ok. i'll try anything once, but sometimes, once is enough!
4261	B: i'm sure your wife will love them.
4262	A: yeah, definitely, tomorrow night.
4263	A: this is really exciting movie. lets go to this one.
4264	A: ok.she ' s near-sighted, with a pair of glasses on her nose.she is the only one wearing glasses in my family.
4265	A: but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons.
4266	B: sure. here you are.
4267	B: oh, really? i go to the rye every day.
4268	B: sure, that will be thirty-two dollars please.
4269	B: no problem, here you are.
4270	B: thank you, madam. have a nice drive!
4271	B: my condolences.
4272	A: nothing rang a bell.
4273	B: to be fair, though, both the costumes and scenery are marvelous.
4274	B: sounds pleasant.
4275	B: i guess so. i am badly off and i need this job.
4276	A: no problem at all.
4277	B: yes. no problem.
4278	B: this one fits me well but it is too expensive, can you make it a little cheaper?
4279	A: i see
4280	B: so tricky!
4281	A: thank you.
4282	B: i like the novels of dickens very much, i have reading almost all of them in chinese translation, i wish i can reading them in the original.
4283	B: coffee will be right with you.
4284	B: thanks.
4285	A: it's ok.
4286	A: i'm sure you will have fun no matter where you go.remember to take your bag.
4287	B: take it easy. it' s no good worrying. you were on your last leg if you keep worrying in this way.
4288	B: all right. see you tomorrow.
4289	B: never underestimate a woman when it comes to bargaining!
4290	B: i found some fairly major problems. a major support beam in the roof is broken, and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist.
4291	A: bye.
4292	B: watch your language or you'll be spending the weekend in your room.
4293	B: well. it's not my taste. would you please bring me a short sleeve?
4294	B: all right. let me get you something to drink.
4295	B: if you stayed up much later, you would see that just about every-thing closes around ten anyway.
4296	B: mysteries of the pyramids. didn't we watch this program last week?
4297	B: we can take it. just a moment ... please sign here.
4298	A: thanks, but i have to admit i am really good at bluffing!
4299	A: aright. i'll meet you there at one o'clock.
4300	B: no problem. thank you for being so understanding.
4301	B: being famous, i can do without, but i wouldn't mind being rich.
4302	A: see you.
4303	B: check the local time before you call. you don't want to wake your friend up by accident.
4304	B: you' re welcome.
4305	B: bye!
4306	A: um yeah. sorry about that.
4307	B: the problem is that many poor people might suffer.
4308	A: then you must know a lot about skating.
4309	B: yes, i'm really excited.
4310	A: alright. i'll have another drink.
4311	B: that would work out great! why don't we call and get a reservation?
4312	A: ok.now you can pick your fabric and pattern design. please follow me.
4313	B: same to you.
4314	A: yes. please sign your name at the bottom of the exchange receipt. thanks very much and here's your money.
4315	A: bye.
4316	A: i'm sure management is on top of it.
4317	B: did i mention she's good at cutting hair too?
4318	A: this one suits better. i will take it.
4319	B: i'll finish soon.
4320	B: you have good taste in music.
4321	B: ok, i' ll see you later.
4322	B: yes darling. you are quite right.
4323	A: it maybe worse than it seems.
4324	A: i hope so.
4325	B: see you later.
4326	B: oh, then it'll be one dollar twenty five cents. thank you.
4327	B: thank you.
4328	B: thank you very much.
4329	B: me too.
4330	B: i' m so sorry to hear that.
4331	B: see you.
4332	B: oh, it' s right downstairs. i'm going there myself. just follow me.
4333	B: no, why should i? i don' t feel like it. besides, i' m in such a bad mood.
4334	B: that' s perfect.
4335	B: sure. why don' t you sit down for a minute? you haven' t taken a rest all morning.
4336	B: thanks a lot.
4337	B: not too worry, so tell me about yourself.
4338	B: thank you. i suppose i should go to see a doctor.
4339	B: me too.
4340	B: well, you can check the local paper or search 'flea market ' online.
4341	A: i' m afraid a pencil won' t do. wait a moment, i' ll find you one.
4342	A: ok. here is your change. the train leaves on platform 8.
4343	B: oh, very close. maybe 5 minutes walk.
4344	B: 3 dollars.
4345	A: good idea.
4346	B: ok. i will catch you later.
4347	B: thanks. have a good one.
4348	A: right. i'll see if i can catch the waitress's eye.
4349	B: don't worry about it. i need to have something done about those bushes.
4350	B: because you're going to love this show!
4351	A: i like the country too. it's quite famous for its culture.
4352	B: all right. see you then.
4353	B: thank you. this place is nice.
4354	B: your approval would be my honor.
4355	B: i have no idea. it was completely out of the blue.
4356	A: this is a pity!
4357	B: just tell me what you'd like me to do.
4358	B: of course, this way please.
4359	B: let me see it! it's so small!
4360	B: in a minute, madam.
4361	B: it's ok, that's life.
4362	A: thank you.
4363	B: enough! if we don't finish the game, there won't be time for any movies tonight!
4364	B: that's right. she is pretty, but she wants to control everything in his life.
4365	A: sure.
4366	B: dad, that's all right. i don't think it will rain. and it doesn't make any sense to take that many things on a trip. besides i like to travel light. bye!
4367	B: not unless you want the matinee.
4368	A: let's go and try now!
4369	B: yes.
4370	B: yes, please let him know i would like to discuss the girard case with him.
4371	B: it's a football game the school team plays at home. the dance and reunions are usually that night, too.
4372	A: well, i know you do the right thing.
4373	A: i can' t wait to go there myself.
4374	B: your document will be ready in about ten minutes.
4375	B: sure. any time.
4376	B: i'm glad to hear that. i think it's the nicest city in the united states.
4377	B: just a moment, please, while i check. that's correct.you have a double room on the fifth floor.
4378	A: it is important to keep your mind up-to-date and active.
4379	B: i' ll come back for them tomorrow.
4380	B: i am afraid no. it is not covered by this insurance.
4381	A: exactly. instead of increasing their position, i want to increase yours.
4382	B: maybe i could have a try.
4383	B: i will enjoy seeing you; have a good week!
4384	A: i know, but i forgot to go to the bathroom before we left.
4385	A: thank you!
4386	B: all right. that sounds fair.
4387	B: ok. let's go.
4388	B: here you are.
4389	A: i cannot have the heart to do that.
4390	A: it was nice to meet you, too. and thanks for coming in today.
4391	A: loan me that tape recorder you have. and don't say anything to anyone until i come back.
4392	B: i completely agree with that.
4393	B: yet the argentine attacker is worth a bet.
4394	B: i like that joke, but i hope it's true.
4395	B: don' t mention it.
4396	B: they pay enough.
4397	B: we'll have to talk this over some more.
4398	B: forget it. it was an accident.
4399	B: looks good. i'll take it.
4400	B: sure. i just need to do one other job first. how about if i come up around 11:30?
4401	B: i'm afraid i'm not interested in fashion. there are so many other really important things in the world.
4402	A: sure, let' s just be friends.
4403	B: stick around and you'll get to know him better. he has a very unusual personality.
4404	A: so everybody's getting video mail.
4405	A: come on, grow up. have you seen vince around?
4406	B: a cold-wave, please.
4407	A: it's our pleasure. we are always happy to have another satisfied customer. thanks for calling. goodbye.
4408	B: it' s the worst thing i' ve ever tried.
4409	B: i' ll try to make it. i should be able to fit some time in around 3 o' clock.
4410	A: the idea of doing it at night is interesting. maybe i'll try it some day.
4411	B: sometimes it's difficult. some words look different from the way one pronounces them.
4412	B: thank you.
4413	B: right. i have lots of time to think carefully before i make my final decision.
4414	B: great. i'll see you on the 7th.
4415	A: you are welcome, jack. glad to be of help.
4416	B: that's a good idea.let ' s go!
4417	B: you' ll make more money that way.
4418	B: not funny.
4419	B: you' re welcome.
4420	A: home run by okapi! that puts this team ahead by two as we are at the bottom of the fifth inning here at richie stadium!
4421	A: that's very kind of you.
4422	B: don't rub it in. where am i going to put this huge thing?
4423	A: well, i have a lot of work. i'll see how it goes.
4424	B: thank you. oh, it tastes nice.
4425	A: that' s a good idea. i' m really looking forward to redoing my bedroom.
4426	A: i wouldn't either. it's been looking like rain for several days.
4427	A: have a pleasant stay.
4428	A: that comes to h. k. $ 120.
4429	B: well, it still hasn' t reached its destination. i wonder if you could track it down for us. mr. reynolds is a bit concerned.
4430	B: he makes me sick.
4431	B: no problem, sir. but it will cost you extra.
4432	A: thank you, sir. we look forward to serving you.
4433	B: sure, i'd love to. thank you.
4434	B: to a disco? oh, no. you know i hate pop.
4435	B: crouch down and try not to breathe in the smoke.
4436	A: i totally understand.
4437	B: no, honey, the balcony is full of boxes and things. i'm sorry.
4438	B: be careful, the cartridge can be very hot.
4439	A: good idea.
4440	B: but i think time can change everything.
4441	A: alright ... i get your point.
4442	B: i divided students into groups and asked them to generate their own ideas actively. it can help develop the problem-solving ability of the students.
4443	B: all right. have a good night.
4444	B: if things don' t get better in a few days, i will look for some other solutions.
4445	A: yes, i did. he only takes side with him. he seldom asks what dick is doing.
4446	B: i know that generally it is possible to move from this position to a management position with two years experience in the company
4447	A: then forgive her mistake.
4448	A: you don't have to keep saying that, yuri. it's not your fault.but me--i'm the one who should be sorry.it was me who suggested operations here in the first place! oh, what can we do?
4449	A: well, i collect beer mats. i' m not sure that counts, though.
4450	B: yes, there is. see you then.
4451	A: then i'll accept it with thanks.
4452	B: i' m excited to be here.
4453	A: i understand. thank you.
4454	A: as long as you have all of the documentation we require you have nothing to worry about.
4455	B: i would like to be able to work independently and take over some ordinary responsibilities such as answering routine correspondences, taking phone calls, and sometimes assisting you with personal business affairs.
4456	B: ok, but don't delay too long, or that trip will be all booked.
4457	B: it'll take you about 15 minutes.
4458	B: i hope it will be of some use.
4459	B: you should start from 1:30 pm in the afternoon.
4460	B: but it's raining.
4461	B: i am looking forward to returning to this restaurant.
4462	A: thank you so much. that's very kind of you.
4463	B: you're welcome. now smile ...
4464	B: all right.that sounds more interesting.
4465	B: i think i' ll be paying with cash.
4466	A: don't mention it. just a little thing i did.
4467	A: ok, sir. i will show you your table.
4468	A: thank you very much
4469	B: you' re a real friend in need.
4470	B: that' s a good point. car owners will probably be against it, but people who use public transport will be in favor of it.
4471	B: thanks a lot.
4472	B: wow. that's too much for me. don't you have anything cheaper?
4473	B: no, i think that i've had enough of this restaurant.
4474	A: that's it. how much?
4475	B: fine. as well, would you mind if i asked to see the loyd's surveyor report of your products? i may have a few more questions about your quality analysis.
4476	B: oh, that's the only place where jeans are not popular. i'd better just go home.
4477	A: dan, don't worry. i will tell her everything as soon as she comes back.
4478	B: it's easy! just go and get a card.
4479	B: sure, here you go.
4480	B: here is the menu.
4481	B: it sounds quite simple. next time when i travel abroad, i will apply for this kind of check too.
4482	B: ok, boy. i will buy it for you.
4483	B: that sounds simple enough. it's friday today, i'll be back on monday morning, first thing, with all of the relevant data. see you then, and enjoy your weekend.
4484	B: you' re welcome.
4485	A: that would be great! how about 2:30?
4486	A: i think that' s true with any of the fine arts.
4487	A: of course not!
4488	B: oh, it' s been uh ... fifteen minutes.
4489	B: i'd be happy to do something new.
4490	A: well, really! that was wonderful! i felt no pain at all. thank you, doctor.
4491	B: i think it' s because the manufactures are constantly bringing out new models. because they know that we will buy the new models, the appliances don' t need to last more than five or ten years at most.
4492	A: and i was overwhelmed by this scene, too.
4493	B: absolutely not! i'm not a thief.
4494	B: pardon? i can hardly hear you. i will call you later.
4495	A: we cannot expect politics to be true anyway.
4496	B: our profit margin is in the neighborhood of 20%.
4497	B: certainly, sir. we can wait another day or two.
4498	A: happy to know you, tim.
4499	A: thanks. i could eat a cow.
4500	B: sorry, i don't smoke.
4501	B: slacker and those who violate working principles.
4502	A: thank you, sir.
4503	A: hello? is the real taylor in there?
4504	A: alright. and i won't go to that cafe for awhile.
4505	A: i'll get them back right away.
4506	B: oh, i see, sir. we have the airline office inside the hotel. they have an english-speaking staff. just dial 35, please.
4507	B: gee, that's really nice of you.
4508	B: go do what you have to do, but make sure it doesn't happen again.
4509	B: are you kidding?
4510	B: it took three of us to move it.
4511	B: great, thanks a lot.
4512	B: yes, but don't worry. we'll make it.
4513	B: fine, mr. grant. thanks for your time.
4514	A: he is on the line.
4515	B: you can always look an extension up on the company website.
4516	A: i cant't believe it. you've worked here for years.
4517	A: i'm stuffed!
4518	A: don't be too critical.we can't expect it to be perfect.
4519	B: it can help you leave a deep impression on the interviewer.
4520	A: you bet!
4521	A: that's right.
4522	A: well, it's probably nothing serious.but i think we'd better have that shoulder x-rayed.we can't do the until the morning, though.so it'd be better if you stay in hospital for the night
4523	A: i'll have to write you a ticket and suspend your driver's license for 3 months.
4524	B: we started dating right away.
4525	A: at least we agree on that. let's go and get a drink.
4526	B: how do you spell it, sir?
4527	B: wow, must be interesting to watch dragon boats compete a-gainst one another on the city river.
4528	B: not at all, but you get what you pay for.
4529	B: have a good day at school! see you tonight!
4530	A: neither do i. i don't like any kind of modern dances all.
4531	B: when in rome, do as the romans do.
4532	B: oh, really?
4533	A: i see. how do i draw money from my news then.
4534	B: the style is all right, but i'm not sure about the color. let me think for a while.
4535	B: haha. wish you good luck.
4536	B: certainly.
4537	A: good bye.
4538	B: forgive me darling. i'm very tired.
4539	B: sure.
4540	B: forget it. it' s nothing.
4541	B: wow! you're right! this refrigerator is great. i'll take it.
4542	B: oh, you have too wild of an imagination.
4543	A: that' s good. we always need team players here.
4544	B: i've wanted to be involved in engineering ever since i was little. and my study has equipped me with a career as a mechanical engineer.
4545	B: that's right, i have to work.
4546	A: keep working hard, and then you will get another chance of promotion someday.
4547	B: i think i just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways.
4548	B: goodbye. thanks again.
4549	B: hell with it! nobody will give it an academy award!
4550	B: you're welcome, goodbye!
4551	B: i am so sorry to hear that. maybe you should go to the information counter over there. they can give you some advice.
4552	B: of course, but i'll have to go now.
4553	B: ok, i'll do them.
4554	A: sure.
4555	B: come on. i don't see any point in arguing about this. everyone has a right to his own opinion.
4556	B: thank you.
4557	A: everything was okay when it started, but the music made me drowsy. so i think i may have dozed off for a minute over there.
4558	B: thank god! a car's leaving. it's my turn!
4559	B: well, just because it's you. tomorrow, say around noon.
4560	B: me too. i get much more done when i am under the gun.
4561	B: yes, what's more, your company is one of the largest and best trading companies in this line of business.
4562	A: but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons.
4563	A: i'm afraid i haven't got a larger dress. this is the largest dress in the shop.
4564	A: bye!
4565	B: i hope so, too. bye! ben.
4566	A: i see. i guess i should be more careful about what i read, especially on the internet where you have no idea who anybody is.
4567	A: no, i' ve already been here for 3 interviews.
4568	B: well, go home and rest up. make sure you check the website for your assignments.
4569	B: same here.
4570	A: unemployment in my country is a fraction of that.
4571	A: you bet.
4572	A: good luck to them.
4573	B: i will try my best.
4574	A: yes, but i don't want my mom to tap my phone when i call clive.
4575	A: it will save you much time when you clear customs.
4576	B: i'm just not looking forward to cleaning it!
4577	B: really? let' s hit the road.
4578	B: that' s all right. bring me over what you' ve got.
4579	B: really? no, they couldn't. none of them would have jobs if they did.
4580	B: you're welcome.
4581	B: no. that' s all. thank you.
4582	B: i understand, sir. i' ll bring a doctor' s note in tomorrow. i am sorry, mr. douglas.
4583	B: that's smart thinking.
4584	A: thanks a lot.here.
4585	B: that' s fantastic. thank you.
4586	A: that's good answer. i appreciate your being frank.
4587	B: that' s all right.
4588	B: brazil calls for a time out and we' ll be right back, after a short commercial break.
4589	A: that's a good idea. let's discuss after work.
4590	B: it's much too hard for his age.
4591	A: yes. i'll pick you up first, and then we'll go get megan.
4592	A: well, i'm not sure of his name, but i know it's going to be his farewell performance.
4593	B: yes, i'm dating someone. her name is amanda.
4594	A: i' ll appreciate your help
4595	A: ok. let' s invite all their little friends to come and celebrate.
4596	A: that's not so bad.
4597	B: yes, maybe. but i like street shopping. there is more variety. i'm sorry. i just don't like malls.
4598	B: well, along with jurassic park! nice going, you got the right answer.
4599	B: no, thanks.
4600	B: everyone has a talent. they just need to find it.
4601	A: ok.
4602	B: travel.
4603	B: i preferred working with other colleagues when i worked in my previous company. i think teamwork and cooperation are very important. no matter how competent he or she is in a company, he can' t do without them.
4604	A: of course, sir. have a good day.
4605	B: good idea, especially at this price.
4606	A: of course. the brand is bird and it's famous for its quality.
4607	B: thanks for your help.
4608	B: he is afraid of his father-in-law.
4609	A: i see. well, there' s no rush. please send it via priority mail. please be extra careful, the contents of the package are fragile.
4610	A: i have a good solution ... we need some new blood! we should get rid of this president and boat in some new leaders!
4611	B: no problem.
4612	B: delighted i was able to help.
4613	B: i got it from an encyclopedia.
4614	B: yes, sir.
4615	A: thank you. i won' t miss it.
4616	B: it looks like you could use it. don' t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again.
4617	B: our personnel clerk will screen all the resumes that we receive, select the eligible ones and arrange the interview for them.
4618	B: all right. goodbye.
4619	B: don't worry.
4620	A: ok already. i'll try.
4621	A: i think as long as you try your best and don' t think of anything too much, everything will be all right.
4622	A: no, but i can't imagine that a girl like you would wonder to see a war movie.
4623	B: yeah. i can live with it. it' s great to be living alone.
4624	B: yes, there is. those organizations exist. you always can call a lawyer if you need legal help.
4625	B: maybe that's true. i don't know.but i'm sure in taiwan you have prescriptions too.
4626	A: let' s do it!
4627	A: that's great. thank you very much.
4628	B: well, i was looking in this magazine the other day and cruises are not very expensive at all. take a look at this!
4629	B: at the close of escrow, the house will be yours!
4630	A: you're welcome.
4631	A: yeah, china's developing so fast and development opportunities can be found almost in every corner of the country.
4632	A: come and see me again in a month's time. i think you'll be a different man!
4633	A: you made a good choice.
4634	B: i don't think i share your view there.the writer is writing about history, society, human nature and so on.it ' s too hard to understand.
4635	A: oh, i see.
4636	B: ok, let's do that, even though we may have to take a longer way.
4637	B: i won't, mum.
4638	B: that sounds good.
4639	B: i'm sorry, but the price is final.
4640	B: here you go. thank you very much.
4641	A: i couldn' t possibly hire you. you can' t take shorthand, you can' t use a computer, and you can only work part time.
4642	A: enjoy yourself.
4643	A: i agree. i appreciate your helping me.
4644	A: i'm really sorry.
4645	A: really? so your city does have some old history after all.
4646	B: thank you. i appreciate the compliment.
4647	B: i need size 41.
4648	B: i don' t know what other people think, but i, for one, envy only children!
4649	B: it's a black leather one.there are my credit card and id and some money.
4650	B: i' m staying right where i' m at.
4651	A: thanks, but actually i was hoping i could ask you to write my biography.
4652	A: typical you, always wanting to keep the best things for yourself. the more i appreciate the gift now.
4653	B: i' ll be glad if you would.
4654	A: goodbye.
4655	B: thank you.
4656	B: but anyway, i'll have a try.
4657	B: thank you so much, mr addison.
4658	B: no problem.
4659	A: oh, i' m crazy about them.
4660	A: maybe he shouldn' t come to collage, he should become a football star.
4661	A: i can assure you that such a thing today will never happen again in future delivery. we have made the plan to improve the package of our exported goods.
4662	B: be yourself and be honest. simply answer the questions put to you.
4663	B: oh, that sounds nice. i' d love to.
4664	B: okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time.
4665	B: yes, that's it.
4666	B: both, but the rules of playing cards vary in different places.
4667	B: don't worry. everything will go well. i promise!
4668	B: even if they break down, they're still works of art.
4669	B: you can talk with him.
4670	B: i see. i have run as fast as i can.
4671	A: yes, sir.
4672	B: no, it will be another hour.
4673	B: it's easy. if you do exercise everyday, you can make it, too.
4674	B: the same to you. keep in touch.
4675	B: all right. you can rest assured that we will do everything possible to advance shipment. the fertilizers will be delivered before april.
4676	B: ok, that would be great.
4677	A: i buy a national newspaper sometimes, buy i nearly always buy a local evening newspaper. i find the local news more interesting than national or international news.
4678	B: last night he told the children a cliff-hanger story and both of them were scared out of sleep.
4679	B: well, i just wanted to say well done. really you did a great job.
4680	B: thank you. i will.
4681	B: my poor memory. thank you very much.
4682	B: that's wonderful.
4683	B: ok.
4684	A: thanks.
4685	B: i am just casting pearls before swine.
4686	B: thank you.
4687	B: it starts at 11am in the morning.
4688	B: i said you can trust him. you just have to believe it.
4689	A: perhaps i'll agree with mike. i couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom i'd never met before.
4690	B: i'm positive, ms. chen.
4691	A: that's what the weatherman said last night.
4692	B: you know, next week, we' ll hold a football match. our cheering squad is busy rehearsing the programmes for it
4693	B: yes, i did. i had a fine time.
4694	B: it seems all right. do you have pantaloons?
4695	B: ok, thank you.
4696	B: that's fine. let me get your meat.
4697	B: thanks. things are going to be different now.
4698	B: yes, it was quite a long flight. i'm glad to finally be here.
4699	B: here you go. look in this flyer, or check with the produce person.
4700	B: that's true.just hope wendy can recover from the pain of divorce soon.
4701	B: ok, thank you.
4702	A: yeah, i got to eat as much pizza as i could for free.
4703	A: i am sorry, it's out of stock right now.
4704	B: it's just around the corner
4705	A: ok. good. i want two side by side tickets in the economy cabinet. thank you.
4706	A: ok. dad! i'm coming.
4707	B: thanks for the warning! see you tomorrow!
4708	A: we have some inspections, but it is very hard to avoid pollution when extracting oil. there has been some damage, but it is under control.
4709	B: ok, i'll take one.
4710	A: well, don't blame me! i never get a chance to watch tv.
4711	B: you should've called in sick! next time, have either of your parents call the school office.
4712	A: wow, you're not kidding. hold on a second. hello, could you give us a hand, please?
4713	B: i will be there for three years.
4714	B: you can get dressed as soon as the film is processed. we will be all done here.
4715	B: thanks, karen.
4716	B: till the end of the month.
4717	B: how about this? they're the same shape.
4718	B: oh. what good is that? i thought it gave you free money.
4719	A: thank you, david.
4720	A: thank you.
4721	A: ok.
4722	A: i like to stick to the clean stuff, like vodka, gin, white rum and other clear spirits.
4723	A: that's a good idea!
4724	B: but i am her brother, not her servant.
4725	B: well, i can't help.
4726	B: i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary. i'd like to postpone that decision until later.
4727	B: no constipation. everything seems ok.
4728	B: it doesn't seem to be so easy.
4729	B: i see what you mean. that was pretty easy after all.
4730	B: a debit card will be fine.
4731	B: that' s the way to go.
4732	B: forget it. it was an accident.
4733	B: sorry.
4734	A: yes, maybe i should.
4735	B: i think that we should let someone know. they will probably want to fix the problem.
4736	B: i'm honored that you think i would be qualified. but i would really have to think about this first.
4737	B: so do i. this is broadway.there are lots of theaters. this way leads to times square.
4738	A: maybe they will send me e-mail to inform the result. let me check my mail-box again.
4739	A: i' m sure they will.
4740	B: good luck!
4741	B: it was raining when i left new york.
4742	A: it should be around 5 working days, but different cases take different times. sorry i can't be more precise.
4743	A: you are absolutely right. they are too brief. they don't tell you anything.
4744	A: ok, i will remember.
4745	A: yeah! remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth?
4746	B: i used to work for a shipping company for six years, and i am quite familiar with some managers. would your like to meet them?
4747	B: brings back memories?
4748	A: ok.give me his number and we'll contact him.
4749	B: all right, then let's begin.
4750	B: yes, you're right, it does. but we believe it's less harmful to the environment than landfill
4751	B: i thought you'd never ask. the lawn needs to be mowed and the garage deserves to be cleaned.
4752	B: ok, i'll take it.
4753	A: i didn' t pay attention to that.
4754	B: congratulations on your first voting day.
4755	A: i'm honored to know you.
4756	A: pretty good. actually, i'm quite busy with work. by the way, say ' hello ' to your husband.
4757	A: i'm sorry, but i can't! that's something my grandmother would sing!
4758	B: the accounts department, no problem. i'm just putting you through now.
4759	B: what for?
4760	A: yes, that'll be fine. how much is this going to cost?
4761	A: yes, i do. leave me alone!
4762	B: they should fill in an application form, hand in the copies of identification card and household register.
4763	B: that's the point.
4764	A: ok.
4765	B: let me see. yes, they are perfectly matched!
4766	B: i know. but i just can't stand her butting in when i was trying to emphasize a point.
4767	A: go ahead, have a try and be a joke.
4768	B: really? he looks so young.
4769	B: there's a bookstore just across the street.
4770	B: yeah, i crave my own space. i just get so tiredhaving people around me all the time. we all need our private space. but i also think interpersonal skills very important. living in a dorm means you have to learn to be considerate of others, otherwise nobody is going to have a good time.
4771	B: oh, as simple as that! i shall never wait for a real person again, these machines are wonderful.
4772	B: thank you and bye-bye!
4773	B: that sounds dreadful!
4774	A: that's great.
4775	B: no! it's a perfect fit!
4776	A: you' re right. i' ll save the beer for when we land. one orange juice, please.
4777	A: not for soft drinks. but we charge ten yuan for each alcohol order.
4778	B: the funds are all ready to go in my personal account, so let's transfer it.
4779	B: thank you, ma'am. it's been a pleasure doing business with you.
4780	B: i can do that.
4781	A: thank you. the same to you.
4782	B: that's correct. we have four seasons of spring.
4783	A: that's what everyone says! i can't wait to see it for myself some day.
4784	B: definitely. i really like italian food.
4785	B: of course, i like it very much. thank you.
4786	B: i wish you the best of luck.
4787	B: ok, dear sister, i see. this kind of thing will not happen again.
4788	B: bring me the menu, please.
4789	A: open your mouth and show me your tongue. say ah ... you have a bad cold. so you must stay in bed for a week.
4790	B: unfortunately, i missed a chance to see a classic movie.
4791	B: no, i don't like action movies because i'm cultured!
4792	B: 626-555-1739. thank you for doing business with us, mr. sandals.
4793	B: i can live with that too.
4794	A: sounds exciting. i can't wait.
4795	B: yes, i'm the third child.
4796	A: yes. but not for about 2 weeks.
4797	A: the beans will burn. i know. i've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck!
4798	A: i like renaldo the most.
4799	B: john.
4800	B: fine. see you later.
4801	A: yes, but he' s got a wife and 3 children as well.
4802	B: i hope that the test results show me to be really healthy.
4803	B: good to see you too!
4804	B: oh, did you? thanks a lot.
4805	B: that shouldn't be a problem.
4806	B: thanks. i will.
4807	B: i have no idea.
4808	A: yes, you have 2 weeks paid vacation a year, and you get it additional week after 4 years, and then again, after 9 years if you decide to stay that long, we promote from within based on performance, so there is an excellent chance that you could become a sales manager or even a regional manager.
4809	A: then we can take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the park.
4810	B: sure, no problem.
4811	B: wow, it is quite far away from here. i'm afraid you're gonna have to take bus no. 713.
4812	B: you're lucky.
4813	B: actually, i' ve eaten soup dumplings in a lovely restaurant on nanjing lu. they were delicious!
4814	A: nowadays, it's no difference from america. but in old times, we have traditional ways to celebrate it.
4815	B: that's right. it could last six months or more. this model's designed for heavy use. don't worry - you'll get an error message telling you when to change the head.
4816	B: ok, let's go.
4817	B: as you know, my city is on the coast.the water is also not clean.but people still go swimming all year around. i prefer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot in sunny.
4818	A: good. i'll come back in the evening.
4819	A: the leopard print sounds fabulous. ok, i'll take it.
4820	A: yes, i have.
4821	B: alright. i'll have a cup of tea waiting for you.
4822	A: well, have it your way.
4823	B: me either, but i' m dealing with it anyway.
4824	B: yes, there is. see you then.
4825	B: tomorrow afternoon would be fine.
4826	B: no problem, i can wait.
4827	A: that's all right.
4828	A: well, as we say, the rest is history ...
4829	B: no. i can text the address to you if you are not clear about it
4830	A: here 's the check for hen dollars
4831	A: you can say that again. the government must open it' s eyes to the fact.
4832	B: thank you so much. you're an expert.
4833	A: coing out for a walk.
4834	B: the cops arrested him before he could even make it out the door.
4835	A: there are times of games planned, should have a grand time.
4836	A: ok, i will do it right now.
4837	B: i'll make sure to get it tomorrow.
4838	B: oh dear. well, if it has to be done, then it has to be done.
4839	B: in a while, crocodile.
4840	B: i'll put the song at the front of the list.
4841	B: ok. we'll wait.
4842	A: a piece of cake. you'll be successful.
4843	B: absolutely. she's a teacher of aerobics.
4844	B: i was looking forward to your arrival.
4845	B: great. i'll wait right here, thanks.
4846	A: ok. don't forget to get your ticket three days ahead.
4847	B: just joking, t. i've got some wonderful clothes. let's go and have a close look at your outfit.
4848	B: thank you, you are so thoughtful. i think i could use some beers right now.
4849	B: i'd call him and dump him now! you deserve better than him!
4850	B: you are really a wet blanket.
4851	B: your room number is 505. this is your key. the bellboy will help you with the baggage.
4852	A: my mind is made up.
4853	B: you are right. i won't cry anymore.
4854	B: i almost forget.
4855	B: i have faith in our new president.
4856	A: yeah, it was nice to meet you. hope i run into you again sometime.
4857	A: yeah, i' ll try to do the same. so, i was wondering you wanna go out to dinner friday night?
4858	B: okay, here's a new one for you.
4859	A: you'd better bring the diploma, identification card and several copies of your resume.
4860	B: i think we should go over there and see if we can apply for that program.
4861	B: you really do a good job.
4862	B: that' s it for today. thank you.
4863	A: that's understood.
4864	B: oh, no.on the contrary, there are many beautiful days, especially in the spring and fall.
4865	B: let me know if you need anything else.
4866	A: now you know you have to clean your bathtub every time when you use it.
4867	B: i know, janet. i just walked out and forgot it completely. i' ll go home and get it at noon, all right?
4868	B: i still think nobody plays for nothing.
4869	B: what! how am i supposed to get to school or go shopping? this is not happening!
4870	B: about half a year.
4871	B: okay, i'll give you a ring next week.
4872	A: no, thanks.
4873	B: ok. i'll wait here for you.
4874	A: you are welcome.
4875	B: you won't be late.it ' s still early.
4876	B: yeah. he has no one to count on.
4877	B: i get it now.
4878	B: oh, that's the very thing i need.
4879	B: to be honest, in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place, we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment.
4880	B: thanks. i appreciate it.
4881	B: it's $ 9.95. do you want me to put it in a box?
4882	B: i never trust those stupid doctors.
4883	A: we could give you an uncite office, as well as potential to develop your own contracts in japan.at the same time, after helping with our project, we will be willing to split our profit with you.
4884	B: maybe you' re right.
4885	A: thank you very much.
4886	A: nice meeting you, too.
4887	A: let's congratulate him on sunday.
4888	A: okay by me.
4889	A: no problem, sir.
4890	B: thanks a lot. i expect to see your name nominated pretty soon too. you' ve been doing some great work.
4891	A: all right, doctor. but it really hurts.
4892	A: you should know about the oil crisis.
4893	A: you will spoil him.
4894	B: thank you.
4895	A: $ 100. but we will charge you $ 200 as a deposit.
4896	A: well, thank you very much, i hope i can find it.
4897	B: anyway, we are arriving at danshui soon. i can't wait to watch the beautiful sunset.
4898	A: ok. i will bring it for you.
4899	B: that' s great. thanks very much. would you like a cup of tea or coffee?
4900	A: no problem, miss.
4901	B: i'll think about it after i start feeling better. right now, i don't even want to hear the word snowboarding.
4902	B: once you pay it, your record will be cleared.
4903	A: that's a good idea. you are really creative.
4904	B: that' s right, plus the activation fee, the emergency services fee, the monthly service fee, oh, and any charges for extra minutes, and ...
4905	A: see you tomorrow.
4906	B: here's your ticket.
4907	B: ok. i'd like to say that i've really enjoyed working with you.however, i think you should work harder at your new job and then you can ask for higher pay.
4908	A: you bet. the wrestlers had got sound defences and they simply couldn't make it.
4909	B: good-bye!
4910	A: sure. if we can get an appointment with someone to do the floors, we should probably be able to have the furniture in here after a week or so. i can get all the carpet out this weekend.
4911	B: oh, yes. that's just the one i want. i will take it.
4912	A: that's all right.
4913	B: for instance, some products that do very well in tokyo branch are a flop in malaysia.we ' re talking about different people with different lifestyles and different needs. each of the branches takes these types of things into consideration when they compile their reports and their marketing plans.
4914	B: mm. in hundreds, please.
4915	B: look, is that tom?
4916	B: your new apartment can be recarpeted and repainted by next tuesday.
4917	A: thanks very much. i appreciate it.
4918	B: oh, why didn't you say so then? but i still think we've made a good buy.
4919	B: i'm surfing the net.
4920	B: i see.
4921	A: you have an account with us, right? if so, there shouldn't be any problem.
4922	B: i'm already dialing, sir.
4923	B: i agree with you. only in this way can we ease the traffic problems.
4924	B: i mean he's a student developing all round.
4925	A: okay. have it your way, but don't say i didn't warn you.
4926	B: i bet nobody will care about it.
4927	B: yes, i can give you a reservation on that.
4928	B: they' re really running you into the ground. why don' t you ask for some time off? you could take a long weekend and go away somewhere.
4929	B: i've got a date.
4930	A: ah, thanks.
4931	B: that will be fourteen dollars in all.
4932	B: that' s ok. thanks.
4933	A: you should always keep in mind, the more you practice, the better english you can speak.
4934	B: thank you, i'll try again later.
4935	B: thank you very much. i hope you enjoy your stay.
4936	A: the beans will burn. i know. i've tasted burnt coffee before ... yuck!
4937	A: i know. it' s always nice to have some closure, but i don' t think you' ll have a problem finding another girlfriend.
4938	B: my new plan is to wait for the end of the sand storm and clean my apartment.
4939	A: fair enough!
4940	B: no, thanks.
4941	B: yeah, i think it will be wonderful.
4942	B: maybe we could try it again in a few months when things have settled down.
4943	B: well, thanks. i will come again this afternoon, then.
4944	B: think nothing of it.
4945	B: i apologize, sir. just a second, while i transfer you to my supervisor.
4946	B: thanks. i appreciate that.
4947	B: indeed.he ' s strict with himself, too.we can see every lecture of his is well-prepared.
4948	B: don't worry about the cost. our insurance policy covers us against situations like this. we need those parts urgently. could you please try to get them here tomorrow?
4949	B: that's cool. i've heard la has an all-asian channel on cable.
4950	B: i'm sure of what i'm doing.
4951	B: check and double check.
4952	B: no, why should i? i don' t feel like it. besides, i' m in such a bad mood.
4953	B: the only thing i can do now is waiting for another chance.
4954	A: yeah, after all the explanations like, it' s too heavy, i was in a hurry ... whatever.
4955	A: so, your experience is as impressive in practice as it is on paper.
4956	A: i will keep my room clean, too. that's a promise.
4957	B: maybe you are right.
4958	A: bye. see you.
4959	A: i'm fine for now, thanks.
4960	B: yes, if i get worse, i will definitely look for extra help with this.
4961	B: ok. let' go back to the hotdog stand.
4962	B: your dream will come true.it ' s really breathtaking.
4963	B: yes, of course. it's really worth visiting.
4964	A: it' s an anniversary of our weeding.
4965	A: no, i'm fine. thank you.
4966	A: how do you want to your mustache trimmed?
4967	A: sure. now it's all right. here is your boarding pass and label. have a nice trip.
4968	B: that' s not right, somebody should do something.
4969	B: same problem here. there's an 18 - year gap between the oldest and youngest child in my family. the last child was born just as the oldest was going to college.
4970	A: see you.
4971	B: thanks. i'll put it in a safe place.
4972	A: ok, you're through now.
4973	A: no thank you. i' d like to send it just by normal post.
4974	B: out of the frying pan and into the fire.
4975	B: my boots? er ... sure, ok.
4976	B: i am in charge of marketing activities in south-east asia, for example, organizing trade conferences and arranging exhibitions.
4977	B: yes please. and i' d like to be able to make video calls too.
4978	B: i'll give it a try.
4979	A: that' s okay. i' ll call back later.
4980	B: how did you know! they say listening to classical music can make your baby smarter!
4981	B: not long actually. so i'm sure i will learn a lot from our cooperation.
4982	B: no, thank you. i have brought some.
4983	B: it is. i hope you' ll have time to come for a visit soon. you really should come during the summer, when the weather is better and there' s more happening outdoors.
4984	B: if so, i'd better try another store.
4985	A: thanks, goodbye.
4986	B: wait. this is sounding like a major list. why don't you just come with me?
4987	B: well, i don't know what else you could do then. do you think bribing them with chocolate would work?
4988	A: and about time too.
4989	B: thank you, doctor.
4990	A: i' ll look for a ticket for you, too. thanks!
4991	B: international air braking systems.
4992	A: that's where the shoe pinches.
4993	A: ok. that sounds like a deal.
4994	B: then why don' t we go for a walk in the hills. it' d be very good for us you know.
4995	A: poor guy! it will take him a long time to get back on his feet.
4996	B: thank you.
4997	A: oh. i' m sorry to hear that. what happened?
4998	A: i'm always feeling hungry.
4999	B: i' ve done that. the doctor advised me to cut out smoking and drinking.
5000	A: year! they are unreliable sometimes.

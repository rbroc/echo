'Before the World Cup I showed him videos of Marc Overmars because he reminded me of him,' said Rooney. 'He has the potential to be as good as Overmars. Bright future: Raheem Sterling was England's best player during Wednesday's 1-0 win against Norway . Similar: Wayne Rooney believes Sterling (left) shares some of the same qualities as Marc Overmars (right) Captain material: Rooney (left) has admitted showing Sterling videos of Overmars before the World Cup . Danger man: Overmars scared opposition defenders with his pace and trickery in attacking areas . 63.6% - England’s win percentage against Switzerland. They have won 14 of their 22 contests, drawing five and losing just three. They are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the Swiss. 1 - Good news for Roy Hodgson — England have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home. 192 - Some bad news for Hodgson. In 192 minutes of football, England have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot. 3 - Wayne Rooney looks a good bet to score at any time. The England captain has scored in each of his three appearances against Switzerland. 2 - Only two players have survived from England’s last game against the Swiss — Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere both started that match at Wembley in 2011. 17 - England like playing in Basel. They have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game. That includes an 8-1 victory in 1963. 9 - Switzerland have not lost at home for nine matches. Their last defeat on home soil came against Romania in May 2012. Andrew Magee . 'Raheem is a fantastic and quite an unusual player. He can play right across the front line, out wide. Although he's a small lad, he's really strong. The potential he's shown is incredible. He'll be a massive player for us over the next 10 to 15 years and, unfortunately, for Liverpool.' Overmars had terrifying speed and a clinical instinct. Sterling arguably has a greater range of weaponry, but is still only 19 and developing. He is, nevertheless, the brightest spark in Hodgson's post-World Cup gloom. At the St Jakob-Park stadium here on Monday night, England will look to him for creativity. Four years ago, Fabio Capello's England arrived at the same stadium in similar circumstances. The World Cup in South Africa had gone badly and this was the first test for his team away from Wembley. Rooney was mired in front-page scandal at the time but he responded with the opening goal in a 3-1 win, which put Capello in control on the road to Euro 2012. Hodgson could do with the same on his return to Switzerland, where he is still feted for taking them to their first World Cup finals in 28 years in 1994. 'Winning this game does not make a great team in 2016,' said Hodgson. 'Neither does losing it make us a poor team in 2016. We are not in an embryonic stage — we are carrying on — but it is an early stage. We have to make sure after these next two years we are very, very strong.' Wednesday's 1-0 home win over Norway was not enough in itself to settle the anxieties that emerged in Brazil. It is nearly two years since England actually beat any of the teams who qualified for the World Cup. Pivotal moment: Wayne Rooney scores from the penalty spot in England's 1-0 win against Norway . Challenges: Roy Hodgson will be without Daniel Sturridge and potentially Jordan Henderson on Monday . Preparation: Hodgson leads his players in training at St Jakob-Park in Basle on Sunday afternoon . As ever, injuries have eaten into the squad. Striker Daniel Sturridge's withdrawal on Friday was more damaging than the loss of midfield rookie Jack Colback or back-up keeper Ben Foster but at least Hodgson has Danny Welbeck ready to step in. If Jordan Henderson is not fit after twisting an ankle in training on Sunday night it will bring another thorny problem — not least because England have brought only 17 outfield players — and challenge Hodgson's theory that the nation is producing a breed of footballer no longer bound by positions. 'Very few are classic number nines, or tens or sevens or fours or sixes,' Hodgson said. 'They're not stereotyped. They're capable of different things. I've seen the Under-20s play twice and when you watch them you do see a way in which English football is changing. I think back to the academy at Blackburn 20 years ago and the type of players coming through now are different. 'It's difficult to look at an England team at any level and find a player who is not pacey, even a centre back. In the past we had stereotypical players who got by on the quality of their play. Not now.' By the same token, he likes to think the style of his team is less predictable. 'The players we have are very different to the ones we had in 2012,' the manager added. 'We were a passing team. Now we're a dribbling team. We're not a long-ball team any more. We try to pass through the midfield and create openings. We're athletic and pacey and technique is getting better.' Hodgson refuted the accompanying theory that a 67-year-old coach might not be best-equipped to coach such modern footballers. Stepping up: Danny Welbeck looks set to start for the Three Lions after an injury to Daniel Sturridge . Settling : Sterling (left) and his team-mates get used to the pitch on which they will face Switzerland . All smiles: Arsenal team-mates Calum Chambers (left) and Jack Wilshere (centre) share a joke in training . England will play on a Monday for only the 10th time in 45 years when they face Switzerland next week. UEFA have spread out the qualification matches for EURO 2016 as part of their new ‘Week of Football’ concept, with games taking place from Thursday to Tuesday. That means 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per cent in 2012 qualifying. The final set of fixtures in each group — scheduled for October 2015 — will still kick off simultaneously. England have only played nine Monday games since 1966, but prior to that they were a regular occurrence. Between 1880 and 1927, England played Wales alone 33 times on a Monday. The good news for England fans is their record is good... P...55  W...37  D...11  L...7 Win %...67.3 . 'Either you're a good coach or you're not,' he rapped back. 'Either you know how to put your approach across or not. You just try to make sure the best players are in important places, and those around them complement them. That's how it's been since I started. I don't see any difference at all now to that.' And so, to the puzzle of where precisely to deploy Sterling, who was so impressive at the tip of a diamond in the final 20 minutes against Norway, after Rooney had been replaced. Does he keep him there or move him back to the wing, albeit with freedom to float? The team practised with the diamond midfield at times last week while at St George's Park and, in the absence of Sturridge, England can more easily revert to 4-2-3-1 without threatening Rooney's place. 'There are options,' said Hodgson. 'It's up to us to perform and play well. Is it enough to come here and play 10 behind the ball and sneak a 0-0? No, I'd say it isn't.'\n",

## Hugging Face Token for Llama 2 
To use Meta´s `llama2`, you need to request access by accepting Meta´s terms and conditions (follow instructions at https://huggingface.co/meta-llama).

After having succesfully requested access, you have to place a Hugging Face token called `hf_token.txt` within this folder (files within this folder should be ignored by Git). 
Read more about HF tokens at https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens (a `read` token should be enough for the project's purpose!).

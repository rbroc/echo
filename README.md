### Running the code

The easiest way is to clone the repo and run the setup script to create a virtual environment and install packages:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

You can then extract metrics from all of the data using the second bash script:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

The pipeline requries  *Python3.11* - it should work down to *3.9*, but hasn't been tested.

rolling out her video for the released-in-december \"army of love\" with video diaries building up to a december 22 premiere. \"it's like euro trash meets angels singing in a choir,\" kerli said of \"army of love,\" which continues to draw interest online because of the video, which has a curious mix of swirling melodies set against striking visuals (the clip was shot in estonia). adventurous college radio listeners have long been boosters of acts from the baltic states and other european countries, but mainstream pop fans rarely hear singers such as kerli on the u.s. pop charts. and while european artists who have \"made it\" overseas have been buying second homes in the hollywood hills for decades, more interesting are the new pop singers living nearby, such as slovakia's twiins, who are hoping against odds to make a name for themselves in america after a modicum of success elsewhere. the duo, who are identical twins, moved to l.a. last year. they are currently working on their first record for l.a.-based indie label b records with known u.s. producers including bryan todd, who has worked with names such as jordin sparks. \"we love los angeles because of the weather, nice people and shopping, but the main reason why we moved is our work,\" veronika nízlové said via email last month. her twin sister daniela added the transition has not been easy. \"it's really hard to come from eastern europe and try to achieve success in america. we are not native speakers, we are not americans...it's a little disadvantage to us, but our big advantage is that we are twins. \" twiins, which scored a minor european hit last year with a remake of sabrina salerno's 1980s hit \"boys,\" seem already savvy to the city's sometimes cruel undercurrent. in their forthcoming single \"welcome to hollywood,\" the pair warn other aspiring singers that not everything is sunshine and smiles in the city of angels. \"the song is not about the perfect hollywood,\" veronika said, \"it's about people with their 'friendly faces' which is far from being true. you should have open eyes and be careful whom you trust. hollywood and all that goes along with it really has two sides to it.\" sage advice from los angeles' latest émigrés, who sing on their soon-to-be released single: \"welcome to hollywood\/boy you better give it up before it gets you down\/welcome to hollywood\/just got to get a grip of how to get around.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":"  The article discusses the increasing number of European pop singers moving to Los Angeles to pursue their careers in the US music industry. The city has traditionally been seen as a hub for aspiring actors and actresses, but now singers from countries such as Estonia, Italy, Russia, and Slovakia are flocking to LA to make it big. These artists are drawn by the city's diverse culture and the opportunity to collaborate with other creatives. However, the article also highlights the challenges faced by these singers, including the language barrier and the difficulty of breaking into the US market. Despite these challenges, many of these singers are finding success, with some even buying billboards on Sunset Boulevard to promote themselves. The article features Kerli, a former winner of a Baltic version of \"American Idol,\" who moved to LA four years ago and has been slowly winning over American fans. Her debut album sold around 65,000 copies, and she is now working on her follow-up full-length record. Other singers mentioned in the article include Twiins, a Slovakian duo who moved to LA last year and are working on their first record with known US producers. The article concludes by highlighting the sage advice from these singers, who warn other aspiring artists to be careful whom they trust in Hollywood and to have open eyes to the city's sometimes cruel undercurrent."}

'we wanted to make sure we kept the jury focused on the conduct that led to these people's sickness, but not let the case get into the medical history of every victim out there' with testimony on individual deaths, moore said. defense attorneys have acknowledged the georgia plant shipped tainted peanut butter and covered up positive salmonella tests, but they say the scheme was carried out behind the backs of the parnell brothers by two plant managers who pleaded guilty. the three defendants, charged with 71 total counts, still face severe punishment if convicted. prosecutors have said stewart parnell faces a maximum of 754 years in prison and $17 million in fines. and moore said he intends to present evidence of the deaths during sentencing if there are convictions. the centers for disease control and prevention, which tracked the outbreak from victims back to the plant, determined 714 people got sick in 43 u.s. states. three deaths were reported in minnesota, two in ohio, two in virginia, one in idaho and one in north carolina. but the cdc hedged when tying fatalities to salmonella.

He argued that a Labour-led government alone would \"wreck\" the economy, but that the Lib Dems could help to \"finish the job\" of repairing the economy begun in partnership with David Cameron. Clegg also predicted that there will be more coalitions in the future, as both Labour and the Conservatives will have to draw up a \"shopping list\" of policies for manifestoes.\nThe conference was marred by high winds and heavy rain, which made it difficult for delegates to reach the venue. Clegg braved the cold as he walked to the BBC studios in Glasgow this morning, and many delegates were not well-prepared for the weather.\nVicky Pryce, a former wife of disgraced Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne, also criticized the party's plans for a \"mansion tax,\" which she argued is a \"myth\" that will not provide a significant source of income for the government. Pryce dismissed the idea of a mansion tax, which has been blocked by the Conservatives, as an \"arbitrary\" and \"unjustified\" tax that will not address the economic challenges facing the country.\nOverall, Clegg's speech focused on the Lib Dems' role in government and their plans for the next election, while Pryce's article criticized the party's proposals for a \"mansion tax\" and argued that there are other, more effective ways to address the economic challenges facing the country."}

'harry gets right in there and is pretty fearless when he plays, just like his personality. 'they say they love polo but can’t play as much as they’d like. they’re very sporty.' the princes’ team won 5-4 in the last few minutes of their game, with the event attended by a host of england celebrities including dame helen mirren and clive owen. alec couldn’t believe  the brothers, who introduced themselves casually as ‘will and harry’, were so normal. alec brown is a professional polo player, living in england and argentina for six months of the year. he grew up on his family property in nsw's upper hunter valley, with his grandparents and parents breeding and training polo horses . ‘i didn’t expect them to be the same as anyone else. 'my mouth was open most of the time. i was really nervous and i didn’t know what to ask them at first!'’ alec says that the duke of cambridge was particularly interested in alec’s australian background. ‘will said that he loved his time in australia but was so flat out. he said he wishes he’d had more time to relax and take it in. 'will said hopefully he can get back to australia soon. he also spoke about george about how much he’s loving his dad role.’ alec (right) says harry was lots of fun, making fun of his brother, the duke of cambridge for 'being whipped' alec said his  encounter with the princes was ‘a matter of right place, right time.’ ‘i was playing that day and my friend got injured,' he said. ‘he’s an english player who represents england. he asked me to replace him for his afternoon game with will and harry so of course i did it!' despite his incredible experiences overseas, alec cherishes the time he gets to return to the family property in scone, in the upper hunter valley north of sydney. alec spending four months of the year in england and two in argentina playing polo. ‘it’s so good to get home after the long english season and to play in the local comp down in scone,' he said. ‘it’s great to be back where it all started. spending six months of the year living out of suitcases might seem like an amazing lifestyle but it is a job and you do miss home and your family and friends.’ alec, will and jasper come from a family property, belltrees, which breeds polo horses, as the boys come from a long line of polo enthusiasts. the ‘three whites’ say the scone local junior polo school is where their passion for polo began. they are returning to compete in scone's 'polo in the paddock' competition in a couple of weeks, to be held on their home turf in the upper hunter valley country town, which is expected to be a great weekend attended by players and spectators. alec and his cousins jasper and will grew up on the family property, belltrees and are now all international professional polo players . it's a rare opportunity for the three cousins to play on the same team. ‘we all went our different ways and worked for different people so we’re always playing against each other, which is not so much fun,' alec said. ‘we only get to play with each other when we come back to scone.’ although alec has always loved the sport, he only entertained the thought of pursuing polo professionally during his gap year. he spent the year at belltrees, after finishing boarding school at the king’s school in sydney. ‘i really got the polo bug when i was about 19 though during my year at home. ‘i decided to go overseas to england when i was 20 and have been going back and forth for four years.’ alec says it’s a ‘massive help’ to have his cousins playing polo in england alongside him. ‘i’ve lived with will this year in england and it was amazing to have that support. someone close you can rely on and who know what you’re going through. 'we’re under a lot of pressure to perform so it’s great to have someone there who you can ask for opinions.' alec brown (far left) hopes to see how far he can go competing professionally, before he returns to breed and train high-level polo horses . ‘grandma is literally the driving force of our whole family, she’s amazing. she lives at the belltrees homestead herself but brings the whole family together. 'the family breeds polo horses... the plan is to see how far i can get competing, and then come home to breed and train high-level polo horses.' alec thinks the australian countryside is incredibly beautiful and the cliche is true - there's no place like home. 'i’m lucky to have played at most clubs in the world but there aren’t many that have such a great atmosphere. 'the scone polo club has the traditional country vibe where people come together who love the sport, love horses and have a good weekend and a good experience.' he's looking forward to seeing the princes again when he returns to england - particularly party boy harry. 'i’ll definitely see them again. i had a really good time with them and it was an amazing opportunity to play with them. 'i’d love to have a drink with harry again!'

Prince William is focused and heads straight home to his family after a game, while Prince Harry is more laid-back and enjoys celebrating with a drink afterward. According to Alec White, a professional polo player who recently played with the princes at a competition in Ascot, both princes are \"down-to-earth, friendly guys\" who remember everyone's names and ask questions to get to know them better. Alec, who is from Australia and now spends around six months a year competing internationally, was impressed by the princes' sportsmanship and their love for the game. Despite their busy schedules, the princes expressed interest in Alec's Australian background and asked about his experiences living and playing polo in different countries. Alec hopes to continue competing professionally and eventually return to breed and train high-level polo horses on his family's property in Scone, Australia. He looks forward to seeing the princes again and having a drink with Prince Harry, who he describes as \"lots of fun\" and \"the party boy.\""}

'rats burrow and live in colonies,' health commissioner mary bassett told the city council at a hearing. 'i'll sometimes imagine when i walk through a park, if i could have sort of a 'rat vision,' there are all these tunnels under there that are occupied by rats. and from there the rats fan out.' financed with $611,000 in the current city budget, inspectors will work with neighborhood associations, community boards, elected officials and building owners to plug up holes and put poison in rodent tunnels. for years, inspectors responding to complaints on the city's 311 hotline have already been searching for rats and their telltale signs: burrows, droppings, claw marks and gnawed holes. besides traps and poison, the city also has used contraceptives to curb the rats. new york's rat information portal — or, appropriately, rip — is an interactive online map that tracks health department violations, with searches by borough, address, block number and zip code. spots marked red are deemed to be rat-infested; those in yellow have passed inspection. the south bronx around yankee stadium has the dubious distinction of being the city's most rat-infested neighborhood, according to figures from 2012, the most recent available. inspectors gave a failing grade for infestation to at least 13 percent of more than 3,000 locations inspected in that area. washington heights came in at 12 percent of inspected locations, west harlem at 10 percent and the lower east side and adjacent chinatown at nearly 9 percent. rats can carry and spread diseases, bite and trigger asthma attacks. in may, a fpur-year-old boy died after ingesting rat poison in a bronx homeless shelter. it's impossible to tally the exact number of rats in new york, says the rev. joel grassi, a baptist minister and professional exterminator. 'as long as there are human beings in new york city, there will be rats, because they live off human garbage — that's their no. 1 thing,' says grassi, adding that the best way to manage the rat population is to eliminate their food supply. just because your pet runs after backyard squirrels doesn't mean it could ever catch one. when at its best, the alley pack works together - one dog will sniff out a rat and signal its whereabouts, often by barking. another leaps at the hideaway to rout the quarry, and then a third lurches to catch it as it flees. a rat that scuttles into the open might get caught in a rundown, or even a tug of war, between dogs that circle and flank it. after making a kill with a bite or a shake, the hunters trot back, rat in mouth, and allow their owners to take it from their jaws. the night's kill ends up in a trash bin. the participants say they're less about killing rats than giving dogs the experience of chasing them. the health department declined to comment on the hunts. the idea has a long history. a noted 1851 examination of working-class life in london describes rat-catchers working the city's streets with ferrets and terriers. more recently, a rat-catching dachshund got attention in seattle when its owner happened by while city councilman tom rasmussen was checking out a downtown cleanup program in 2010. rasmussen snapped a picture of the dog, rat in mouth, and posted the photo on his website. there's even an american dog breed called a rat terrier, though its origins lie on farms. rat-tracking recently became an official canine sport, called 'barn hunt.' dogs get two minutes to sniff around a hay-bale maze and indicate where they smell a rat concealed in a crush-proof, aerated tube; the dog never catches the quarry. while dog owners may see it as time-honored pursuit, rat-hunting riles animal-rights advocates. people for the ethical treatment of animals, which opposes hunting in general, expressed outrage after video of a dog snatching rats in a new york city park surfaced online two years ago. peta spokesman martin mersereau calls the alley rat quests 'a twisted blood sport masquerading as rodent control.' reynolds counters that 'there are lots of worse things that people do to rats,' noting that poisons can sicken the animals for hours. as for the dogs, they have sometimes gotten stuck in waste bins or tumbled into holes, and a recent night left two with scrapes. but reynolds says none has ever been seriously hurt or fallen ill. in one recent foray, the dogs dispatched 13 rats within about a half-hour. the dogs prowled and prodded for about 90 more minutes before the group gave up for the night. # . but not to worry, said dachshund owner trudy kawami.

'before the world cup i showed him videos of marc overmars because he reminded me of him,' said rooney. 'he has the potential to be as good as overmars. bright future: raheem sterling was england's best player during wednesday's 1-0 win against norway . similar: wayne rooney believes sterling (left) shares some of the same qualities as marc overmars (right) captain material: rooney (left) has admitted showing sterling videos of overmars before the world cup . danger man: overmars scared opposition defenders with his pace and trickery in attacking areas . 63.6% - england’s win percentage against switzerland. they have won 14 of their 22 contests, drawing five and losing just three. they are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the swiss. 1 - good news for roy hodgson — england have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home. 192 - some bad news for hodgson. in 192 minutes of football, england have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot. 3 - wayne rooney looks a good bet to score at any time. the england captain has scored in each of his three appearances against switzerland. 2 - only two players have survived from england’s last game against the swiss — joe hart and jack wilshere both started that match at wembley in 2011. 17 - england like playing in basel. they have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game. that includes an 8-1 victory in 1963. 9 - switzerland have not lost at home for nine matches. their last defeat on home soil came against romania in may 2012. andrew magee . 'raheem is a fantastic and quite an unusual player. he can play right across the front line, out wide. although he's a small lad, he's really strong. the potential he's shown is incredible. he'll be a massive player for us over the next 10 to 15 years and, unfortunately, for liverpool.' overmars had terrifying speed and a clinical instinct. sterling arguably has a greater range of weaponry, but is still only 19 and developing. he is, nevertheless, the brightest spark in hodgson's post-world cup gloom. at the st jakob-park stadium here on monday night, england will look to him for creativity. four years ago, fabio capello's england arrived at the same stadium in similar circumstances. the world cup in south africa had gone badly and this was the first test for his team away from wembley. rooney was mired in front-page scandal at the time but he responded with the opening goal in a 3-1 win, which put capello in control on the road to euro 2012. hodgson could do with the same on his return to switzerland, where he is still feted for taking them to their first world cup finals in 28 years in 1994. 'winning this game does not make a great team in 2016,' said hodgson. 'neither does losing it make us a poor team in 2016. we are not in an embryonic stage — we are carrying on — but it is an early stage. we have to make sure after these next two years we are very, very strong.' wednesday's 1-0 home win over norway was not enough in itself to settle the anxieties that emerged in brazil. it is nearly two years since england actually beat any of the teams who qualified for the world cup. pivotal moment: wayne rooney scores from the penalty spot in england's 1-0 win against norway . challenges: roy hodgson will be without daniel sturridge and potentially jordan henderson on monday . preparation: hodgson leads his players in training at st jakob-park in basle on sunday afternoon . as ever, injuries have eaten into the squad. striker daniel sturridge's withdrawal on friday was more damaging than the loss of midfield rookie jack colback or back-up keeper ben foster but at least hodgson has danny welbeck ready to step in. if jordan henderson is not fit after twisting an ankle in training on sunday night it will bring another thorny problem — not least because england have brought only 17 outfield players — and challenge hodgson's theory that the nation is producing a breed of footballer no longer bound by positions. 'very few are classic number nines, or tens or sevens or fours or sixes,' hodgson said. 'they're not stereotyped. they're capable of different things. i've seen the under-20s play twice and when you watch them you do see a way in which english football is changing. i think back to the academy at blackburn 20 years ago and the type of players coming through now are different. 'it's difficult to look at an england team at any level and find a player who is not pacey, even a centre back. in the past we had stereotypical players who got by on the quality of their play. not now.' by the same token, he likes to think the style of his team is less predictable. 'the players we have are very different to the ones we had in 2012,' the manager added. 'we were a passing team. now we're a dribbling team. we're not a long-ball team any more. we try to pass through the midfield and create openings. we're athletic and pacey and technique is getting better.' hodgson refuted the accompanying theory that a 67-year-old coach might not be best-equipped to coach such modern footballers. stepping up: danny welbeck looks set to start for the three lions after an injury to daniel sturridge . settling : sterling (left) and his team-mates get used to the pitch on which they will face switzerland . all smiles: arsenal team-mates calum chambers (left) and jack wilshere (centre) share a joke in training . england will play on a monday for only the 10th time in 45 years when they face switzerland next week. uefa have spread out the qualification matches for euro 2016 as part of their new ‘week of football’ concept, with games taking place from thursday to tuesday. that means 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per cent in 2012 qualifying. the final set of fixtures in each group — scheduled for october 2015 — will still kick off simultaneously. england have only played nine monday games since 1966, but prior to that they were a regular occurrence. between 1880 and 1927, england played wales alone 33 times on a monday. the good news for england fans is their record is good... p...55  w...37  d...11  l...7 win %...67.3 . 'either you're a good coach or you're not,' he rapped back. 'either you know how to put your approach across or not. you just try to make sure the best players are in important places, and those around them complement them. that's how it's been since i started. i don't see any difference at all now to that.' and so, to the puzzle of where precisely to deploy sterling, who was so impressive at the tip of a diamond in the final 20 minutes against norway, after rooney had been replaced. does he keep him there or move him back to the wing, albeit with freedom to float? the team practised with the diamond midfield at times last week while at st george's park and, in the absence of sturridge, england can more easily revert to 4-2-3-1 without threatening rooney's place. 'there are options,' said hodgson. 'it's up to us to perform and play well. is it enough to come here and play 10 behind the ball and sneak a 0-0? no, i'd say it isn't.'

He believes that his team is less predictable and more athletic than in the past, with a greater emphasis on pace and technique. However, he acknowledges that he faces a difficult task in coaching a team of modern footballers, and that either he is a good coach or he is not.

who had been trafficked into the united states by her pimp, who brought her into a field where she was repeatedly raped on a trash bag by 30 men. the dna foundation stands for the fundamental right to freedom for every person -- because it's within our dna. \"it just seemed impossible to live in a world where that was going on and not, you know, do something about it,\" said moore. more: the cnn freedom project: ending modern-day slavery . according to kutcher, the average age of entry into the sex trade is 13. \"and that's globally, by the way,\" added the actor, who also pointed out that many americans view child sex slavery as a problem in places that they have no control over, such as cambodia, india or nepal. kutcher wants to people to realize trafficking is prevalent in the u.s., too. traffickers are often \"average joes,\" usually in their early 30s. \"and what they're really doing,\" said kutcher, \"is profiting off the sale of these women and girls.\" these men seem like perfect guys to vulnerable girls from broken homes. pimps start off nice and generous in a ritual that moore likens to \"courting.\" sometimes they meet the girls online, establish relationships with them, take them shopping, make them comfortable and gain their trust. one of the so-called faces of human trafficking joined \"piers morgan tonight\" under concealed identity from an undisclosed location to provide a first-hand account of what morgan called \"the horrors of sex trafficking.\" the 17-year-old girl went by the name \"nicole\" for the purposes of the interview. when nicole -- who is an american citizen -- was 13, her father went to jail while her mother battled drug addiction. nicole began establishing relationships with men online, leading to a cycle of pimps, drug problems and even jail. moore recalled the story of a girl who, now 18, was just 11 when she was taken in by a pimp. in a similar fashion, he took her to mcdonald's, took her to the mall and made her feel safe. pretty soon she was forced into child prostitution and given a $1,500-a-night quota. if she didn't meet her quota, she was beaten or forced to sit in a tub of ice. her pimp's nickname was \"daddy day care\" because the girls he overpowered were extremely young. according to the girl, moore said, the pimp would load the girls into an overcrowded car -- so crowded that some rode in the trunk -- drive to las vegas, place ads on craigslist and have the girls prostituting almost immediately. siddharth kara, author of \"sex trafficking, inside the business of modern slavery\" also joined the show. kara said at a minimum, there are \"1.5 million traffic sex slaves in the world today generating profits in 2010 that exceeded $39 billion.\" moore reiterated that she and kutcher initiated the campaign \"to create awareness. you have to acknowledge a problem exists before you can actually go about finding a solution,\" she said. \"and what we've found is that most people aren't even aware of what's going on.\" moore and kutcher maintain that they will remain committed to the cause no matter how long it takes to eradicate child sex slavery. morgan asked the couple famously addicted to twitter -- kutcher has 6.5 million followers, moore has 3.5 million -- if it is smart to use social media as a tool to spread the word about their campaign when social media often makes it easier for child sex traffickers to operate. \"for me,\" said kutcher, \"i think i looked at this platform and thought to myself, 'this could be the collective consciousness, right?' this platform, in and of itself, a little shout here, and a little shout there. but the key was being able to drive a link into deeper, richer content into a tweet, and then have that tweet be syndicated. \"i don't believe that there's a problem in the world that exists that the solutions didn't exist before the problem. so that's why we're using social media for this campaign,\" he said. \"it's to actually go right into the heart of where it's taking place. seventy-six percent of the transactions for child sex slavery is actually happening online. so if we can motivate people while they are online to do something about that, then we can make a dent.\" furthermore, kutcher urged people to visit sites such as craigslist and flag pages that appear to be about child trafficking. \"people can start to actually un-root this at its root,\" said kutcher, who urged people to go to facebook.com\/thednafoundation, put themselves in a video, share that video with friends and go to the action tab where the foundation outlines online initiatives. \"we want the social web to become the police for human trafficking online,\" kutcher told morgan. watch piers morgan live weeknights 9 p.m. et. for

They launched the Demi & Ashton Foundation to raise awareness and fight against child sex trafficking, which they say is often carried out by \"average joes\" who exploit vulnerable girls from broken homes. The couple met a 13-year-old girl who had been trafficked into the US and raped multiple times in a field. They also spoke with a 17-year-old girl who was taken in by a pimp at the age of 13 and forced into prostitution. Siddharth Kara, author of \"Sex Trafficking: Inside the Business of Modern Slavery,\" estimated that there are at least 1.5 million sex trafficking victims worldwide, generating profits of over $39 billion in 2010. Kutcher and Moore urged people to use social media to raise awareness and take action, including flagging suspicious pages on Craigslist and donating to their foundation. They also emphasized the importance of acknowledging the problem and taking collective action to eradicate it."}

it appeared to be holding, an israeli official said. \"we assumed it would take a while for the cease-fire to take hold,\" israel's ambassador to the united states, michael oren, told cnn. \"i understand now that it has taken hold. there hasn't been fire for a while and, of course, we are not firing, so there is a cease-fire.\" his remarks came after an israeli military spokeswoman, lt. col. avital leibovich, told cnn that five rockets had been fired from gaza in violation of the cease-fire. deputy foreign minister danny ayalon, in an interview with cnn, put the number of rockets at 12. wednesday's cease-fire followed eight days of violence along israel's border with gaza and nearly 150 deaths -- the vast majority of them palestinian. egypt's morsy praised for his key role in talks . the cease-fire, announced in a joint news conference in cairo with u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton and egyptian foreign minister mohamed kamel amr, took effect at 9 p.m. (2 p.m. et). gazans took to the streets, firing guns into the air in celebration of what they considered to be a victory over israel's military. the agreement calls for israel to halt all acts of aggression on gaza, including incursions and the targeting of people, according to egypt's state news agency egynews. it also calls for the palestinian factions to cease all hostilities from gaza against israel, including the firing of rockets and attacks on the border. border crossings were to be opened thursday night, and the movement of people and goods across them was to be eased, it said. on the ground: follow updates from cnn's reporters . the agreement came after a day of negotiations that included clinton, egyptian president mohamed morsy and palestinian officials. israeli government spokesman mark regev said the agreement calls for \"complete and total cessation of all hostile activity initiated in the gaza strip.\" \"for us, that's victory. that's what we wanted,\" he said. prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned of possible additional military action if the cease-fire fails to lead to long-term security. \"but at this time, the right thing for the state of israel is to exhaust this opportunity to obtain a long-term cease fire,\" he said. netanyahu thanked u.s. president barack obama for his \"unreserved support\" of israel's actions. it was the november 14 assassination by israeli forces of ahmed al-ja'abari, the head of hamas' military wing, that ignited the fighting. opinion: will real change come from this cease-fire? israel launched its offensive with a stated goal of ending the rocket attacks on southern israel from inside gaza by degrading the ability of palestinians to launch such attacks. \"their attempts backfired against them,\" said khaled meshaal, a hamas political leader. \"they wanted to destroy the infrastructure of the resistance of hamas. they claim they have done so, and they have not. they are bankrupt.\" he cited israel's destruction of buildings and killings that included civilians. \"this is their accomplishment,\" he said. \"they have nothing else to show. and our rockets continued to strike them until the last minute.\" israel will hold hamas responsible for any attacks from gaza, whether conducted by that organization or any others, regev said. he said the agreement reflects that understanding. ireport: share your stories from the region . as he was preparing to return to new york from tel aviv, u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon said late wednesday his biggest concern was for the safety of civilians, \"no matter where they are. innocent people, including children, have been killed or injured on both sides. families on both sides were forced to cower in fear as the violence raged around them.\" he said that more than 139 palestinians had been killed, more than 70 of them civilians, and more than 900 were injured. in addition, some 10,000 palestinians had lost their homes, he said, adding there was a critical need for humanitarian aid in the territory. idf's leibovich dismissed such concerns. \"there is no crisis in gaza,\" she told cnn, adding that she had seen pictures wednesday morning of markets filled with fresh produce. \"i understand that some things are not convenient,\" she said. during the conflict, rocket fire killed four israeli civilians and wounded 219 other people, most of them civilians, three of them seriously, ban said. in addition, an israeli soldier was killed and 16 were wounded, one critically, he said. smuggling weapons to gaza -- the long way . in all, 1,456 rockets were estimated to have been fired from gaza into israel, with three long-range missiles hitting the outskirts of jerusalem, a move he called \"unprecedented.\" israeli forces reported strikes on more than 1,450 targets in gaza, ban said. they targeted, but were not limited to, attacks on rocket-launching sites, military bases, police stations and tunnels along the border with egypt, he said. hundreds of other buildings were hit, ban said, adding that he condemned \"indiscriminate rocket fire from gaza into israel,\" but also believed that the \"excessive and disproportionate use of force that endangers civilian lives is intolerable.\" long-term solutions for gaza and the palestinians in general must be found, he said. \"once calm is fully restored and the violence ends, a broader cease-fire will have to address all the underlying causes of conflict, including the full opening of crossings, palestinian reconciliation and an end to weapons smuggling.\" how middle east has changed since last gaza conflict . regev said the deal calls for talks to begin thursday on easing economic restrictions on gaza. \"if the border is quiet, that enables us to be more forthcoming,\" he said. clinton, who shuttled among israel, the west bank and egypt to help negotiate the deal, said the united states will continue to work with regional partners to implement and expand the agreement. obama spoke wednesday morning with morsy, thanking the egyptian leader for his leadership in negotiating the proposal. as recently as wednesday afternoon, hamas officials had been calling for more strikes against israel, while that country's military continued to press its campaign against what it said were suspected rocket-launching sites and \"terrorist hideouts.\" arab-americans watch conflict with mix of worry, relief . the cease-fire talks, held in the west bank, israel and cairo, continued despite a lunchtime bus attack near the defense ministry headquarters in tel aviv. at least two bombs were planted on the bus, israeli police spokesman micky rosenfeld said. one of the bombs exploded, blowing out the windows of the bus, he said. rosenfeld said 24 people were wounded, three of them seriously. aviva shemer with ichilov hospital said pedestrians were among the injured. belief blog: how u.s. jews view the situation . police said they were seeking at least one and possibly two suspects. hamas put its own spin on the attack in a banner on al-aqsa, calling it \"a natural response to the massacre of the al-dalou family and targeting of innocent palestinian civilians.\" nine members of the al-dalou family died sunday in an israeli airstrike, provoking outrage among palestinians. \"we told you #idf that our blessed hands will reach your leaders and soldiers wherever they are,\" the al qassam brigades, the military wing of hamas, said on twitter. \"you opened the gates of hell on yourselves.\" diplomats said they were hoping to avoid a repeat of

yaya sanogo. well, 18 months, 19 appearances and 73 seconds, but when his first arsenal goal finally arrived, it was wonderfully timed. it was a strike to puncture the pressure and soothe the nerves. sanogo was engulfed by supporters and team-mates, while arsene wenger punched the air. a striker who had forgotten the way to goal had found the net at a most crucial moment, before the result was put beyond doubt by alexis sanchez, a striker who seemingly cannot miss. alexis sanchez runs towards the arsenal fans in celebration of his second-half strike against borussia dortmund . the chile international now has 13 goals and three assists in his last 20 games for arsene wenger's side . sanchez looks on as his curled strike puts arsenal into a commanding 2-0 lead on wednesday night .

rubbish the claim players need time to adjust in england. where would arsenal be without him? wenger may choose not to dwell on that. what was important for the manager was victory after three games without a win, which triggered familiar complaints about his strategy from some quarters. for the 15th consecutive year, he leads his team into the knockout stages of the champions league and wenger is fiercely proud of this record. there is even an outside chance of topping the group. there was a clean sheet and an encouraging performance from rookie keeper damian martinez but it was not all positive news. sanogo pulled a hamstring towards the end of the game and captain mikel arteta limped off with a calf injury which wenger admitted ‘looks quite serious’. injuries have compounded inconsistent form and the squad is stretched to its limits as it enters the busy festive schedule. at least wenger knows his decision to start with sanogo was justified. the 21-year-old was included ahead of lukas podolski on account of his ability to hold up the ball and bring others into the game, which he did instantly. the game had barely kicked off when calum chambers threw him the ball to fight for with his back to goal, near the edge of the dortmund penalty area. he held off the challenge of matthias ginter and flicked a pass to santi cazorla, who slipped the ball back to him. in front of goal, sanogo made no mistake. he looked offside but the flag stayed down. the emirates stadium sighed with relief and sang: ‘he scores when he wants!’ alex oxlade-chamberlain and sanchez zipped around on the flanks pulling yellow shirts out of line and allowed aaron ramsey to slide sanogo clear again. with a little more time to think, his actions were far less clinical and ginter had time to recover and make a block. jurgen klopp’s team, too fast and furious for arsenal in dortmund in the opening game of this campaign, were simply not the same. sanchez curls his 57th minute strike

they, too, have seen confidence eaten away by injuries and languish third from bottom in the bundesliga, a fact overlooked by those who have decided klopp should replace wenger. dortmund made a sluggish start. it was midway through the first half before they got any toe-hold in the game and began to test arsenal’s fragile defence. even then it was not a severe test and klopp cut an agitated figure on the touchline. for a spell either side of the interval, ilkay gundogan enjoyed good possession in midfield and dictated the tempo, often searching to hit lukasz piszczek on the overlap. ciro immobile was close to connecting with a cross before henrikh mkhitaryan collected a nod-down from piszczek and forced a splendid save from martinez. like sanogo, the keeper had stepped forward when it was required. martinez thwarted mkhitaryan again and made late saves, including a terrific one with his right boot from substitute adrian ramos. the arsenal players celebrates the french youngster's

adventure after the break but this only helped arsenal, offering more freedom to oxlade-chamberlain, cazorla and sanchez as they sprang on the counter-attack. roman weidenfeller made a fine save with his left hand to keep out a drive by sanchez which fizzed across the slick surface, but was stranded by a lob from the ox moments later. weidenfeller turned, expecting to see the ball drop into his goal, but it struck woodwork and bounced clear. oxlade- chamberlain held his head. the disappointment did not last. sanchez took a pass from cazorla in the inside-left area, ducked on to his right foot and curled a shot beyond the diving dortmund keeper into the far corner. klopp made changes in a bid to shake a reaction from his team, but they had qualified already and this can play subconsciously. arsenal have a glimmer of a chance to win the group, but they need to beat galatasaray and hope anderlecht win in dortmund. until then, wenger will bank the win and move on to west

country, other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state's footsteps or stand back. arizona's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the united states illegally. it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them. critics, including immigrant advocates and the american civil liberties union of arizona, are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status. the bill made it through the state senate on monday after it was passed by the state house last week. it's now awaiting the signature of republican gov. jan brewer. supporters of the measure expect her to sign it. latino members of congress are calling on brewer to veto it. michael hethmon, general counsel for the immigration reform law institute, helped draft the language of the arizona bill. the institute is the legal affiliate of the federation for american immigration reform. on the heels of the arizona initiative, hethmon said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. he declined to identify the states, citing attorney-client privilege. \"arizona was meant to be the leading edge,\" hethmon said. \"if you are going to work on developing a state-based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- arizona is the place to do it.\" hethmon pointed to arizona's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform, noting that \"what's happening in arizona just didn't pop out of nowhere. it's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process.\" republican state rep. russell pearce, who sponsored the legislation in arizona, said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent. state laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to numbers from the national conference of state legislatures. in 2005, 300 bills were introduced. the next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009. about 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education. about1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year. hethmon cited the election year, the democratic leadership's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation. \"historically, not only in the u.s. but in virtually all industrialized nations, when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players,\" he said. whether arizona becomes the standard-bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation, said ann morse, the program director of the national conference of state legislatures' immigrant policy project. \"certainly states will look at it, but not in a rush,\" she said. with court challenges promised from opponents, states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it's costly, morse said. omar jadwat, the staff attorney with the aclu's immigrants rights' project, said following in arizona's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction. \"although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path, i think it's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter, that arizona's approach is the wrong one,\" he said. isabel garcia, a legal defender in arizona's pima county, blasted the bill as \"the most dangerous precedent in this country, violating all of our due process rights.\" \"we have not seen this kind of legislation since the jim crow laws. and targeting our communities, it is the single most largest attack on our communities,\" she said. pearce brushed off her criticism, saying, \" 'illegal' is not a race, it's a crime.\" \"we do not tolerate those who break into our country, just like we don't tolerate those who break into our homes,\" he said. hethmon praised the legislation as \"the most cost-effective and the most humane way to deal with the illegal immigration problem.\" \"every time you convince an illegal alien to self-deport, you bypass having to resort to direct physical deportation,\" he said. in addition to providing a model for other states, hethmon said the legislation in arizona and other bills in the works in other states also provide an example on the national level. \"the states are laboratories for democracy. the federal government is in gridlock,\" he said. \"we're providing models for the day when the ice breaks up on the hill and the legislative waters flow and the country decides to confront this problem in a realistic way.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":".

across the english channel to raise money for veterans on the 65th anniversary of d-day. a group of american students rest and warm up in between turns swimming in the english channel. they didn't make it to the shores of france, but the physical and psychological anguish was enough to remind them of the soldiers their journey was meant to commemorate. \"i recognize that i have not done anything. even an attempt to swim the channel -- and a failed attempt at that -- is incomparable to the sacrifices people make on a day-to-day basis for our country,\" said daniel decker, a graduate of the u.s. naval academy who is studying at oxford university on a marshall scholarship from the navy. \"at the same time, i'm happy we were able to raise some money to go toward veterans and raise awareness of the sacrifices they're making,\" he said. \"that's the best blessing i get from this -- not necessarily success for the hardship of our ordeal but the awareness raised, some recognition put toward people who really deserve it.\" decker, 22, is one of five reluctant heroes who left dover, england, around 10 p.m. friday, and set out over the channel's choppy waters, accompanied by friends, the captain of the suva and a representative from the channel swimming association. collectively, they swam about 23 miles in speedos and swim caps, slathered in petroleum jelly, against strong currents in waters that neared 55 degrees fahrenheit. swells reaching 6-7 feet steered them off course and knocked them against the boat at times before forcing them to turn around about 1.5 miles from their destination. \"i would have much rather touched french soil but, at the end of the day, we swam the english channel,\" said eric gardiner, one of two people aboard the ship who managed to avoid vomiting. \"i felt like an ant in a toilet bowl. it was kind of humbling.\" yet the group, which consists of two rhodes scholars and three naval academy graduates who will enter seal training after school, considers the mission a success, in terms of honoring veterans of the past and present. they raised $5,000 for the mission continues, a missouri-based nonprofit that helps wounded and disabled veterans serving their communities after they return to the united states. \"we, as a group, wanted to do this to honor the inspirational veterans of the greatest generation of the past. most of us had grandpas that fought in world war ii and as a result, this historical anniversary had a special significance to all of us,\" said scott erwin, a rhodes scholar and former department of defense employee who was injured in iraq. \"we also wanted to do something to recognize today's inspirational veterans. we chose mission continues because all of us believe in its mission of attempting to allow veterans injured in combat operations to continue to serve causes great than themselves when they return to us,\" he said. the mission continues provides wounded and disabled veterans with paid fellowships while they pursue service and leadership roles in the community, said co-founder eric greitens, a navy seal officer who used his combat pay to help start the organization. \"there are a lot of programs for wounded and disabled veterans designed to give them many things they need, like free backpacking trips, rental cars, access to heath care facilities,\" he said. \"but no one was giving them a challenge or an opportunity to continue their service to the country even though their wounds had cut short their military service.\" erwin and greitens, also a former rhodes scholar, met after erwin returned from iraq. through erwin's experiences recovering at the walter reed army medical center, he became involved in the mission continues, helping to raise funds after he went to oxford. erwin initiated the idea of the channel swim as a fundraiser about six months ago and recruited decker, gardiner, shipley and u.s. naval academy graduate joseph hess to the cause. they trained in coastal beaches throughout the winter, but nothing could have prepared them for the experience of a midnight swim in the english channel. \"i went in at 1 a.m. and it was completely black. you can't see anything other than the headlight of the boat and everywhere you look is complete blackness,\" said drew shipley, 25, another rhodes scholar who is working on his ph.d. in political sociology. \"we trained well but there's no way to train for those water temperatures, plus the sensory overload of being in the middle of the english channel in the middle of the night surrounded by darkness.\" the five swimmers took hourlong turns in the water, using the intervals on the ship to return to normal body temperature before they prepared to return the open sea. after his third time out, one of the swimmers returned with the look of a \"wild animal\" in his eye, according to his teammates, and fell into violent shakes. \"we got every layer of clothing we could on him, and we had to give him bear hugs to give him some body heat,\" said gardiner, another graduate of the naval academy, who is studying at queens university in belfast, ireland, on a navy marshall scholarship. \"he really left it all out there in the water. it was inspiring because he took it to that level.\" gardiner, 22, said it has been a dream of his to swim the channel ever since he visited the beaches of normandy in high school -- the same trip that inspired him to join the armed forces. \"it wasn't necessarily about glory, it was about d-day and charity and doing it as a team,\" he said. \"compared to what those who invaded on d-day had to encounter when they made it to the other side, this was chump change.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":", Five American

You get straight to the point.\n<<\/SYS>>\n\ncreate a summary of the news article: (cnn) -- remember the name: jordan spieth is only 20 years of age, but the golfer is already being mentioned in the same breath as tiger woods after a whirlwind start to his pga tour career. spieth, like woods, was a multiple u.s. junior amateur champion before dominating college golf in his freshman year. quickly turning professional, he became the first teenage winner on the pga tour in 82 years, and at this week's traditional curtain raiser to 2014 he finished second to veteran zach johnson at the tournament of champions in hawaii. johnson, the 2007 masters champion, carded four birdies in seven holes to pip joint third-round leader spieth by a shot on monday. the 37-year-old tweeted after his win: \"i love underdog stories\" -- a recognition of the youngster's growing reputation. spieth is one of cnn living golf's \"five players to watch\" in 2014, as he seeks to add to last year's maiden victory. along with three of the biggest names in the sport -- who enjoyed wildly varying fortunes last season --we have also cast our net in the direction of asia, where the emerging prodigies seem to get ever younger and ever more a threat to the established order on the pga tour. jordan spieth . starting 2013 ranked 810th in the world and having turned professional halfway through his sophomore year at the university of texas, spieth ended it as the pga tour's rookie of the year and with a place on the winning u.s. presidents cup team. so highly-rated was spieth, that his first victory on the pga tour at the john deere classic in july was hardly considered a surprise. he won a three-way playoff against defending champion johnson and david hearn after spectacularly holing from a greenside bunker on the final hole of regulation play to force the shootout. spieth then lost in a playoff for the wyndham championship to another promising young golfer, 23-year-old patrick reed and charged to fourth in the deutsche bank championship with a last-round 62. he ended the year just outside the world's top 20, earning the nod from fred couples as a captain's pick in the presidents cup. woods was a teammate in the comfortable victory over the internationals, and when asked about spieth the world no. 1 gave the following verdict: \"he's earned his way on here and he's played exceptional golf and his talent is going to take him a long way over the years.\" tiger woods . woods may have ended 2013 as the pga tour's golfer of the year, but will want to finally lose the tag of \"14-time major winner\" and close on jack nicklaus's all-time record of 18. woods has been stuck on 14 since winning the u.s. open in june 2008 with an injured knee which required surgery and a lengthy recuperation. his well-chronicled personal problems also clearly impacted on his career and it was only last year which saw the re-emergence of a golfer resembling the former all-conquering tiger. five wins on the pga tour were ample evidence, but in the majors his best was tied fourth at the masters and he will be focused on changing that stat. with youngsters like spieth emerging and veterans like arch-rival phil mickelson showing no signs of fading away, woods, who has just turned 38, knows this is a big year -- and the choice of venues for the majors could be in his favor. \"i'm really excited about the major championships next year. i've won at three of the four venues -- augusta national, valhalla golf club and royal liverpool -- and on pinehurst no. 2 (u.s. open), i'm trending the right way, having finished third and second,\" he told his own website. woods skipped the opening tournament of the year in hawaii to spend time with his girlfriend lindsey vonn -- who will miss the 2014 winter olympics in sochi due to her own knee problem -- before beginning his own buildup to the masters in april. he still holds the record low total at augusta of 270 back in 1997 when he announced himself to the wider sporting public with a stunning victory. rory mcilroy . mcilroy started 2013 as the world's top-ranked golfer and ended it as the sixth best after a series of on and off-course problems. with a new management team and a new fiancee -- he announced his engagement to danish tennis star caroline wozniacki on new year's eve on twitter -- the popular 24-year-old from northern ireland can enter 2014 with optimism. buoyed by an end-of-year victory at the australian open, mcilroy has renewed confidence in himself and his nike equipment after a big-money switch to the sportswear manufacturer at the start of 2012 that some linked to his poor form on the course. \"i'm confident with my game and confident where it's going,\" mcilroy told reporters. \"i won a major in 2011 and 2012 but not in 2013, so i'll try to make up for that with two this year.\" a bold prediction, but mcilroy clearly has the talent to back up his words and has been practicing hard in dubai ahead of his opening tournament of the season at the abu dhabi championship starting on january 16. he will lock horns with woods for the first time in 2014 at the dubai desert classic a fortnight later -- an early marker for the rest of the year. adam scott . scott was denied the \"triple crown\" back in his home country in december by mcilroy, who mounted a final round charge to win at royal sydney. following wins at the australian pga and masters events, it would have capped a triumphant 2013 for the 33-year-old from adelaide, who won his first major at augusta. scott also paired with jason day to win the world cup for australia and, combined with an impressive victory at the barclays, the first event of the pga tour's fedex cup playoffs, it left him second in the world rankings behind woods at year's end. many believe scott will reach top spot in 2014 and add to his majors haul, having shrugged off the disappointment of letting a four-shot lead slip to hand ernie els the 2012 british open crown. a dramatic playoff win over angel cabrera of argentina at augusta sealed his place in golfing history and he was also in contention at the british open and u.s. pga championships. scott performed strongly at kapalua in the tournament of champions, tying for sixth, to serve notice he will again be a force in 2014. lee chang-woo . both the pga tour, and in particular the women's lpga tour, are becoming accustomed to precocious teenagers from asia turning up in the united states and making their mark. last year it was china's 14-year-old guan tianglang who had greats like gary player singing his praises with his performances at augusta -- where he made the cut -- and subsequent pga tour events. in 2014, south korean lee chang-woo has the same opportunity after emulating guan and winning the asia-pacific amateur championship. that booked a place for the 19-year-year-old at the masters and also a spot at final qualifying for the british open. he is likely to grab the opportunities with both hands, having already mixed it with established professionals while still in the unpaid ranks. seoul-born lee tied for second with mcilroy at the korea open, the week before his asia-pacific win, and claimed victory in an earlier korean tour event. \"playing in the masters has been my dream since i started playing golf,\" he said. \"this is a great honor, i have never been so excited.\" guan could not repeat his heroics of 2012 and finished back in eighth, but lee was initially challenged in the final round by another young chinese star, dou zecheng, before the 16-year-old fell away on the back nine. the pedigree of the asia-pacific amateur winners is also strong. since 2009, all but one winner has made the cut at the masters. japan's hideki matsuyama, a previous qualifier by this route, achieved the feat twice and finished third in the frys.com open last october, the opening event on the 2013-14 pga tour calendar. lee will be hoping to make a similar impression to earn sponsor invites for pga events after the masters, while matsuyama has already proved he can mix it with the best while still in the amateur ranks.

The paper is named 'Multi-arm Robotic Swimming with Octopus-Inspired Compliant Web'. According to the research team's tests, the robot octopus swims at just over 3.9 inches (100mm) per second when fitted with silicon arms only, but adding webs increases the speed to 7 inches (180mm) - or half its body length per second. A video of the robot also shows it carrying a ball in its arms."}

'there are no food stylists, and instead of a live audience of about 100 people, as there was for the launch of food tube, it's usually just me on my own.' mr lewis now wants to inspire other 'kitchen virgins' to try out new recipes. 'i want to inspire other people to cook instead of feeling intimidated about giving it a try,' he said. 'my philosophy is that if i can do it, then anyone can. 'everything you see me cook i am cooking for the first time - it is all about trying to inspire people who have never cooked to give it a go. 'i have done more than 700 videos to date, mainly recipes ranging from simple one-pot dishes, quick dinner ideas to cooking with kids or naughty desserts. 'i like to have fun, too, and often taste things people have been sending me or try and overcome food fears. basically, anything goes.' 'what is nice is the way my virgin kitchen has become a real community. i really enjoy the reaction i get from people who follow me. 'my phone doesn't stop vibrating these days, as i'm always getting messages on facebook, twitter and instagram.' mr lewis is a big fan of the frozen food he is seen preparing in his sainsbury's tv ads, which aired on screen last friday. 'the freezer is great for storing meals ahead of time,' he said. 'if you can get into the habit of batch cooking at the weekend and storing in the freezer for a quick week night fix, you'll save having to cook from scratch and still get a great meal.' the 'love your freezer' campaign will run on tv and online until mid-february.

'there is the spirit of the law, why are they making a personal profit from allowances which they receive from the taxpayer? in this case they very clearly are.' mr jackson said: 'all british citizens are entitled . to seek legal adjudication if the state’s actions are unfair or possibly . illegal and so i will be forcefully resisting their precipitous . litigation.' martin bell, a former mp, said mps should repay any profit they made on their properties . he disputes ipsa's assessment that the family home in his constituency rose in value by 20 per cent from 2010 to 2012, claiming house prices in the area actually fell by three per cent. 'at . my own expense, i have paid for an accurate recent expert valuation and . i have made a reasonable offer to ipsa to settle the matter and reduce . the legal costs which will have to be met by the taxpayer.

driving or flying can now be cheaper than catching the train - even for solo journeys . that is more than eight times the cost of an open return national express coach journey at £39.50 and enough to pay for a family of four flying on ryanair to barcelona (£184) or athens (£240). it would also pay for a flight to rome on norwegian air (£240), or a single traveller flying to new york for £334 with kuwait airways. the fare findings follow a damning report this week by rail watchdogs showing that rail travellers have registered the lowest level of satisfaction with the railways in five years. they were annoyed by overcrowded, expensive and late-running services. in january fares rose across all types of tickets by an average of 2.2 per cent. but season tickets went up by 2.5 per cent – not only well above the consumer prices index (cpi) inflation figure but also in excess of most annual pay rises. customer dissatisfaction has been compounded by anger over ‘fat cat bonuses’ awarded to rail chiefs, which have been branded ‘rewards for failure’. expensive: the comparison was carried out 20 years after the privatisation of the railways in britain . return tickets pre-booked . £41   barcelona . £53   athens . £62   rome . £94   marrakech . £95   dubrovnik . £150  st petersburg . £282  dubai . £334  new york . source: skyscanner . barry doe, an independent fares expert, was commissioned to carry out research on rising ticket prices by the transport salaried staffs association (tssa) union. his research shows that an open return rail ticket between london and bristol has soared by 246 per cent – from £57 to £197. the anytime fare from the capital to liverpool has jumped by 232 per cent from £93 to £309, while to cardiff it has increased by 211 per cent from £70 to £218. this makes cars a cost-effective alternative to rail travel – especially for families. aa president edmund king said: ‘for the cost of my annual rail season ticket – a painful £4,028 – i could buy a second-hand car for £1000, tax and insure it and still have enough to pay for 20,000 miles of petrol, which is two years’ motoring for the average driver.’ a spokesman for virgin trains defended the £329 return anytime fare from london to manchester, noting that a fraction of travellers paid it and most chose from a range of cheaper flexible options. they added: ‘over the last year the number of passengers travelling on the standard anytime fare of £164.50 one way and £329 return represented only 3.7 per cent of the journeys made between london and manchester. an open return to edinburgh even with nationalised east coast costs £313 - up from £130 two decades ago . many of our advanced fares from manchester remained the same or came down in january – overall our fares increased by 1.4 per cent which is significantly below the industry average.’ a spokesman for the rail delivery group, which represents network rail and train operators, said: ‘the tssa’s figures are misleading in the extreme as they deliberately focus only on the most expensive fares. on average, the cost of rail travel has increased by 6 per cent in real terms over the last 15 years. ‘this helps explain why passenger numbers have almost doubled over the period, contributing to a fivefold increase in money going back to reinvest in a better railway.’ but labour’s transport spokesman michael dugher said: ‘rail passengers are being let down and ripped off. things have got worse on our railways.’ and tssa general secretary manuel cortes said: ‘passengers have paid a terrible price for this political folly. the private rail industry has taken all the gain while passengers have suffered all the pain. passengers have paid a small fortune on fares while rail bosses are paid a fortune. ‘we want to end this persecution of passengers which started after privatisation.’ he added: ‘it is hardly surprising that satisfaction is falling when commuters are paying record fares for a worsening service. it is an absolute disgrace.’ [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":".] Rail fares in the UK have increased significantly over the past 20 years, with some open return tickets costing more than the price of a family flight to the Mediterranean or a solo flight to New York.

The study found that an open return ticket from London to Manchester with Virgin Trains has increased from £96 to £329, a rise of 243%.

The study's findings have been met with criticism from rail passengers, who are experiencing decreased satisfaction with the rail service.

candidate came out with a new promise. jobs! schools! better social services! a better future! he smiled broadly as the cheering swelled, wiping the sweat off his brow with a white handkerchief. he wore a freshly pressed white shirt with an open collar, under a well-cut blue blazer. he was the picture of authority and self-confidence. afterward, one of the farmers brushed off the other contenders in the presidential election as posers. \"there is no one else,\" he told me. \"the other candidates don't care about egypt. they've been hired!\" his candidate, hosni mubarak, easily won the election, back in september 2005, though there is little doubt it was rigged in his favor. it was another \"historic\" election, the first multi-candidate presidential election ever, though the challengers never had a chance against an incumbent backed by the vast resources and lack of scruples of the egyptian state. today, mubarak is under armed guard albeit in a luxury wing of a cairo hospital, awaiting the verdict from his trial in early june. much has changed since the last presidential election, but much remains the same. mubarak came from the military, and the military, in the form of the supreme council of the armed forces (scaf), still runs the country. while scaf has tried to talk the talk of the new era, all of its members rose through the ranks of the egyptian military with the blessings of hosni mubarak. according to the u.s. state department cables posted on the internet by wikileaks, midlevel egyptian army officers referred to field marshall mohamed hussein tantawi, the head of scaf, as \"mubarak's poodle.\" scaf has overseen the process that led to this presidential election, in which egyptians had the opportunity to choose their president from among 13 candidates on the ballot (although two pulled out of the race). since mubarak stepped down on february 11, 2011, scaf has stumbled from one crisis to another, reacting with violence and brutality against protesters, but often ceding ground when tahrir square filled and passions boiled. scaf has pledged to hand over executive power to a civilian president by the end of june. in theory, egypt is on the cusp of monumental change. these are heady days in egypt. everyone seems to be pontificating on politics, comparing candidates, pondering platforms. the election is everywhere. the airwaves are full of it, facebook and twitter are abuzz with it, the streets are festooned with posters and banners. on the surface it seems so different from the predictable, managed, officially sanctioned politics of the mubarak years. but the choice facing egyptians is, actually, little changed. under the old regime, hosni mubarak made it clear he was the champion of the status quo, holding back the islamist tide, led by the then-banned but tolerated muslim brotherhood. in this election, voters can choose the status quo -- with some lip service to post-revolutionary reality -- in the form of former foreign minister and later arab league secretary general amre moussa or ex-civil aviation minister and briefly prime minister ahmed shafik. or they can opt for a new islamic order, either with the full-on muslim brotherhood candidate, u.s.-educated mohamed morsi, or the islamic-lite candidate abdelmonen abol fotoh. add to the mix hamdeen sabahy, a nasserist who appeals to the leftists and the nationalists. in recent days sabahy's numbers have been rising, perhaps as a backlash against the paucity of choices among the front-runners. the establishment -- the bureaucracy, the military, the intelligence services and the business community -- clearly doesn't want to see the islamists come to power. tuesday, the semi-official cairo daily, al-akhbar, ran an ominous page-three story with the headline: \"beware of a military coup: the future will be frightening if the brotherhood reaches the summit of power.\" the source of this disturbing headline was none other than former vice president and veteran intelligence chief omar suleiman, quoted in the london pan-arab daily al-hayat. he painted a grim picture of the brotherhood setting up a revolutionary guard, along the lines of iran, to fight against the egyptian military. the military, he warned, does not know how cunning the brotherhood can be. another cairo daily ran banner headlines warning that if either of the islamist candidates wins it would be \"apocalypse now\" -- a mosaic plague of catastrophic proportions will descend upon egypt, with a breakdown in security, violence, kidnapping, thuggery and theft, massive capital flight, political isolation, unemployment, poverty, and illness. on top of all that, once the islamists have power, the paper predicted, they will murder all their political opponents. those who are opposed to the brotherhood tend to see them as forked-tongue taliban in ties, eager to impose islamic law, force women to cover up, and ban alcohol. but for egyptians struggling with rising prices and low wages, the brotherhood offers the promise of a better future. indeed, the view is not so grim among those who have received only the crumbs off the status quo's table. gamal, a bank clerk living in the old cairo district of sayida zaynab, will be voting for mohamed morsi of the brotherhood. \"the health system is in bad shape, as is education,\" he says. \"conditions for people in egypt are very, very bad.\" in the nile city of beni suef, farmer ashour darwish attended a crowded muslim brotherhood rally, eager to hear morsi speak. he supports the brotherhood, he told me, because they are champions of what matters to him: \"justice, transparency, implementation of islamic law, the plight of the poor farmers, and unemployment.\" the brotherhood's political wing, the freedom and justice party, won more than 40% of the seats in egypt's lower house of parliament in recent elections. after being hounded by the police and intelligence agencies for decades, they are finally free to operate, and aren't shy about flexing their muscles. jihad haddad, a young brotherhood member, sees no reason why the group should be shy about its power. \"we came by the vote of the people and by the choice of the people,\" he says. \"what we really want is application of real reform policies on the ground, and we can't have that opportunity if we are out of executive power.\" it would be rash at this point to make any predictions of who will actually win that executive power. the muslim brotherhood is a formidable organization that can mobilize its supporters and ensure a high turnout. they did it for the parliamentary elections and they'll doubtless be able to do it this time as well. but the prospect of both the legislative and executive branches dominated by the brotherhood worries many. magdi zaki works in the finance ministry, and voted for the brotherhood. but he feels they are novices in power, grandstanding on live broadcasts from the parliament, but doing little else. \"they have no political background,\" he says dismissive contempt, like a seasoned theatre critic dismissing a flop. polls of potential voters have been all over the place, but they do show that a majority of egyptians have yet to make up their minds. they debate the choices in taxis and buses, in the subway, in cafes, over breakfast, lunch and dinner, over twitter and on facebook, changing their minds between meals. one seasoned veteran of egyptian politicsâ€”who requested anonymityâ€”chuckled over the fickle nature of the voters, and puts it this way: \"this is the first time i've ever had people ask me, 'who do you think is going to win the presidential election?' i honestly have no idea.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":"Љ The article discusses the upcoming presidential election in Egypt, which is scheduled to take place in early June. The election is seen as a crucial moment in Egypt's transition to a new era of democracy, as it will mark the first time that the country has elected a president through a multi-candidate election. However, the article suggests that the election may not bring significant change, as the candidates are largely seen as representatives of the old regime, with little difference between them. The article highlights the dominance of the military and intelligence services in Egyptian politics, and how they have shaped the election process. It also notes that the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been banned for decades, is now a major player in the election, with several of its candidates running for office. The article concludes that while the election may bring some change, it is unlikely to mark a significant departure from the status quo."}

(babycastles launched as a party alongside the blip festival, a showcase of chiptune musicians; this year's festival begins this week in new york.) meanwhile, the patrons of both of these independent communities are in one way or another striving to experience something new -- something that can't be bought in a store, but that is available for anyone to see and hear if they look in the right places. just like indie music, the independent gaming scene is trading in neat, mass-produced convenience for a rough-hewn, playful provocation. \"[at big gaming studios] games have become massive undertakings in which each developer acts like a cog. the budget for games has increased by billions of dollars, and developers don't take as much risk anymore,\" says salahuddin. \"so you see a lot of rehashed games from the same video game engine, like another \"unreal\" clone.\" the independent gaming movement \"is in response to that.\" the implications of babycastles remixing go wider than the music, art and gaming worlds. the hope, says salahuddin, is to build a kind of economy for independent gaming developers outside the large studios, something akin to what supports indie musicians who make much of their money through touring and merchandise. babycastles' other mission is to bring an obscured world of hobbyist game development to a larger audience -- a public that may be jaded with a culture often built on testosterone-fueled first-person shooters, or that tends to roll its eyes at the premise of games altogether. it's a formidable challenge, but, as the gallery's raucous and diverse gatherings prove, one that isn't so hard to beat. still, mixing games with the underground music scene can have its downside too -- some musicians who come to play fall in love with the games in the basement, salahuddin says. \"so bands started missing their sets.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":".

According to research, the number of reported cases of forced marriage in England is between 5,000 and 8,000 a year."}

'i've thought about killing myself many times,' won said in a recent interview at her small apartment in gunpo, just south of seoul. she has two big strikes against her. there are allegations that she was merely a low-level informant whose deeds were inflated by south korean officials eager to make pyongyang look bad, and by reporters digging for a sexy story. additionally, the sexual nature of her crimes carries a stigma in this conservative country. the sexual nature of won jeong-hwa's crimes carries a stigma in conservative south korea . won was imprisoned in 2008 after a court ruled that she posed as an ordinary north korean defector, then used sex to extract secrets from south korean military officers. the media began calling her 'north korea's mata hari' in reference to an exotic dancer from the netherlands who used sex to obtain military secrets during world war i. north korea accused south korea of cooking up a spy scandal to tarnish pyongyang's image and said won was a criminal. after won was released, she was a popular guest on tv talk shows where she spoke about her harsh, elite spy training. she said she disobeyed pyongyang's orders to assassinate two south korean army intelligence officers with poison. she also talked about how she fell in love with a junior army officer - the \"man of my life.\" he was later imprisoned for passing her secrets including a list of north korean defectors even after learning she was a spy. the attention caused south korean media to revisit her case. some reporters questioned the value of her espionage work, and raised suspicions based on testimony by north korean defectors who said they knew won and her family members in the north. won's 2008 court verdict said she was trained at a special operations unit in pyongyang and was a daughter of an agent killed on a spy mission in south korea in 1974. but won's stepfather, kim dong-soon, who came to south korea in 2007, said in an interview that won's biological father was an ordinary laborer who died of a heart attack, and that won was a high school dropout who had nothing to do with special operations forces. won denies kim's allegations. in the verdict and in interviews, it was said that north korea first sent won to south korea in 2001 to take photos of the exteriors of u.s. military installations and to collect south korean newspaper editorials about north korea. people dubious of won's elite status consider that low-level spy work. some defectors who met won before her 2008 arrest say she was often incoherent and unprofessional and could not have been a highly trained spy. 'i believe that she was exploited as an informant. ... she wasn't even worth being called a spy,' said kim yong-hwa, a defector-turned-activist. he said he once rejected won's request to meet with a high-profile north korean defector because she rambled too much. a key debunker of won's espionage record is won herself. she has said in media interviews that she was pressured by prosecutors to provide false testimony, particularly about her use of sex in spy work. 98128 . 67710 . 92346 . 56262 . 78275 . 87600 . 19854 . 128360 . 130080 . 62439 . 152741 . 80640 . 73840 . 79599 . 140928 . 80481 . 81549 . 125992 . life: won jeong-hwa said she once disobeyed pyongyang's orders to assassinate two south korean army intelligence officers with poison. she also said she fell in love with a junior officer in the south korean army . the trial verdict and an investigation by prosecutors said she slept with numerous men, including south korean officers and her boss at an agency where she worked. won said she used sex as a spying tool only once, to steal personnel management-related documents from an army major's home computer. she said she couldn't resist pressure by prosecutors who gave her alcohol and urged her to confess during questioning. they \"manufactured (the story of) my relations with men,\" she said. 'i'm not a mata hari.' prosecutors have dismissed won's claims. south korea has a history of forgiving former spies and assassins, though they are still sometimes ostracized. their careers in the media often depend on whether they were involved in high-profile cases that captured global attention, and whether they followed seoul's propaganda line against the north. won said a prosecutor told her during her questioning that she could make a new start in the south by following in the footsteps of kim hyon-hui, a north korean agent sentenced to death for bombing a south korean jet in 1987, killing all 115 passengers aboard. kim was later pardoned and wrote a best-selling autobiography. she often appears on tv to speak critically of north korea. several other north koreans who once attacked the south now embrace it. previous life: while working undercover for north korea's late dictator kim jong-il, won jeong-hwa would steal sex secret about his rivals in the south . one of the 31 north korean commandos who launched a brazen mission to assassinate south korea's president in 1968 is now a christian pastor who lectures about the north. a north korean crew member of a submarine that ran aground in the south, and who was captured alive after a massive manhunt that left 25 other comrades dead or missing, is a lecturer for the south korean navy. a spy arrested after a deadly shootout in 1995 works for a think tank run by the south's spy agency and wrote a book about his mission. won, on the other hand, feels trapped. no south korean tv station wants her as an expert because of reports that she may not have been an elite spy. finding work unrelated to her past is also impossible, she said, because no one wants to hire an unskilled woman with a criminal espionage record. one of the jobs she gained and quickly lost was at a noodle restaurant. she said a former colleague later told her the boss had been worried she would poison the food. the army officer won fell in love with has been released, but they are no longer in touch. nor is the father of her 12-year-old daughter in the picture: she said he is a south korean businessman she met in china, where she had been assigned to find and repatriate north korean defectors before she was sent to south korea. won said the government assistance she gets was not enough for her to even buy a school uniform for her daughter. a center that helps female ex-inmates gave one to her. many defectors shun her. she said her neighbors once asked that she move, and that her daughter's friends have been told by their parents to stay away from the girl.

'the gas has a toxic effect that pushes a person into a dream like state, and the person then falls asleep.' professor rikhavanov and tomsk polytechnic university have carried out thousands of experiments on the area for over four years. they failed to find radon because conventional methods of measuring radiation do not detect it in the air. he added: 'we eliminated viral and bacterial infections but also obtained test results that ruled out the possibility of radiation sickness too.

'when he turns his head his eyes stay fixed at what he was looking at. if you try to wake him it seems the wants to open his eyes but can't. sleepy valley, sleepy hollow, that's what people call us.' lyubov belkova, 60, claims to be the first resident to have fallen asleep in april 2010 and has since suffered seven separate episodes. she was diagnosed with ischemic strokes but then her neighbour began displaying the same symptoms. some have even reported suffering from vivid hallucinations. in september 2014, a russia today film crew reported radiation doses 16 times higher than would be expected from background radiation near the entrance of the abandoned mine. some locals claimed wind and smoke coming from the mines may be responsible for the illness. others claimed toxic waste has been buried in the area.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged Americans to donate to relief efforts, and Pakistani Prime Minister Yousef Raza Gilani appealed to residents to reduce spending on Ramadan feasts and upcoming independence day celebrations to help their fellow citizens affected by the flooding."}

cherry trees can hibernate in winter . at one end are the beehives, home to the all-important pollinators. on every tree, perfectly firm and shiny cherries in varying shades of crimson are decadently large. each bunch, the size of a man’s hand, must weigh a pound. and between the glossy dark leaves, there are at least one hundred bunches on every tree. the pickers, wearing traditional leather-belted wicker baskets around their hips, bury themselves among the leaves to get to the fruit. ‘we only pick fruit that has reached . the right shade — the colour tells you how ripe the fruit is,’ says . sarah. ‘cherries continue to ripen after picking, but only a little, so . it’s important to pick them when they are perfect.’ seven years ago, the neaves’ farm had 30 acres of old cherry trees, but they mainly grew apples and pears. cherry farming had dramatically declined. where there had been 5,000 hectares of cherry orchards in kent at the beginning of the 20th  century, by the end there were just 600. ‘the fruit was small and the quality low. the supermarkets were buying cheap fruit from france,’ says sarah. after we joined the common market, british fruit growers, who did not get an agricultural subsidy, found they could not compete with cheaper imports. thousands of acres of cherry orchards were destroyed. a cherry picker at work. sarah neaves, also a cherry farmer, from

practices of french, german and belgian growers in order to . compete. ‘in kent’s orchards, we grew huge trees, so long wooden ladders were needed for picking,’ he says. ‘it was picturesque, but it was just not practical. with today’s health and safety considerations, pruning and picking would be impossible.’ the trees in the neaves’ new orchards are small. just before they blossom, they are enclosed by metal frames covered with rain-proof plastic and netting at the sides to protect the fruit from its great enemy — birds. helen green, pictured, led the cherry aid campaign which energised farmers to look at cherry farming again . the gisela dwarf rootstock that the neaves planted in 2006 is german: the bushy, high-yielding trees can be easily picked and covered for protection in the

small, firm, bright red cherries weighed . out by the pound. they were a real treat. when i was a little girl, my . friends and i would hang pairs of cherries from our ears as pretend . earrings. it was the seventies and our mothers would never have allowed . us to get our ears pierced, so the seasonal summer cherry served as a . delightful — and edible — substitute. the fruit we loved then are now . heritage varieties, which originated from the wild mazzard or gean tree, . which grew up to 75 ft high (you can only imagine the health and safety . issues involved in picking them). varieties . derived from these ancient trees include the romantically named merton . heart, roundel heart, florence and waterloo. today, few of these are in . commercial production, but some survive in old

favourite. big, deep ruby red and full of sweet juice, it tastes amazing. my only criticism is that it is too large to fit in my old-fashioned cherry stoning gadget. so these magnificent fruit have to be pitted by hand before i can make jam and puddings. all this abundance shows british cherries have fought back to become a prominent crop. ‘as the trees mature they will yield more and more,’ says

deal was announced this week, but house gop opposition to immigration legislation remains the biggest roadblock to a bill getting to the president's desk, and that opposition only appears to be hardening. senate immigration deal includes tougher border security . the messy demise of the farm bill on the house floor on thursday demonstrated the divisions within gop ranks and the willingness of dozens of rank-and-file members to ignore their leadership.  while there's not a clear parallel between that bill's failure and the road ahead for immigration reform, the episode does underline the exceedingly tough task house speaker john boehner, r-ohio, faces as he attempts to guide immigration legislation through the house. boehner insists he wants to tackle immigration reform, but hasn't been clear about how he intends to navigate the controversial issue through his own conference. cnn poll: big generational divide in immigration battle . \"after all this talk about the senate there has been so little focus on the house and that it has been, pre-farm vote -- and will continue to be post-farm vote -- the choke point for any immigration reform, \" amy walter, national editor of the cook political report told cnn. house gop leaders knew many conservatives would vote against the farm bill because they viewed the food-stamp programs as too expensive.  but 62 members, roughly a quarter of all house republicans, broke with boehner, who made a rare endorsement of the bill, and joined with the vast majority of house democrats to take down the bill.  even if democrats produced the level of support republicans say they anticipated, gop leaders still didn't have support within their own ranks to get the farm bill through. the farm bill's defeat \"exposed the vulnerabilities of so called compromise legislation in the house,\" walter added. but even before the farm bill fiasco boehner began pouring cold water on the immigration momentum coming out of the senate.  as news was breaking on the senate deal on thursday morning boehner compared immigration reform to obamacare, the bill republicans constantly malign as the prime example of government overreach. \"every day as obamacare is being implemented, americans are reminded of what happens when you have big legislation rammed through congress with minimum support,\" boehner said at his weekly news conference.  \"americans' confidence in their government is near an all-time low, so if immigration reform is going to work it's essential that we have the confidence of the american people and that it's done the right way,\" the speaker added. the deliberate move to put immigration in the same category as obamacare showed boehner is in no mood to muscle through a massive immigration overhaul unless it can garner significant votes from both sides of the aisle -- a tall order in the house. boehner didn't comment directly on the new \"border surge\" provisions that would double the number of agents on the u.s.-mexico border or the new money to construct a 700-mile-long fence.  but he raised questions on whether that plan would be enough to address concerns among conservatives, saying, \"if we're going to get the kind of bipartisan support i think we need, and we're not going to get that confidence unless the american people look up and say, 'yes, this border security package meets the straight-face test.' \" another key house gop player on immigration reform, judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte, r-virginia, was skeptical that the senate's border security plan was going to work, telling reporters, \"just throwing bodies at it\" does not solve the problem. goodlatte said the larger issue is addressing the 35%-45% of the 11 million people in the u.s. without legal status who he says enter the country lawfully -- through visas, but are allowed to overstay or gain a waiver to remain.  he argued there has to be a bigger emphasis on interior enforcement programs.  and goodlatte repeated his intention to move immigration reform through a \"step by step\" process instead of the sort of comprehensive bill the senate is considering. navarrette: border security push is a joke . \"anything attached to a path to citizenship even if it secures the border i wouldn't support it,\" pennsylvania republican rep. lou barletta said when asked by cnn about the senate's new border security plan.  barletta said he could support additional resources but said he wanted \"a guarantee\" that enforcement measures in fact worked, and he thought what the senate was doing would end up speeding up eventual citizenship for undocumented workers, something he said was unacceptable. \"i don't have any confidence that it's ever going to be implemented, \" iowa republican rep. steve king told cnn when asked about the senate border security plan, saying he didn't believe secretary of homeland security janet napolitano would follow the law. the dynamic inside the house republican conference on immigration could be seen outside the capitol on wednesday afternoon with two groups delivering polar opposite messages about immigration policy. house gop conference chair cathy mcmorris rogers, r-washington, held a news conference with several house republicans and a group of hispanic religious leaders and stressed the party's outreach efforts to latinos on immigration.  just yards away, the loud voices of a hundreds of activists opposed to a path to citizenship -- branded \"amnesty\" -- could be heard at an event king organized. boehner already made it clear earlier in the week that he would only move an immigration bill if it had the support of the majority of house republicans.  but even if he gets more than half of the 234 house gop members, he'll still needs to rely on house democratic leader nancy pelosi to get most of her members on board to pass a bill. democratic support for immigration reform has never been in question.  but house republican congressional aides, still incensed about the failure of the farm bill, question whether democrats on capitol hill are more focused on scoring political points in the next election than joining with them to pass a bill. \"how are we supposed to trust a promise or a whip count from house democrats now?\" one senior house gop leadership aide said when asked about what the farm bill's defeat means on immigration. walter noted that all along many republicans on the hill have been suspicious about how serious congressional democrats were about actually getting an immigration bill over the finish line. \"it speaks to this deep seeded belief among many republicans that democrats are going to pull the rug out from them and use it to beat them about the head in 2014,\" walter explained to cnn. the senate could be on track to pass its immigration package before july 4, but the bipartisan group in the house that has been working for months on a similar proposal hasn't been able to finalize their deal yet. the house judiciary committee has begun working on more narrow proposals aimed at enforcement and security, and those could come up for votes as early as next month. even those in the house who are pressing for major immigration reform say it's unlikely to play out in the house until later this fall. but that schedule poses difficult decisions for boehner about how to move immigration as it comes around the same time as the house has to deal with an equally divisive issue -- addressing how to deal with the country's debt limit. biden urges final push on immigration reform . [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":"- The Senate may be making progress on immigration reform, but the House is facing significant opposition from Republicans, particularly from conservative members. House Speaker John Boehner has expressed skepticism about the Senate's plan and has made it clear that he will only move forward on immigration reform if it has the support of a majority of House Republicans.\nDespite this, House Democrats have expressed their support for immigration reform, but their cooperation may be necessary for any bill to pass. The failure of the farm bill has raised questions about the viability of compromise legislation in the House, and some Republicans are skeptical that the Senate's border security plan will be enough to address concerns about illegal immigration.\nHouse Republicans are pushing for a step-by-step approach to immigration reform, while some Democrats are advocating for a comprehensive approach. The dynamic within the House Republican conference on immigration is complex, with some members expressing opposition to a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers, while others are pushing for additional resources for border security.\nOverall, the prospects for immigration reform in the House remain uncertain, and it may be difficult for any bill to pass without significant support from both parties."}

(you may need to cut slits into the perimeter of the template and overlap it so it conforms to the roundness.) using an awl, a pushpin, or a t pin, prick every ⅛ to ¼ inch along the outlines of the template. then remove the template, but keep it for reference. martha stewart living: no-mess one-bowl desserts: 12 recipes for lazy bakers . create the design . use linoleum cutters to scrape the pumpkin skin. start with the outline of the design and work inward. for details, use a no. 1 or no. 2 blade. for larger areas, use a no. 3 or no. 5 blade. scrape in the same direction in each section to keep the lines unified. pumpkin-carving tools . look beyond the knife drawer to implements intended for other uses -- say, a melon baller or a keyhole saw. these pumpkin-carving tools will make carving an easy task for you and your guests. how to carve pumpkins with kids . try a new approach to pumpkin carving with smaller kids: have children use their own drawings to create a template. first, sketch a design on a piece of paper and cut out the pieces of the face separately. next, tape the parts to the hollowed-out pumpkin. (note that as you're going from paper to pumpkin, you may have to interpret the layout of the face a little differently.) then trace the lines of the template by pokingholes with a needle tool. guide your kids if they need help with sharp tools. last, remove the template and carve along the dotted patterns with a miniature saw. martha stewart living: instant organization: get it together in 15 minutes or less . party menu and favors . when the crew starts feeling as hollow as their creations, let them break for fall fare, including sage popcorn in handheld portions. the trio of cheddar, gruyere, and fontina gives mac and cheese layers of sophisticated flavor, but it's still informal and delicious for all. the single servings make it easy to hold and carry. grown-ups can warm up with a hot whiskey sour with nocello, a walnut-flavored liqueur that adds a nutty twist. sweet-potato soup gets its smoky essence from chipotle and a bit of crunch from a topping of salted pepitas; served in a mug, it's portable and hand-warming. make sure to save room for dessert, a tasty sundae with an apple \"bowl\" that's been hollowed out to accommodate a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a drizzle of homemade caramel sauce, and toasted walnuts. make a classic bundt cake, baked with caramelized apples, walnuts, and spices, to await the partygoers; the glaze is made with apple cider. for party favors or treats, fill crepe-paper pumpkin pouches with tiny toys and candy eggs. keep your party treats somewhere special. transform a few hollowed-out pumpkins into candy jar creatures by sawing open pumpkin tops and placing a bowl inside. guests will love this witch who thinks she's gourd-geous. the party doesn't have to end once guests have finished carving their pumpkins. browse our best pumpkin-seed crafts and recipes, including a pumpkin bird feeder, a pumpkin seed necklace, and more creative ideas to keep the gathering going. martha stewart living: curb your food cravings with yoga .

You get straight to the point.\n<<\/SYS>>\n\ncreate a summary of the news article: (cnn) -- back in july 1969, i stood on the talcum-like lunar dust just a few feet from our home away from home, eagle, the lunar module that transported neil armstrong and me to the bleak, crater-pocked moonscape. standing there and soaking in the view, i called it as i saw it: \"magnificent desolation.\" as neil and i walked upon the surface of the moon at tranquility base, we satisfied a vision held by humankind for centuries. and as inscribed on the plaque fastened to the ladder of our lander: \"we came in peace for all mankind.\" sunday will mark the 45th anniversary of the lunar landing, when neil announced, \"tranquility base here. the eagle has landed.\" it was, truly, one small step, but more steps are needed to fuel and assure america's leadership role in deep space exploration. i'm often asked just how lonely it was on the moon. first of all, what got us there was the tireless effort of some 400,000 people who shared a universal dream. project apollo was a unified enterprise that relied on teamwork. second, while we were farther away from terra firma than any humans had ever ventured -- with our colleague mike collins circling the moon in the command module above us -- the three of us were connected to home planet earth. close to a billion people watched and listened to our journey. in reflecting back on that thrilling, transformative time, several things come to mind. standing on that harsh, desolate, yet magnificent terrain, stealing precious moments, i looked back at earth. everything i knew and loved lay suspended on a far away and fragile blue sphere that was engulfed by the blackness of space. in the back of my mind were neil's words about a step on the moon. imagine the great magnificence of humanity going from horse and buggy, to railroads, cars, and airplanes, to rockets -- and now walking on the moon. that is a testimonial to the progress of the creatures here on earth. i couldn't have imagined anything more desolate -- knowing it hadn't changed in hundreds of thousands of years. you couldn't find any place like that on earth. the airlessness. brilliant sunlight illuminated the dust, which was everywhere. and the horizon, visibly curving away in the distance, was so clear because no pollution obscured it. walking across that landscape was much easier than we had thought it would be. when my boot struck moon dust, it flew away in a straight line, a sign of the lighter gravity load, one-sixth that of earth. i didn't anticipate, returning to earth, that america's triumph was viewed as a success for all humankind. people expressed their collective pride by declaring \"we did it!\" -- there was an aura of ownership of the achievement. although we can revel in taking rear-view mirror looks at the apollo 11 mission, the urgent need, i believe, is to confront the future. our space program should not focus on getting back to the moon. we have already blazed that trail. apollo was part of a clear, get-there-in-a-hurry, space race strategy. to be blunt, that meant we didn't spend time developing re-usability. it's time for commercial and international interests to move, beyond discovery, to development. other nations, china in particular, are working toward the exploration and development of the moon with robots and, eventually, crews. providing u.s. support for international lunar development is in our best interest. by participating in a unified, international effort, we avoid an unnecessary race back to the moon and can still participate in lunar science. other u.s. government entities -- the national science foundation and commercial entities -- should take over in moon exploitation and development. it may well be that nasa is not best suited to run this program. exploitation has never been its strong point. it's true, multiple choices need to be made. we could as a country sit around and do nothing. on the other hand, we could accept the role of space leadership that we carved out for ourselves in the 1960s and 1970s. for america, another destination is calling. america's longer-term goal should be permanent human presence on mars. the moment to begin could be on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of apollo 11's touchdown on the moon. we can make a courageous, kennedyesque commitment to america's future in deep space. the u.s. president could utter these momentous words: \"i believe this nation should commit itself, within two decades, to commencing an america-led, permanent presence on the planet mars.\" we must look to re-establish realistic, but ambitious, longer range and more meaningful exploration goals, and we must issue a call -- with the right guidance and sustained funding -- to a new generation. the next generation of space explorers. again, the apollo moon program provided one small step. other steps lay ahead, strides that take us to the surface of mars. catching the summer of supermoons . scientists create a mini mars on earth . looking up at mesmerizing stars .

In a CNN article, Buzz Aldrin reflects on the 45th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, in which he and Neil Armstrong became the first humans to walk on the lunar surface. Aldrin describes the experience of standing on the \"magnificent desolation\" of the moon's surface, feeling a sense of awe and wonder at the vastness of space and the fragility of Earth. He notes that while the Apollo 11 mission was a historic achievement for America, it was also a testament to the progress of humanity as a whole. Aldrin argues that the US should focus on developing a permanent presence on Mars, rather than returning to the moon, and calls for sustained funding and guidance to support a new generation of space explorers."}

'it's really more to weaken a title on a label that we've worked very hard for,' said jeff arnett, the master distiller at the jack daniel's distillery in lynchburg, tenn. 'as a state, i don't think tennessee should be bashful about being protective of tennessee whiskey over say bourbon or scotch or any of the other products that we compete with.' republican state rep. bill sanderson emphasized that his bill wouldn't do away with last year's law enacted largely on the behest of jack daniel's corporate parent, louisville, ky.,-based brown-forman corp. the principal change would be to allow tennessee whiskey makers to reuse barrels, which he said would present considerable savings over new ones that can cost $600 each. 'there are a lot of ways to make high-quality whiskey, even if it's not necessarily the way jack daniel's does it,' sanderson said. 'what gives them the right to call theirs tennessee whiskey, and not others?' sanderson acknowledged that he introduced the measure at diageo's urging, but said it would also help micro distilleries opening across the state. diageo picked up on the same theme. 'this isn't about diageo, as all of our tennessee whiskey is made with new oak,' said diageo executive vice president guy l. smith iv. 'this is about brown-forman trying to stifle competition and the entrepreneurial spirit of micro distillers. 'we are not sure what they are afraid of, as we feel new innovative products from a new breed of distillers is healthy for the entire industry,' he said. special blend: jeff arnett, the master distiller at the jack daniel distillery in lynchburg, tennessee tests the aroma of whiskey at the distillery. jack daniel's is fighting efforts in the state legislature to dial back the legal definition of tennessee whiskey, including a provision that requires the spirit to be aged in new oak barrels . jack daniel's last year sold 11.5 million cases of it black label last year, a 5 percent increase from 2012. dickel, the second-largest tennessee whiskey producer, sold 130,000 cases in 2013. the standards and special branding of tennessee whiskey are an outgrowth of the special designation granted long ago to bourbon. a half-century ago, congress declared bourbon a distinctive product of the united states. by law, bourbon must be made of a grain mix of at least 51 percent corn, distilled at less than 160 proof, have no additives except water to reduce the proof and be aged in new, charred white oak barrels. spirits that don't follow those guidelines can't be sold as bourbon. one example is brown-forman's own early times, which is marketed as a 'kentucky whisky' because it is made in reused barrels. billy kaufman, the president short mountain distillery in woodbury, tenn., said it is more difficult to distinguish spirits not meeting the tennessee standard. 'if i made whiskey in tennessee in a used barrel, what it would be called then?' he said. 'whiskey, made in tennessee?' david mcmahan, a lobbyist representing dickel and popcorn sutton distilling, said the law passed last year would require all tennessee whiskies to taste like jack daniel's. preparing to fight: a law that was introduced last year says the whiskey must be made in a way that resembles almost to the letter the process used to make jack daniel's . 'it's not unlike if the beer guys 25 years ago had said all american beer has to be made like budweiser,' mcmahan said. 'you never would have a sam adams or a yazoo or any of those guys.' but tennessee craft distillers are divided about the state law. charles nelson, the ceo of nelson's green brier distillery in nashville, said he supports tighter regulation. 'holding ourselves to a higher standard will ultimately be better for all the people in the category,' he said. 'if we lower the standards, it could lead to more products and brands that could lower the reputation of tennessee whiskey.' whiskey is clear when it goes into the barrel. it's during the aging process that the whiskey acquires color and flavors. jack daniel's arnett said other distillers reusing barrels might resort to using artificial colorings and flavorings that wouldn't match the quality of the whiskey stored in new barrels. 'we've been making whiskey a long time, and we know that would not uphold the quality that people expect from tennessee whiskey,' he said. 'so we wouldn't dare consider doing it, even though it would save us millions of dollars every year.' change in the law? lawmakers are looking at amending that law so that some of the craft distillers that have sprung up in recent years can label their products tennessee whiskey, a distinctive and popular draw in the booming american liquor business. the people behind jack daniel's see the hand of a bigger rival at work, however, the foreign-owned conglomerate that makes george dickel, another famed tennessee brand . jack daniel's stores its whiskey in new barrels made at a brown-forman plant. sanderson argues that the flavor and color of the whiskey is determined more by the charring of the inside of the barrels, which he said is a process that can be repeated. consumers would ultimately decide whether the end product matches up. 'if they're making an inferior product, the market will decide,' he said. [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":".

'and i remind him, when it comes to housing benefit, under his side housing benefit pretty near doubled in ten years and it was set to rise far more than it'll rise under us.' mr byrne said the housing benefit bill was set to rise by 'an extraordinary' £4billion over the course of four years. he said: 'now what we do not want on top of that is another bill for council tax payers to clean up the cost of homelessness. the issue began to trend on twitter this morning with many explaining their exasperation over the level being set at £26,000 .

'i don't believe they should. and i think the overwhelming majority of people in the country would back that view.\" speaking in leeds mr cameron said the £35,000 equivalent wage was a 'good, healthy salary'. as ministers faced a concerted challenge to their welfare reforms, opposition spokesman lord mckenzie of luton said his party backed the cap but it had to be 'based on fairness\"'. in report stage debate on the welfare reform bill, he told peers: 'a particular concern for us is its potential to drive increased homelessness.' labour, with the backing of church of england bishops, want the government to exempt from the cap those threatened with homelessness because of its introduction. but work and pensions minister lord freud defended the cap, insisting households should not be able to receive more in benefits than the average family earned from work. 'people on benefits should face the same choices as working families, including where they can afford to live,' he said. the cap was welcomed by the centre for social justice think tank, which was founded by mr duncan smith in opposition. executive director gavin poole said: 'members of the house of lords should think twice about opposing a reform that will help tackle child poverty in the uk. 'our present system traps families in dependency on state handouts and sends a corrosive message to the two million children who live in workless households. 'deprived of the role model of a parent who goes out to work and earns a living, many of these children will simply repeat this stultifying, destructive cycle, graduating to an adult life on benefits. 'by capping benefits at the level of average income and by restoring the incentive to work, ministers are taking a major step towards ending intergenerational poverty and giving young people the chance to make something of their lives.

through the british political establishment, led to dozens of arrests on suspicion of criminal activity and forced news corp. to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking. tuesday's hearing revealed the depth of the links between the murdoch family and british politicians, with murdoch saying he had had drinks with david cameron at a pub before cameron became prime minister and dined with him once he was in office. leveson inquiry lawyer robert jay pressed murdoch over the extent of his contact with politicians as the company moved to take full

that he did not decide what went into the company's british tabloids, the sun and the news of the world, relying on his editors to make the decisions. he was also pressed on his relationship with british politicians, including former prime minister tony blair and the current leader, cameron. he acknowledged meeting with them, but denied having lobbied them improperly about his family's

The scandal has led to dozens of arrests, criminal investigations, and police asking prosecutors to charge at least eight people. The British government set up the Leveson Inquiry in response to the scandal, and two parliamentary committees are also looking into media conduct."}

the debate over female bishops started soon after women were ordained as priests 20 years ago. the cofe set up the committees and inquiries that led to yesterday’s vote in 2000. what went on before? the vote in the general synod that was meant to finally approve women bishops ended in narrow defeat for reformers in november 2012. who is opposed? anglo-catholics, who believe the bible and tradition do not allow women bishops, and conservative evangelicals, who believe the bible says women should not be church leaders. what is different now? in 2012, it was felt there were too few provisions for those opposed to female bishops. but church leaders have now drawn up a new compromise, including a dispute procedure. how does the new plan work? the cofe has laid out principles saying that women shall have the full powers of male bishops and that everyone must recognise the decision. all dioceses, even those dominated by traditionalists, must include a junior bishop who will ordain and promote women. but it recognises that opponents of women bishops have the right to ‘flourish’ – so there must be ‘pastoral and sacramental provision’ for disputes. what about disputes? church councils which oppose the move can send their bishop a resolution stating that they do not want a woman vicar or clergy, nor any male priests who have been ordained by women bishops. they should then be sent male clergy when jobs become vacant. if an objecting parish is in a diocese run by a woman bishop, she will allow it to be supervised by a male junior bishop. if no junior bishop is available within the diocese, one can be brought in from outside. what if there are still arguments? there will be an appeals system, in which parishes can turn to an ‘independent reviewer’. but if a parish does not accept an appeal decision they can be subject to disciplinary action, which can culminate in dismissal from the church. sally barnes, pictured right, is overwhelmed with emotion beside hilary cotton after the synod in york . the first appointment may be seen as an anti-climax, with a woman picked to fill a junior post, subordinate to a male bishop. after . the vote, the archbishop of york led the general synod in a rendition . of we are marching in the light of god, with members clapping along, . some even shedding tears of joy. reverend . dr rosemarie mallett, from southwark diocese, said yesterday: ‘i’m . absolutely joyful, thank god after 20 years of very hard work we now . have a decision that can help us work for everyone in the church. yesterday’s vote came nearly 20 months after the church’s last attempt to approve a law allowing women bishops. the lost synod vote in november 2012 left the then archbishop of canterbury, rowan williams, humiliated and apparently with little hope of reviving the cause for several years. but a new compromise, which allows scope for traditionalists to challenge the appointment of a female bishop in their parish, was brought to the vote in record time. the plan is based on the hope of compromise between opposing liberals and conservatives. archbishop welby said cofe members must ‘continue to demonstrate love for those who disagree on theological grounds’. he added: ‘as delighted as i am for the outcome of this vote i am also mindful of those within the church for whom the result will be difficult and a cause of sorrow.’ during the debate, guildford traditionalist adrian vincent said he would reverse his position from 2012 and vote in favour. ‘by doing so, i am betraying what i believe, i am betraying those who trusted in me,’ he said. ‘i hope that the promised commitment to mutual flourishing is not a commitment that will run out of steam in a few years.’ but opponent dr chik kaw tan, of lichfield, said: ‘men and women are equal but their roles are not interchangeable ... if we allow the church to be guided by secular thinking our teaching will soon unravel.’ in 2012, the house of laity voted just six short of the necessary two to one majority. yesterday, it voted 152 to 45 for women bishops. members of the clergy arrive for the general synod of church of england meeting at the university of york . the archbishop of canterbury arrived for the general synod of church of england meeting at the university of york today . deputy prime minister nick clegg welcomed the 'watershed moment' for the church of england, after the synod overwhelmingly backed the measure to scrap the ban . more than two thirds of the members of the church of england's synod, pictured here during morning prayers this morning, voted for the consecration of women bishops . the most rev justin welby said the church had been wrong on women bishops 'theologically' for centuries . the archbishop of canterbury said he would be 'delighted' to see a woman take his role in his lifetime .

You get straight to the point.\n<<\/SYS>>\n\ncreate a summary of the news article: in america, summer holds a special place in our hearts: lazy afternoons, camping at the lake, warm evenings gazing at the moon. for children, especially, summer can unleash the free flow of discovery. for older children, summer often brings their first job. but this idyllic picture masks the reality that for too many children, particularly those from low-income families, languid summers can be educationally detrimental, and for families in which both parents work, summers are a logistical nightmare. considerable research shows that the primary reason the achievement gap between poor children and their more affluent peers widens over the course of their school careers is the long break in learning over the summer. it's called summer slide. during the school year, disadvantaged children manage to catch up somewhat to more advantaged students. but during the summer, they lose those gains while their more advantaged peers -- whose parents can afford to arrange for summer enriching activities -- maintain theirs.  and a persistent achievement gap among children only leads to economic and social gaps that continue into adulthood. these gaps destabilize our society. surely, eliminating the long summer break by making our school year longer, at least for schools serving poor neighborhoods, seems a ready solution to a problem that has enormously negative implications. an analysis of charter schools in new york by economist caroline hoxby revealed that students are most likely to outperform peers, both in traditional district schools and at other charters,  if they attend schools that are open at least 10 days more than the conventional year. families with resources can often find educational summer programs and camps that broaden their children's skills and then figure out how to transport children to these activities. but even so, the question remains: does it really make sense for children to be out of school for up to 12 weeks in the summer? requiring students (and teachers, for that matter) to stay in school for more days is complicated and must overcome at least two significant obstacles. first, more days of school usually carries a price tag to cover costs of additional staff time, transportation and keeping buildings running. second, although public attitudes are changing, overhauling such an ingrained institution as the long summer break won't be accomplished easily. the response to the first issue is to weigh the long-term costs of the summer break against the short-term costs of a longer school year. balsz elementary school district in phoenix, for example, has extended its school year to 200 days, paying teachers 9% more to work the additional days. since the longer year has been implemented, proficiency rates on state tests have risen, failure rates have fallen, and the achievement gap is disappearing. clearly, the relatively small increase in budget yields large dividends for the students who attend. students graduating middle school proficient in algebra and reading have opportunities open to them that are simply nonexistent for students at risk of  failure. then consider the brooklyn generation school in new york, which has developed a model in which the students in grades nine through 12 attend for 200 days, but the teachers, on staggered schedules, are there for only 180. that means they earn salaries equal to their peers throughout the city. there is no shortage of innovation that can bring the benefits of a longer year to students. and what of the idea that summer should be a time of respite from the stresses of school? there are two wrong notions wrapped up in this perspective. the first is that somehow summer is automatically a magical time for children. such may be the case for children from middle- and upper-class homes, but for those whose families can't afford camp or other activities, summer is often a time of emptiness and tedium. as one balsz fifth-grader, happy to be back at school in august, declared, \"sometimes summer is really boring. we just sit there and watch tv.\" the second, more significant, misperception is that school is automatically bereft of the excitement and joy of learning. on the contrary, as the national center on time and learning describes in its studies of schools that operate with significantly more time, educators use the longer days and years to enhance the content and methods of the classroom. it provides more openings for hands-on learning, student collaboration and inquiry-based learning, where students push themselves to learn. why shouldn't children have these same opportunities during the summer as they do in cooler months? it is true that just having more time, whether it's more days during the year or more hours during the day, does not guarantee a superior education. educators must use that extra time well and be committed to addressing individual students' needs and not waver in their drive for excellence. yet, we do know that teachers who lack sufficient time with students, and students who spend too much time away from productive learning, are fighting an uphill battle in an environment where we hold increasingly high expectations for our children. there is no reason to scale back these expectations. our future as a nation depends upon having a well-informed, highly skilled work force and citizenry. we should expect our schools to furnish today's students with the education they will need to excel in our global society. but we must also be willing to provide schools the tools they need to ensure this outcome, including the flexibility to turn the lazy days of summer into the season of learning. follow @cnnopinion on twitter . [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":". In America, summer is often seen as a time of relaxation and fun for children, but it can also have a negative impact on their education. Research has shown that the long summer break can lead to a widening of the achievement gap between low-income and high-income students, as disadvantaged children lose the gains they made during the school year. This can have long-term consequences for their academic success and social mobility. Some schools have responded to this problem by extending their school year, either by adding days to the calendar or by providing summer programs that provide educational activities for students. While there are challenges to implementing a longer school year, such as increased costs and resistance from parents, there is evidence that it can lead to improved academic outcomes for students. Ultimately, it is important to find ways to provide students with access to high-quality educational opportunities throughout the year, rather than relying solely on the summer months for learning."}

'do you think tracey cared about the children when she stashed them in the room 15 feet from where she fired 11 shots?' said sac county attorney ben smith today. 'she should have lost any and all rights to make those kinds of decisions or to have an influence in her kids' lives when she executed somebody.' tracey richter is pictured during her first-degree murder trial in fort dodge, iowa. the mother who is serving life in prison for killing a neighbor in 2001 has been granted continued visitation rights with her two minor children, who were present in the rural iowa home during the execution-style slaying . in the ruling issued last week, judge whittenburg said roberts cannot move to his native australia with his 14-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl until richter's appeals are exhausted, even though roberts claims his temporary visa has already expired. sac county attorney ben smith said thursday that it is unbelievable richter maintains parental rights after a jury convicted her of shooting 20-year-old dustin wehde at their home in early in 2001 while the children – then 3 and 1 – were one room away. judge whittenburg said the 14-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl have a 'long, positive history with their mother,' whom she called an excellent parent. she said the visits will help 'bring closure to the sudden and traumatic events of the past year' in which richter was arrested and convicted of killing wehde as part of a plot to frame her first husband, john pitman, who is the father of her child bert, for a home invasion. ten-years ago tracey roberts was celebrated as a heroic mother who acted in self-defence to protect herself and her children from men who broke into her home in early, iowa and assaulted her. dustin wehde, her neighbour was found slumped at the bottom of a bed at tracey and michael roberts’ home in december 2001 in a pool of blood. one bullet had gone through his head and out of his eye socket. noah and mason roberts pictured with their mother tracey richter in this undated photograph (left) now live with their father michael roberts (right) she claimed that with her husband on a business trip, she was home with her three young children - bert, noah and mason - when dustin and another man barged through her unlocked door. roberts said one of the men choked her with panty hose, she lost her glasses and blacked out and woke to the sound of bert screaming, who was holding a baseball bat to protect his younger siblings. she said she ran to the bedroom and reached for the gun safe, as dustin tugged at her hair and yanked on her feet. when the safe opened, she grabbed a 9mm handgun and pulled the trigger. then she said she grabbed a revolver, spotted dustin moving and fired at him. he stopped moving and the second man fled. she later said it was only one man, not two, who got away. her attorney picked up on inconsistencies in roberts's story as she retold it. in different accounts, she said she fired from different positions. house: this photo shows the home of tracey . roberts in early, iowa. in 2001, she fired nine shots from two guns into . dustin wehde, a 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her . bedroom . murder trial: tracey roberts, now 46, left, . fired nine shots from two guns into dustin wehde, right, in 2001 - a . 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom . in january, 2011 sac county had a new prosecutor in ben smith, who went through years of files and months later filed a first-degree murder charge against roberts, who is now called tracey richter. and in november 2011 a court in iowa found that richter shot wehde several times at close range in the back of the head in her bedroom, and concocted an elaborate hoax that she acted in self-defense to protect her children after wehde and another man attacked her. it was established by the court that richter wanted to frame her first husband and father of her first child and paint him as the man who in fact hired wehde as a hitman to kill richter. the court heard this was because he was attempting to take sole custody of his child and was threatening to cut of the $1,000 in child support he was paying monthly to richter. and then a key piece of evidence emerged - a pink spiral notebook that had been recovered from wehde's car. in wehde's handwriting, it suggested he had been hired as a hit-man by a ‘mysterious fellow’ named john pitman iii, who was tracey's first husband. they split up four years after marrying in 1988. 'j.p. wants me to get\/force his ex t.r. to kill her son burt and then commit suicide, and if that plan fails plan b is to make it appear as though t.r. had committed the murder of her son & then committed suicide,' he wrote. tracey richter was found guilty of an elaborate ruse to frame her first husband who was threatening to cut of alimony payments . originally tracey richter was hailed as a hero for protecting her children against a home invasion but after the tireless work of sac county attorney ben smith her guilt was established in the murder of dustin wehde . but investigators never believed it was credible. dustin, a special education student, did not like to write and he had never met mr pitman. prosecutors suspect she had convinced dustrin to write the diary, perhaps on the day he died. roberts, on a business trip during the shooting, initially stood by his wife's account. but the two eventually divorced and richter took primary custody of their children until her arrest last year. roberts then moved with the children to a california city he has not disclosed, saying he fears for their safety. and days after her conviction, richter was caught sending letters containing roberts' social security number and other information that could be used to find him to an incarcerated wisconsin sex offender. the female judge has ruled that because richter held sole custody of her children for the ten years before her arrest she has a unique relationship with her children that needs to be preserved . a crucial piece of evidence that was presented during richter's trial in october was a pink notebook that the prosecution claimed was written by richter and not wehde - who suffered from learning difficulties . judge whittenburg ruled that richter's contact with the inmate was 'not consistent with the duties imposed on a joint legal custodian.' but she said roberts didn't present enough evidence to justify hiding in california, saying: 'it is michael who has created the distance and hardship that is attendant to visiting tracey in iowa.' whittenburg ordered roberts to disclose their address so richter can send her children mail, including tapes of her reading them books. in addition to the visits, richter was granted 30-minute phone conversations on the kids' birthdays. roberts' attorney, eric borseth, said he was considering appealing the decision, which he called the first of its kind in iowa. borseth said he was also exploring settlement options that would allow roberts and the children to return to australia, where he has employment opportunities and family support. remembered: the grave site for dustin wehde in . holstein, iowa. seen through the middle of the heart is the gravestone . of his father, brett, who committed suicide at that spot the year after . his son's death . 'we were disappointed in the ruling, primarily because we didn't believe it was in the best interests of the children to be visiting her at the prison,' borseth said. 'the biggest concern we have, other than the trauma of going to a prison and seeing your mom there, is that mom and her family have continued to blame michael for the predicament she's in.' smith, the prosecutor, said he believed the decision did not consider roberts' rights as a father. 'it's just mindboggling how somebody that is convicted of murder, fraud and perjury still gets a say,' he said. 'and not only does she get a say, the spouse is ordered to travel 1,500 miles to facilitate visitation with the very person that was convicted of the murder but yet blames him for it. can you imagine?'

You get straight to the point.\n<<\/SYS>>\n\ncreate a summary of the news article: few predictions are certain when it comes to the future of air travel ... except this one. it looks like being a lot more comfortable. a british company has come up with adjustable plane seats you can book to suit your shape and size. it means larger passengers need not worry about squeezing into uncomfortable, tight spaces, moving to business class or paying double – they just book an expanded seat to fit them. and families can enjoy more comfortable flights without taking up more overall space – mothers and fathers can add a few notches to their seats while smaller children can have theirs scaled down. the morph, as the seat has been called,  also allows for the possibility of slimmer travellers paying less for occupying smaller spaces. the design by london firm seymourpowell has already attracted attention from plane manufacturers such as boeing and airbus. details of passengers' sizes and needs will be fed into a computer and airline staff then adjust the varied seating arrangements at a touch of a button before take-off. morph works by replacing the traditional foam pads used in airline seats with a fabric that is stretched across the width of three seats, around a frame and over formers, a little like a hi-tech hammock. it promises comfort without reducing leg room . unlike traditional seats, which are created individually using foam padding, the new design is based around a single piece of fabric stretched across the back of a frame for three seats. another piece of fabric is placed along the bottom, creating a hammock-style chair. the frame includes ‘formers’ which move up or down underneath the fabric, allowing the passenger to alter the recline, as well as the height and depth of the seat pan, according to their size and comfort. crucially, the formers, which act as arm rests and dividers between the three seats, can also be moved left or right to alter their width, making the seats bigger or smaller. economy class airline seats are, on average, around 18in wide. squeezing into a small airline seat could become a thing of the past, but larger people might have to pay more for their airline seat if the new morph concept becomes a reality . but the morph seats would allow, for example, a couple travelling with a young child to book two larger 22in seats to improve their comfort, while the child would occupy a smaller and cheaper 10in seat. jeremy white, of seymourpowell, admitted that some airlines were resistant to charging people according to their size, but claimed passengers would welcome improved choice. larger travellers could see it as a better option than being charged twice over. ‘one airline told us that if they have an oversized passenger, they make them buy two seats,’ he said. ‘i can’t think of anything more degrading or humiliating than forcing someone to buy two seats because they are a bit wide.’ the seats can be reclined and adjusted to suit an individual's preferred seated position by moving the seat 'formers', which in turn morphs the fabric to provide a 'tailored fit and greater comfort,' according to the firm . mr white said the seats can also be adjusted to suit other needs such as privacy for lone travellers,  mothers with children, people working or less abled passengers. the seats are unlikely to be fitted into existing aircraft, so it could be more than a decade before the morph design is introduced. however, some airlines have already adopted similar seating plans. air new zealand’s dreamliners feature ‘skycouches’, a row of three economy seats that can be turned into a sofa. and earlier this year airbus announced it would be offering an additional two inches on some aisle seats on its new a320 jets to keep up with ‘demographic trends’. analysts have suggested imposing a ‘fat tax’ on passengers above a certain weight to cope with demands from larger passengers. in april, samoa air became the first airline to operate a ‘pay-by-weight’ system. [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":", The future of air travel may be more comfortable for passengers of all shapes and sizes, thanks to a new seat design that can be adjusted to fit individual needs. The \"Morph\" seat, created by London-based design firm Seymourpowell, features a stretchy fabric that can be adjusted to accommodate passengers of different sizes. The seat can be reclined and adjusted to suit an individual's preferred seated position, and can also be adjusted to provide greater comfort and privacy for passengers. The design has already attracted attention from plane manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus, and could potentially be introduced on new aircraft within the next decade. Some airlines have already adopted similar seating plans, such as Air New Zealand's \"Skycouches\" and Airbus's additional aisle seats. However, analysts have suggested that imposing a \"fat tax\" on larger passengers may be a more practical solution to accommodate their needs."}

'when we get our radar data back the day after the flyby, we will have the first detailed images,' said radar astronomer lance benner of jpl, the principal investigator for the goldstone radar observations of the asteroid.

'i may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself,' said yeomans. 'asteroids are something special. not only did asteroids provide earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources.

rolling out her video for the released-in-december \"army of love\" with video diaries building up to a december 22 premiere. \"it's like euro trash meets angels singing in a choir,\" kerli said of \"army of love,\" which continues to draw interest online because of the video, which has a curious mix of swirling melodies set against striking visuals (the clip was shot in estonia). adventurous college radio listeners have long been boosters of acts from the baltic states and other european countries, but mainstream pop fans rarely hear singers such as kerli on the u.s. pop charts. and while european artists who have \"made it\" overseas have been buying second homes in the hollywood hills for decades, more interesting are the new pop singers living nearby, such as slovakia's twiins, who are hoping against odds to make a name for themselves in america after a modicum of success elsewhere. the duo, who are identical twins, moved to l.a. last year. they are currently working on their first record for l.a.-based indie label b records with known u.s. producers including bryan todd, who has worked with names such as jordin sparks. \"we love los angeles because of the weather, nice people and shopping, but the main reason why we moved is our work,\" veronika nízlové said via email last month. her twin sister daniela added the transition has not been easy. \"it's really hard to come from eastern europe and try to achieve success in america. we are not native speakers, we are not americans...it's a little disadvantage to us, but our big advantage is that we are twins. \" twiins, which scored a minor european hit last year with a remake of sabrina salerno's 1980s hit \"boys,\" seem already savvy to the city's sometimes cruel undercurrent. in their forthcoming single \"welcome to hollywood,\" the pair warn other aspiring singers that not everything is sunshine and smiles in the city of angels. \"the song is not about the perfect hollywood,\" veronika said, \"it's about people with their 'friendly faces' which is far from being true. you should have open eyes and be careful whom you trust. hollywood and all that goes along with it really has two sides to it.\" sage advice from los angeles' latest émigrés, who sing on their soon-to-be released single: \"welcome to hollywood\/boy you better give it up before it gets you down\/welcome to hollywood\/just got to get a grip of how to get around.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":"  * The article discusses the increasing number of European pop singers moving to Los Angeles to launch their careers in the US market.\n* The singers mentioned in the article include Kerli, Marco Bosco, Lena Katina, T.A.T.U.'s Lena Katina, Slovakia's Twiins, and Austria's Fawni.\n* The article highlights the challenges faced by these singers, including the language barrier, cultural differences, and the intense competition in the US market.\n* Despite these challenges, the article suggests that these singers are making progress in the US market, with some of them achieving moderate success and others gaining attention from industry professionals and media outlets.\n* The article also touches on the changing landscape of pop music, with the increasing globalization of the industry and the rise of online platforms such as YouTube.\n* The article concludes by highlighting the potential for these European singers to make a significant impact on the US pop scene in 2011."}

'we wanted to make sure we kept the jury focused on the conduct that led to these people's sickness, but not let the case get into the medical history of every victim out there' with testimony on individual deaths, moore said. defense attorneys have acknowledged the georgia plant shipped tainted peanut butter and covered up positive salmonella tests, but they say the scheme was carried out behind the backs of the parnell brothers by two plant managers who pleaded guilty. the three defendants, charged with 71 total counts, still face severe punishment if convicted. prosecutors have said stewart parnell faces a maximum of 754 years in prison and $17 million in fines. and moore said he intends to present evidence of the deaths during sentencing if there are convictions. the centers for disease control and prevention, which tracked the outbreak from victims back to the plant, determined 714 people got sick in 43 u.s. states. three deaths were reported in minnesota, two in ohio, two in virginia, one in idaho and one in north carolina. but the cdc hedged when tying fatalities to salmonella. 'the nine deaths reported are linked to the salmonella typhimurium outbreak, but were not definitively caused by salmonella,' the cdc said in a may 2009 report. marler said all nine who died tended to be older people with other problems that made them vulnerable to severe effects from food poisoning.

'then he puts the truck in drive, drives forward, running over him, and then keeps going forward and keeps on driving, and runs over carter, who is standing in the parking lot, and keeps on going after that,' corina said. he said witnesses told investigators it looked like an intentional act. authorities said they do not believe carter was involved in the altercation. blatt said knight was called to tam's burgers in compton by carter for a meeting and was attacked by four people, including sloan, as he slowed his truck. the men beat him through his window, tried to pull him outside, and threatened to kill him. knight punched the gas and fled in fear, blatt said. he had no idea he hit two men. corina said that claim is hard to believe, and there's no evidence thus far of four attackers. the incident came less than six months after knight was shot six times at a west hollywood nightclub in august — the second shooting he's survived. no arrests have been made. at 6-foot-4 and weighing 325 pounds, knight has a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited, in part, with helping create death row records when he strong-armed another label to release dr. dre from his contract, said chuck creekmur, ceo of allhiphop.com. knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting tupac shakur against biggie smalls in an east coast-versus-west coast rivalry. knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with shakur at a las vegas hotel, just hours before shakur was fatally shot while riding in knight's car just east of the strip. smalls, whose real name was chris wallace, was shot to death in a similar attack six months later. knight and dre later had a falling out, and dre left. the record company eventually declared bankruptcy and was auctioned off. dr. dre and ice cube, another former n.w.a. member, were at the film location thursday, but they didn't see knight. in november, knight pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed after a celebrity photographer accused him of stealing her camera in beverly hills. because of prior convictions, he could face up to 30 years in prison.

'obviously cahill and terry play together at chelsea, they play in the champions league and were contenders to win the premier league. 'as a defender, partnerships are important. if you have two players who work well together they may be a better bet than two superior players, so i can understand why people talk about terry. 'england's defence in the qualifiers was pretty decent, but i can't decide what people ask. i stop, smile and get on with it.' terry, 33, has always insisted he would never come out of international retirement and head coach roy hodgson hasn't even discussed it with him. first choice: jagielka and gary cahill look the likely to be the centre back pairing for england at the world cup . club class: cahill and john terry have formed a defensive partnership at chelsea . although england's defence does look vulnerable, jagielka and cahill will be hodgson's first pick at the world cup this summer. the everton defender has won 31 caps and is expected to face peru in england's world cup send-off at wembley on friday evening. he added: 'i still find it difficult assuming i'm going to play for england but i've played quite a lot in qualifying and have built up a good relationship with cahill. 'we haven't played together for a while and hopefully these three games will give us the chance to get that relationship going again. being in the squad is great, but nothing beats starting games for your country. it's what we all want to do and it looks like i've got a good chance of doing that at the moment.' getting down to business: england players joe hart and jagielka try and stop raheem sterling from scoring . jagielka also mounted an impassioned defence of young english footballers after monitoring the progress of everton midfielder ross barkley, plus raheem sterling and luke shaw this season. the england defender watched barcelona striker gerard deulofeu on loan at everton last season and claims he is no better than young english players. he added: 'gerard came in and he was quite a selfish player but he has a tremendous amount of ability and went past people. we are probably taught to be less selfish but technically there is no difference. young stars: raheem sterling and gerard deulofeu both had good seasons on merseyside . 'the ideal comparison is raheem to deulofeu and for me raheem had the best season. that is a direct comparison. 'it is too easy to point the finger but if you take a step back to what we have got, we have some tremendously talented individuals. 'if you look at ross, he has a good physique, is good in the air, eats the right food, and more importantly loves the game. you cannot get him off the training ground. he had a couple of injuries when he was younger which set him back a bit and he did not get to play that much football because he was not around the first team at a young age. looking good: ross barkley is one of the young england stars picked for the world cup . 'this season has proved how much he has grown mentally. he went through a bad period but the manager stood by him and he came out of it. he has got the whole package, but we don't want to put too much pressure on him.

'if there is anything that sars has taught china and its government, it's that one cannot be too careful or too honest when it comes to deadly pandemics.

'i think labour would wreck the recovery, and under the conservatives, who don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do, you’d get the wrong kind of recovery. 'so our message is: coalition is good; what the liberal democrats have done in government is good. let us finish the job, but let us finish it fairly.' the independent on sunday published a . poll conducted by the website liberal democrat voice, which found that . 39 per cent of activists questioned would prefer a lib dem-labour . coalition after 2015, compared with just 15 per cent who favour another . coalition with the conservatives. a further 15 per cent of those . questioned said that, in the event of a hung parliament, mr clegg's . party should forge a \"confidence and supply\" agreement with labour, . under which lib dems would not enter coalition but would undertake not . to bring down the minority government or vote against its budget. just 6 per cent wanted an arrangement of this kind with tories. mr . clegg predicted more coalitions in future, suggesting labour and the . conservatives will have to draw up a ‘shopping list’ manifesto, with a . handful of key policiies and others which could be haggled over during . coalition talks. he said: . ‘in my view it is going to more likely than not that in the future . you’re going to get more coalitions, it is less likely that you’re going . to these slam-dunk results when one or the other of the two major . parties always get a majority. ‘i . think it is incumbent on all political parties to be up front with the . british people – as we were  last time – about those issues which you . really will die in the trench for, and those which clearly will depend . on political and economic circumstances.’ blustery: many delegates were not well-prepared for the weather . wet wet wet: lib dem president tim farron (left) and pensions minister steve webb got caught out in the rain . in the pink: nick clegg boasted that his party was making a difference in government . he . said his focus was on returning to the lib dems to power in 2015, and . hinted at a desire to continue working with the tories on the economic . plan which is already underway.

'harry gets right in there and is pretty fearless when he plays, just like his personality. 'they say they love polo but can’t play as much as they’d like. they’re very sporty.' the princes’ team won 5-4 in the last few minutes of their game, with the event attended by a host of england celebrities including dame helen mirren and clive owen. alec couldn’t believe  the brothers, who introduced themselves casually as ‘will and harry’, were so normal. alec brown is a professional polo player, living in england and argentina for six months of the year. he grew up on his family property in nsw's upper hunter valley, with his grandparents and parents breeding and training polo horses . ‘i didn’t expect them to be the same as anyone else. 'my mouth was open most of the time. i was really nervous and i didn’t know what to ask them at first!'’ alec says that the duke of cambridge was particularly interested in alec’s australian background. ‘will said that he loved his time in australia but was so flat out. he said he wishes he’d had more time to relax and take it in.

'we’re under a lot of pressure to perform so it’s great to have someone there who you can ask for opinions.' alec brown (far left) hopes to see how far he can go competing professionally, before he returns to breed and train high-level polo horses . ‘grandma is literally the driving force of our whole family, she’s amazing. she lives at the belltrees homestead herself but brings the whole family together. 'the family breeds polo horses... the plan is to see how far i can get competing, and then come home to breed and train high-level polo horses.' alec thinks the australian countryside is incredibly beautiful and the cliche is true - there's no place like home. 'i’m lucky to have played at most clubs in the world but there aren’t many that have such a great atmosphere.

'rats burrow and live in colonies,' health commissioner mary bassett told the city council at a hearing. 'i'll sometimes imagine when i walk through a park, if i could have sort of a 'rat vision,' there are all these tunnels under there that are occupied by rats. and from there the rats fan out.' financed with $611,000 in the current city budget, inspectors will work with neighborhood associations, community boards, elected officials and building owners to plug up holes and put poison in rodent tunnels. for years, inspectors responding to complaints on the city's 311 hotline have already been searching for rats and their telltale signs: burrows, droppings, claw marks and gnawed holes. besides traps and poison, the city also has used contraceptives to curb the rats. new york's rat information portal — or, appropriately, rip — is an interactive online map that tracks health department violations, with searches by borough, address, block number and zip code. spots marked red are deemed to be rat-infested; those in yellow have passed inspection. the south bronx around yankee stadium has the dubious distinction of being the city's most rat-infested neighborhood, according to figures from 2012, the most recent available. inspectors gave a failing grade for infestation to at least 13 percent of more than 3,000 locations inspected in that area. washington heights came in at 12 percent of inspected locations, west harlem at 10 percent and the lower east side and adjacent chinatown at nearly 9 percent. rats can carry and spread diseases, bite and trigger asthma attacks. in may, a fpur-year-old boy died after ingesting rat poison in a bronx homeless shelter. it's impossible to tally the exact number of rats in new york, says the rev. joel grassi, a baptist minister and professional exterminator. 'as long as there are human beings in new york city, there will be rats, because they live off human garbage — that's their no. 1 thing,' says grassi, adding that the best way to manage the rat population is to eliminate their food supply. just because your pet runs after backyard squirrels doesn't mean it could ever catch one. when at its best, the alley pack works together - one dog will sniff out a rat and signal its whereabouts, often by barking. another leaps at the hideaway to rout the quarry, and then a third lurches to catch it as it flees. a rat that scuttles into the open might get caught in a rundown, or even a tug of war, between dogs that circle and flank it. after making a kill with a bite or a shake, the hunters trot back, rat in mouth, and allow their owners to take it from their jaws. the night's kill ends up in a trash bin. the participants say they're less about killing rats than giving dogs the experience of chasing them. the health department declined to comment on the hunts. the idea has a long history. a noted 1851 examination of working-class life in london describes rat-catchers working the city's streets with ferrets and terriers. more recently, a rat-catching dachshund got attention in seattle when its owner happened by while city councilman tom rasmussen was checking out a downtown cleanup program in 2010. rasmussen snapped a picture of the dog, rat in mouth, and posted the photo on his website. there's even an american dog breed called a rat terrier, though its origins lie on farms. rat-tracking recently became an official canine sport, called 'barn hunt.' dogs get two minutes to sniff around a hay-bale maze and indicate where they smell a rat concealed in a crush-proof, aerated tube; the dog never catches the quarry. while dog owners may see it as time-honored pursuit, rat-hunting riles animal-rights advocates. people for the ethical treatment of animals, which opposes hunting in general, expressed outrage after video of a dog snatching rats in a new york city park surfaced online two years ago. peta spokesman martin mersereau calls the alley rat quests 'a twisted blood sport masquerading as rodent control.' reynolds counters that 'there are lots of worse things that people do to rats,' noting that poisons can sicken the animals for hours. as for the dogs, they have sometimes gotten stuck in waste bins or tumbled into holes, and a recent night left two with scrapes. but reynolds says none has ever been seriously hurt or fallen ill. in one recent foray, the dogs dispatched 13 rats within about a half-hour. the dogs prowled and prodded for about 90 more minutes before the group gave up for the night. # . but not to worry, said dachshund owner trudy kawami.

'before the world cup i showed him videos of marc overmars because he reminded me of him,' said rooney. 'he has the potential to be as good as overmars. bright future: raheem sterling was england's best player during wednesday's 1-0 win against norway . similar: wayne rooney believes sterling (left) shares some of the same qualities as marc overmars (right) captain material: rooney (left) has admitted showing sterling videos of overmars before the world cup . danger man: overmars scared opposition defenders with his pace and trickery in attacking areas . 63.6% - england’s win percentage against switzerland. they have won 14 of their 22 contests, drawing five and losing just three. they are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the swiss. 1 - good news for roy hodgson — england have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home. 192 - some bad news for hodgson. in 192 minutes of football, england have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot. 3 - wayne rooney looks a good bet to score at any time. the england captain has scored in each of his three appearances against switzerland. 2 - only two players have survived from england’s last game against the swiss — joe hart and jack wilshere both started that match at wembley in 2011. 17 - england like playing in basel. they have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game. that includes an 8-1 victory in 1963. 9 - switzerland have not lost at home for nine matches. their last defeat on home soil came against romania in may 2012. andrew magee . 'raheem is a fantastic and quite an unusual player. he can play right across the front line, out wide. although he's a small lad, he's really strong. the potential he's shown is incredible. he'll be a massive player for us over the next 10 to 15 years and, unfortunately, for liverpool.' overmars had terrifying speed and a clinical instinct. sterling arguably has a greater range of weaponry, but is still only 19 and developing. he is, nevertheless, the brightest spark in hodgson's post-world cup gloom. at the st jakob-park stadium here on monday night, england will look to him for creativity. four years ago, fabio capello's england arrived at the same stadium in similar circumstances. the world cup in south africa had gone badly and this was the first test for his team away from wembley. rooney was mired in front-page scandal at the time but he responded with the opening goal in a 3-1 win, which put capello in control on the road to euro 2012. hodgson could do with the same on his return to switzerland, where he is still feted for taking them to their first world cup finals in 28 years in 1994. 'winning this game does not make a great team in 2016,' said hodgson. 'neither does losing it make us a poor team in 2016. we are not in an embryonic stage — we are carrying on — but it is an early stage. we have to make sure after these next two years we are very, very strong.' wednesday's 1-0 home win over norway was not enough in itself to settle the anxieties that emerged in brazil. it is nearly two years since england actually beat any of the teams who qualified for the world cup. pivotal moment: wayne rooney scores from the penalty spot in england's 1-0 win against norway . challenges: roy hodgson will be without daniel sturridge and potentially jordan henderson on monday . preparation: hodgson leads his players in training at st jakob-park in basle on sunday afternoon . as ever, injuries have eaten into the squad. striker daniel sturridge's withdrawal on friday was more damaging than the loss of midfield rookie jack colback or back-up keeper ben foster but at least hodgson has danny welbeck ready to step in. if jordan henderson is not fit after twisting an ankle in training on sunday night it will bring another thorny problem — not least because england have brought only 17 outfield players — and challenge hodgson's theory that the nation is producing a breed of footballer no longer bound by positions. 'very few are classic number nines, or tens or sevens or fours or sixes,' hodgson said. 'they're not stereotyped. they're capable of different things. i've seen the under-20s play twice and when you watch them you do see a way in which english football is changing. i think back to the academy at blackburn 20 years ago and the type of players coming through now are different. 'it's difficult to look at an england team at any level and find a player who is not pacey, even a centre back. in the past we had stereotypical players who got by on the quality of their play. not now.' by the same token, he likes to think the style of his team is less predictable. 'the players we have are very different to the ones we had in 2012,' the manager added. 'we were a passing team. now we're a dribbling team. we're not a long-ball team any more. we try to pass through the midfield and create openings. we're athletic and pacey and technique is getting better.' hodgson refuted the accompanying theory that a 67-year-old coach might not be best-equipped to coach such modern footballers. stepping up: danny welbeck looks set to start for the three lions after an injury to daniel sturridge . settling : sterling (left) and his team-mates get used to the pitch on which they will face switzerland . all smiles: arsenal team-mates calum chambers (left) and jack wilshere (centre) share a joke in training . england will play on a monday for only the 10th time in 45 years when they face switzerland next week. uefa have spread out the qualification matches for euro 2016 as part of their new ‘week of football’ concept, with games taking place from thursday to tuesday. that means 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per cent in 2012 qualifying. the final set of fixtures in each group — scheduled for october 2015 — will still kick off simultaneously. england have only played nine monday games since 1966, but prior to that they were a regular occurrence. between 1880 and 1927, england played wales alone 33 times on a monday. the good news for england fans is their record is good... p...55  w...37  d...11  l...7 win %...67.3 . 'either you're a good coach or you're not,' he rapped back. 'either you know how to put your approach across or not. you just try to make sure the best players are in important places, and those around them complement them. that's how it's been since i started. i don't see any difference at all now to that.' and so, to the puzzle of where precisely to deploy sterling, who was so impressive at the tip of a diamond in the final 20 minutes against norway, after rooney had been replaced. does he keep him there or move him back to the wing, albeit with freedom to float? the team practised with the diamond midfield at times last week while at st george's park and, in the absence of sturridge, england can more easily revert to 4-2-3-1 without threatening rooney's place. 'there are options,' said hodgson. 'it's up to us to perform and play well. is it enough to come here and play 10 behind the ball and sneak a 0-0? no, i'd say it isn't.'

tells cnn's piers morgan. \"if you don't do something to stop that -- that's when there's something wrong with you.\" in their first-ever joint prime time interview, actress demi moore and actor ashton kutcher will be guests on thursday's \"piers morgan tonight.\" the husband-and-wife team launched the demi & ashton foundation (dna) after a visit to the u.s.-mexico border in january. they met a girl who had been trafficked into the united states by her pimp, who brought her into a field where she was repeatedly raped on a trash bag by 30 men. the dna foundation stands for the fundamental right to freedom for every person -- because it's within our dna. \"it just seemed impossible to live in a world where that was going on and not, you know, do something about it,\" said moore. more: the cnn freedom project: ending modern-day slavery . according to kutcher, the average age of entry into the sex trade is 13. \"and that's globally, by the way,\" added the actor, who also pointed out that many americans view child sex slavery as a problem in places that they have no control over, such as cambodia, india or nepal. kutcher wants to people to realize trafficking is prevalent in the u.s., too. traffickers are often \"average joes,\" usually in their early 30s. \"and what they're really doing,\" said kutcher, \"is profiting off the sale of these women and girls.\" these men seem like perfect guys to vulnerable girls from broken homes. pimps start off nice and generous in a ritual that moore likens to \"courting.\" sometimes they meet the girls online, establish relationships with them, take them shopping, make them comfortable and gain their trust. one of the so-called faces of human trafficking joined \"piers morgan tonight\" under concealed identity from an undisclosed location to provide a first-hand account of what morgan called \"the horrors of sex trafficking.\" the 17-year-old girl went by the name \"nicole\" for the purposes of the interview. when nicole -- who is an american citizen -- was 13, her father went to jail while her mother battled drug addiction. nicole began establishing relationships with men online, leading to a cycle of pimps, drug problems and even jail. moore recalled the story of a girl who, now 18, was just 11 when she was taken in by a pimp. in a similar fashion, he took her to mcdonald's, took her to the mall and made her feel safe. pretty soon she was forced into child prostitution and given a $1,500-a-night quota. if she didn't meet her quota, she was beaten or forced to sit in a tub of ice. her pimp's nickname was \"daddy day care\" because the girls he overpowered were extremely young. according to the girl, moore said, the pimp would load the girls into an overcrowded car -- so crowded that some rode in the trunk -- drive to las vegas, place ads on craigslist and have the girls prostituting almost immediately. siddharth kara, author of \"sex trafficking, inside the business of modern slavery\" also joined the show. kara said at a minimum, there are \"1.5 million traffic sex slaves in the world today generating profits in 2010 that exceeded $39 billion.\" moore reiterated that she and kutcher initiated the campaign \"to create awareness. you have to acknowledge a problem exists before you can actually go about finding a solution,\" she said. \"and what we've found is that most people aren't even aware of what's going on.\" moore and kutcher maintain that they will remain committed to the cause no matter how long it takes to eradicate child sex slavery. morgan asked the couple famously addicted to twitter -- kutcher has 6.5 million followers, moore has 3.5 million -- if it is smart to use social media as a tool to spread the word about their campaign when social media often makes it easier for child sex traffickers to operate. \"for me,\" said kutcher, \"i think i looked at this platform and thought to myself, 'this could be the collective consciousness, right?' this platform, in and of itself, a little shout here, and a little shout there. but the key was being able to drive a link into deeper, richer content into a tweet, and then have that tweet be syndicated. \"i don't believe that there's a problem in the world that exists that the solutions didn't exist before the problem. so that's why we're using social media for this campaign,\" he said. \"it's to actually go right into the heart of where it's taking place. seventy-six percent of the transactions for child sex slavery is actually happening online. so if we can motivate people while they are online to do something about that, then we can make a dent.\" furthermore, kutcher urged people to visit sites such as craigslist and flag pages that appear to be about child trafficking. \"people can start to actually un-root this at its root,\" said kutcher, who urged people to go to facebook.com\/thednafoundation, put themselves in a video, share that video with friends and go to the action tab where the foundation outlines online initiatives. \"we want the social web to become the police for human trafficking online,\" kutcher told morgan. watch piers morgan live weeknights 9 p.m. et. for

'one of the things about being a leader in today's world as a woman is that there aren't many others… and i think because of that, when we do get the opportunity to say: \"what's it like for you?\", even across party lines… there are some common and shared experiences,' she told the diane rehm radio show. among the struggles often encountered by female leaders, said ms gillard, was the fact they are often judged on appearance, the struggle of often being the only woman in the room, and not being treated 'instinctively with the same sense of seriousness or the view that you will have the same gravitas as a male leader'. female leaders at chogm in 2011 (from left) bangladesh prime minister sheikh hasina, queen elizabeth ii, julia gillard, trinidad and tobago prime minister kamla persad-bissessar . julia gillard says female leaders are still very much the minority. she is seated next to the prime minister of thailand yingluck shinawatra and prime minister of denmark helle thorning-schmidt (right) during the 2012 nuclear security summit . she also said that there was a different approach to female and male leaders.

with gaza, it appeared to be holding, an israeli official said. \"we assumed it would take a while for the cease-fire to take hold,\" israel's ambassador to the united states, michael oren, told cnn. \"i understand now that it has taken hold. there hasn't been fire for a while and, of course, we are not firing, so there is a cease-fire.\" his remarks came after an israeli military spokeswoman, lt. col. avital leibovich, told cnn that five rockets had been fired from gaza in violation of the cease-fire. deputy foreign minister danny ayalon, in an interview with cnn, put the number of rockets at 12. wednesday's cease-fire followed eight days of violence along israel's border with gaza and nearly 150 deaths -- the vast majority of them palestinian. egypt's morsy praised for his key role in talks . the cease-fire, announced in a joint news conference in cairo with u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton and egyptian foreign minister mohamed kamel amr, took effect at 9 p.m. (2 p.m. et). gazans took to the streets, firing guns into the air in celebration of what they considered to be a victory over israel's military. the agreement calls for israel to halt all acts of aggression on gaza, including incursions and the targeting of people, according to egypt's state news agency egynews. it also calls for the palestinian factions to cease all hostilities from gaza against israel, including the firing of rockets and attacks on the border. border crossings were to be opened thursday night, and the movement of people and goods across them was to be eased, it said. on the ground: follow updates from cnn's reporters . the agreement came after a day of negotiations that included clinton, egyptian president mohamed morsy and palestinian officials. israeli government spokesman mark regev said the agreement calls for \"complete and total cessation of all hostile activity initiated in the gaza strip.\" \"for us, that's victory. that's what we wanted,\" he said. prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned of possible additional military action if the cease-fire fails to lead to long-term security. \"but at this time, the right thing for the state of israel is to exhaust this opportunity to obtain a long-term cease fire,\" he said. netanyahu thanked u.s. president barack obama for his \"unreserved support\" of israel's actions. it was the november 14 assassination by israeli forces of ahmed al-ja'abari, the head of hamas' military wing, that ignited the fighting. opinion: will real change come from this cease-fire? israel launched its offensive with a stated goal of ending the rocket attacks on southern israel from inside gaza by degrading the ability of palestinians to launch such attacks. \"their attempts backfired against them,\" said khaled meshaal, a hamas political leader. \"they wanted to destroy the infrastructure of the resistance of hamas. they claim they have done so, and they have not. they are bankrupt.\" he cited israel's destruction of buildings and killings that included civilians. \"this is their accomplishment,\" he said. \"they have nothing else to show. and our rockets continued to strike them until the last minute.\" israel will hold hamas responsible for any attacks from gaza, whether conducted by that organization or any others, regev said. he said the agreement reflects that understanding. ireport: share your stories from the region . as he was preparing to return to new york from tel aviv, u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon said late wednesday his biggest concern was for the safety of civilians, \"no matter where they are. innocent people, including children, have been killed or injured on both sides. families on both sides were forced to cower in fear as the violence raged around them.\" he said that more than 139 palestinians had been killed, more than 70 of them civilians, and more than 900 were injured. in addition, some 10,000 palestinians had lost their homes, he said, adding there was a critical need for humanitarian aid in the territory. idf's leibovich dismissed such concerns. \"there is no crisis in gaza,\" she told cnn, adding that she had seen pictures wednesday morning of markets filled with fresh produce. \"i understand that some things are not convenient,\" she said. during the conflict, rocket fire killed four israeli civilians and wounded 219 other people, most of them civilians, three of them seriously, ban said. in addition, an israeli soldier was killed and 16 were wounded, one critically, he said. smuggling weapons to gaza -- the long way . in all, 1,456 rockets were estimated to have been fired from gaza into israel, with three long-range missiles hitting the outskirts of jerusalem, a move he called \"unprecedented.\" israeli forces reported strikes on more than 1,450 targets in gaza, ban said. they targeted, but were not limited to, attacks on rocket-launching sites, military bases, police stations and tunnels along the border with egypt, he said. hundreds of other buildings were hit, ban said, adding that he condemned \"indiscriminate rocket fire from gaza into israel,\" but also believed that the \"excessive and disproportionate use of force that endangers civilian lives is intolerable.\" long-term solutions for gaza and the palestinians in general must be found, he said. \"once calm is fully restored and the violence ends, a broader cease-fire will have to address all the underlying causes of conflict, including the full opening of crossings, palestinian reconciliation and an end to weapons smuggling.\" how middle east has changed since last gaza conflict . regev said the deal calls for talks to begin thursday on easing economic restrictions on gaza. \"if the border is quiet, that enables us to be more forthcoming,\" he said. clinton, who shuttled among israel, the west bank and egypt to help negotiate the deal, said the united states will continue to work with regional partners to implement and expand the agreement. obama spoke wednesday morning with morsy, thanking the egyptian leader for his leadership in negotiating the proposal. as recently as wednesday afternoon, hamas officials had been calling for more strikes against israel, while that country's military continued to press its campaign against what it said were suspected rocket-launching sites and \"terrorist hideouts.\" arab-americans watch conflict with mix of worry, relief . the cease-fire talks, held in the west bank, israel and cairo, continued despite a lunchtime bus attack near the defense ministry headquarters in tel aviv. at least two bombs were planted on the bus, israeli police spokesman micky rosenfeld said. one of the bombs exploded, blowing out the windows of the bus, he said. rosenfeld said 24 people were wounded, three of them seriously. aviva shemer with ichilov hospital said pedestrians were among the injured. belief blog: how u.s. jews view the situation . police said they were seeking at least one and possibly two suspects. hamas put its own spin on the attack in a banner on al-aqsa, calling it \"a natural response to the massacre of the al-dalou family and targeting of innocent palestinian civilians.\" nine members of the al-dalou family died sunday in an israeli airstrike, provoking outrage among palestinians. \"we told you #idf that our blessed hands will reach your leaders and soldiers wherever they are,\" the al qassam brigades, the military wing of hamas, said on twitter. \"you opened the gates of hell on yourselves.\" diplomats said they were hoping to avoid a repeat of 2008 and 2009, when at least 1,400 people died as israeli troops invaded gaza after similar rocket attacks. analysis: conflict shifts balance of power in the middle east . cnn's tom watkins, ben

it took yaya sanogo. well, 18 months, 19 appearances and 73 seconds, but when his first arsenal goal finally arrived, it was wonderfully timed. it was a strike to puncture the pressure and soothe the nerves. sanogo was engulfed by supporters and team-mates, while arsene wenger punched the air. a striker who had forgotten the way to goal had found the net at a most crucial moment, before the result was put beyond doubt by alexis sanchez, a striker who seemingly cannot miss. alexis sanchez runs towards the arsenal fans in celebration of his second-half strike against borussia dortmund . the chile

rubbish the claim players need time to adjust in england. where would arsenal be without him? wenger may choose not to dwell on that. what was important for the manager was victory after three games without a win, which triggered familiar complaints about his strategy from some quarters. for the 15th consecutive year, he leads his team into the knockout stages of the champions league and wenger is fiercely proud of this record. there is even an outside chance of topping the group. there was a clean sheet and an encouraging performance from rookie keeper damian martinez but it was not all positive news. sanogo pulled a hamstring towards the end of the game and captain mikel arteta limped off with a calf injury which wenger admitted ‘looks quite serious’. injuries have compounded inconsistent form and the squad is stretched to its limits as it enters the busy festive schedule. at least wenger knows his decision to start with sanogo was justified. the 21-year-old was included ahead of lukas podolski on account of his ability to hold up the ball and bring others into the game, which he did instantly. the game had barely kicked off when calum chambers threw him the ball to fight for with his back to goal, near the edge of the dortmund penalty area. he held off the challenge of matthias ginter and flicked a pass to santi cazorla, who slipped the ball back to him. in front of goal, sanogo made no mistake. he looked offside but the flag stayed down. the emirates stadium sighed with relief and sang: ‘he scores when he wants!’ alex oxlade-chamberlain and sanchez zipped around on the flanks pulling yellow shirts out of line and allowed aaron ramsey to slide sanogo clear again. with a little more time to think, his actions were far less clinical and ginter had time to recover and make a block. jurgen klopp’s team, too fast and furious for arsenal in dortmund in the opening game of this campaign, were simply not the same. sanchez curls his 57th minute strike between two dortmund defenders to double his side's lead . dortmund's goalkeeper roman weidenfeller (right) dives at full stretch but fails to reach the striker from sanchez . yaya sanogo (right)

they, too, have seen confidence eaten away by injuries and languish third from bottom in the bundesliga, a fact overlooked by those who have decided klopp should replace wenger. dortmund made a sluggish start. it was midway through the first half before they got any toe-hold in the game and began to test arsenal’s fragile defence. even then it was not a severe test and klopp cut an agitated figure on the touchline. for a spell either side of the interval, ilkay gundogan enjoyed good possession in midfield and dictated the tempo, often searching to hit lukasz piszczek on the overlap. ciro immobile was close to connecting with a cross before henrikh mkhitaryan collected a nod-down from piszczek and forced a splendid save from martinez. like sanogo, the keeper had stepped forward when it was required. martinez thwarted mkhitaryan again and made late saves, including a terrific one with his right boot from substitute adrian ramos. the arsenal players celebrates the french youngster's

adventure after the break but this only helped arsenal, offering more freedom to oxlade-chamberlain, cazorla and sanchez as they sprang on the counter-attack. roman weidenfeller made a fine save with his left hand to keep out a drive by sanchez which fizzed across the slick surface, but was stranded by a lob from the ox moments later. weidenfeller turned, expecting to see the ball drop into his goal, but it struck woodwork and bounced clear. oxlade- chamberlain held his head. the disappointment did not last. sanchez took a pass from cazorla in the inside-left area, ducked on to his right foot and curled a shot beyond the diving dortmund keeper into the far corner. klopp made changes in a bid to shake a reaction from his team, but they had qualified already and this can play subconsciously. arsenal have a glimmer of a chance to win the group, but they need to beat galatasaray and hope anderlecht win in dortmund. until then, wenger will bank the win and move on to west

legislation in the country, other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state's footsteps or stand back. arizona's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the united states illegally. it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them. critics, including immigrant advocates and the american civil liberties union of arizona, are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status. the bill made it through the state senate on monday after it was passed by the state house last week. it's now awaiting the signature of republican gov. jan brewer. supporters of the measure expect her to sign it. latino members of congress are calling on brewer to veto it. michael hethmon, general counsel for the immigration reform law institute, helped draft the language of the arizona bill. the institute is the legal affiliate of the federation for american immigration reform. on the heels of the arizona initiative, hethmon said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. he declined to identify the states, citing attorney-client privilege. \"arizona was meant to be the leading edge,\" hethmon said. \"if you are going to work on developing a state-based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- arizona is the place to do it.\" hethmon pointed to arizona's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform, noting that \"what's happening in arizona just didn't pop out of nowhere. it's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process.\" republican state rep. russell pearce, who sponsored the legislation in arizona, said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent. state laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to numbers from the national conference of state legislatures. in 2005, 300 bills were introduced. the next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009. about 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education. about1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year. hethmon cited the election year, the democratic leadership's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation. \"historically, not only in the u.s. but in virtually all industrialized nations, when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players,\" he said. whether arizona becomes the standard-bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation, said ann morse, the program director of the national conference of state legislatures' immigrant policy project. \"certainly states will look at it, but not in a rush,\" she said. with court challenges promised from opponents, states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it's costly, morse said. omar jadwat, the staff attorney with the aclu's immigrants rights' project, said following in arizona's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction. \"although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path, i think it's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter, that arizona's approach is the wrong one,\" he said. isabel garcia, a legal defender in arizona's pima county, blasted the bill as \"the most dangerous precedent in this country, violating all of our due process rights.\" \"we have not seen this kind of legislation since the jim crow laws. and targeting our communities, it is the single most largest attack on our communities,\" she said. pearce brushed off her criticism, saying, \" 'illegal' is not a race, it's a crime.\" \"we do not tolerate those who break into our country, just like we don't tolerate those who break into our homes,\" he said. hethmon praised the legislation as \"the most cost-effective and the most humane way to deal with the illegal immigration problem.\" \"every time you convince an illegal alien to self-deport, you bypass having to resort to direct physical deportation,\" he said. in addition to providing a model for other states, hethmon said the legislation in arizona and other bills in the works in other states also provide an example on the national level. \"the states are laboratories for democracy. the federal government is in gridlock,\" he said. \"we're providing models for the day when the ice breaks up on the hill and the legislative waters flow and the country decides to confront this problem in a realistic way.\"

bustling capital barely above sea level and facing inundation at the next high tide predicted at 13 feet. residents who decided to stay in their homes despite government pleas to get out waited anxiously to see whether high tide, forecast for saturday afternoon, would overwhelm defenses along the chao phraya river and its many canals. bangkok's outer suburbs were already submerged, but the central city had been largely spared the misery thailand has been suffering for months in the nation's worst flooding since 1942. in the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods, but in central bangkok, it had been mostly dry. the city was facing two converging threats, however. runoff the equivalent of 480,000 olympic-size pools was flowing south to the sea through bangkok, as high tide pushed the water in the opposite direction. \"the challenge is to manage the huge runoff from the north passing via the city on its way to the gulf of thailand,\" a red cross bulletin said. saturday's high tide, the red cross said, was expected to put \"extreme pressure\" on bangkok's elaborate system of dikes and other flood defenses. prime minister yingluck shinawatra ordered work crews friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage, according to the state-run mcot news agency. but the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps, the bangkok post reported. health concerns were rising with the water. bangkok residents waded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials. the government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater. \"we were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters and every day we see children playing in the water, bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground,\" said annie bodmer-roy, spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency save the children. as floodwater entered homes, some bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave. thanyarat hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city. \"some families in southern bangkok had their house flooded,\" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded. \"the water level is 2 meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,\" she said. the military had set up a flood relief center, \"but now even that has water coming in it,\" she said. asked what help the government had provided, she said, \"we don't see that the government is doing anything much to help people, so better to help ourselves by getting out of bangkok.\" but the bangkok post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on saturday and take them out of bangkok. as of saturday, an estimated 1 million of the city's 12 million residents had left. another bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave. still, so many people had left that the streets were relatively quiet. panic buying had led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital, residents said. city officials bracing for more flooding have opened nine evacuation centers. officials urged tourists to steer clear of bangkok, while noting that many of the other tourist spots, such as phuket, remained dry and open for business. thailand's ministry of public health had transferred 280 of the capital's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry, the mcot news agency reported. the remaining 240 patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces by sunday, it said, citing permanent-secretary for health paichit varachit. health minister witthaya buranasiri said that, after months of flooding, 107,101 thais have been diagnosed with stress, 6,214 with depression and 878 at risk of suicide. in all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to mcot. the u.s. state department issued a travel alert on thursday, recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. it noted that most tourist destinations, such as phuket and chiang mai, were unaffected. u.s. ambassador kristie kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next. the united states has already provided civilian relief resources, including water pumps, water purifiers and life vests, she said, and two u.s. helicopters are helping the thai military determine the extent of the flooding. the floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, . are you there? share photos, video but stay safe . the government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas. the government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and

swim across the english channel to raise money for veterans on the 65th anniversary of d-day. a group of american students rest and warm up in between turns swimming in the english channel. they didn't make it to the shores of france, but the physical and psychological anguish was enough to remind them of the soldiers their journey was meant to commemorate. \"i recognize that i have not done anything. even an attempt to swim the channel -- and a failed attempt at that -- is incomparable to the sacrifices people make on a day-to-day basis for our country,\" said daniel decker, a graduate of the u.s. naval academy who is studying at oxford university on a marshall scholarship from the navy. \"at the same time, i'm happy we were able to raise some money to go toward veterans and raise awareness of the sacrifices they're making,\" he said. \"that's the best blessing i get from this -- not necessarily success for the hardship of our ordeal but the awareness raised, some recognition put toward people who really deserve it.\" decker, 22, is one of five reluctant heroes who left dover, england, around 10 p.m. friday, and set out over the channel's choppy waters, accompanied by friends, the captain of the suva and a representative from the channel swimming association. collectively, they swam about 23 miles in speedos and swim caps, slathered in petroleum jelly, against strong currents in waters that neared 55 degrees fahrenheit. swells reaching 6-7 feet steered them off course and knocked them against the boat at times before forcing them to turn around about 1.5 miles from their destination. \"i would have much rather touched french soil but, at the end of the day, we swam the english channel,\" said eric gardiner, one of two people aboard the ship who managed to avoid vomiting. \"i felt like an ant in a toilet bowl. it was kind of humbling.\" yet the group, which consists of two rhodes scholars and three naval academy graduates who will enter seal training after school, considers the mission a success, in terms of honoring veterans of the past and present. they raised $5,000 for the mission continues, a missouri-based nonprofit that helps wounded and disabled veterans serving their communities after they return to the united states. \"we, as a group, wanted to do this to honor the inspirational veterans of the greatest generation of the past. most of us had grandpas that fought in world war ii and as a result, this historical anniversary had a special significance to all of us,\" said scott erwin, a rhodes scholar and former department of defense employee who was injured in iraq. \"we also wanted to do something to recognize today's inspirational veterans. we chose mission continues because all of us believe in its mission of attempting to allow veterans injured in combat operations to continue to serve causes great than themselves when they return to us,\" he said. the mission continues provides wounded and disabled veterans with paid fellowships while they pursue service and leadership roles in the community, said co-founder eric greitens, a navy seal officer who used his combat pay to help start the organization. \"there are a lot of programs for wounded and disabled veterans designed to give them many things they need, like free backpacking trips, rental cars, access to heath care facilities,\" he said. \"but no one was giving them a challenge or an opportunity to continue their service to the country even though their wounds had cut short their military service.\" erwin and greitens, also a former rhodes scholar, met after erwin returned from iraq. through erwin's experiences recovering at the walter reed army medical center, he became involved in the mission continues, helping to raise funds after he went to oxford. erwin initiated the idea of the channel swim as a fundraiser about six months ago and recruited decker, gardiner, shipley and u.s. naval academy graduate joseph hess to the cause. they trained in coastal beaches throughout the winter, but nothing could have prepared them for the experience of a midnight swim in the english channel. \"i went in at 1 a.m. and it was completely black. you can't see anything other than the headlight of the boat and everywhere you look is complete blackness,\" said drew shipley, 25, another rhodes scholar who is working on his ph.d. in political sociology. \"we trained well but there's no way to train for those water temperatures, plus the sensory overload of being in the middle of the english channel in the middle of the night surrounded by darkness.\" the five swimmers took hourlong turns in the water, using the intervals on the ship to return to normal body temperature before they prepared to return the open sea. after his third time out, one of the swimmers returned with the look of a \"wild animal\" in his eye, according to his teammates, and fell into violent shakes. \"we got every layer of clothing we could on him, and we had to give him bear hugs to give him some body heat,\" said gardiner, another graduate of the naval academy, who is studying at queens university in belfast, ireland, on a navy marshall scholarship. \"he really left it all out there in the water. it was inspiring because he took it to that level.\" gardiner, 22, said it has been a dream of his to swim the channel ever since he visited the beaches of normandy in high school -- the same trip that inspired him to join the armed forces. \"it wasn't necessarily about glory, it was about d-day and charity and doing it as a team,\" he said. \"compared to what those who invaded on d-day had to encounter when they made it to the other side, this was chump change.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":", The article is

tag of \"14-time major winner\" and close on jack nicklaus's all-time record of 18. woods has been stuck on 14 since winning the u.s. open in june 2008 with an injured knee which required surgery and a lengthy recuperation. his well-chronicled personal problems also clearly impacted on his career and it was only last year which saw the re-emergence of a golfer resembling the former all-conquering tiger. five wins on the pga tour were ample evidence, but in the majors his best was tied fourth at the masters and he will be focused on changing that stat. with youngsters like spieth emerging and veterans like arch-rival phil mickelson showing no signs of fading away, woods, who has just turned 38, knows this is a big year -- and the choice of venues for the majors could be in his favor. \"i'm really excited about the major championships next year. i've won at three of the four venues -- augusta national, valhalla golf club and royal liverpool -- and on pinehurst no. 2 (u.s. open), i'm trending the right way, having finished third and second,\" he told his own website. woods skipped the opening tournament of the year in hawaii to spend time with his girlfriend lindsey vonn -- who will miss the 2014 winter olympics in sochi due to her own knee problem -- before beginning his own buildup to the masters in april. he still holds the record low total at augusta of 270 back in 1997 when he announced himself to the wider sporting public with a stunning victory. rory mcilroy . mcilroy started 2013 as the world's top-ranked golfer and ended it as the sixth best after a series of on and off-course problems. with a new management team and a new fiancee -- he announced his engagement to danish tennis star caroline wozniacki on new year's eve on twitter -- the popular 24-year-old from northern ireland can enter 2014 with optimism. buoyed by an end-of-year victory at the australian open, mcilroy has renewed confidence in himself and his nike equipment after a big-money switch to the sportswear manufacturer at the start of 2012 that some linked to his poor form on the course. \"i'm confident with my game and confident where it's going,\" mcilroy told reporters. \"i won a major in 2011 and 2012 but not in 2013, so i'll try to make up for that with two this year.\" a bold prediction, but mcilroy clearly has the talent to back up his words and has been practicing hard in dubai ahead of his opening tournament of the season at the abu dhabi championship starting on january 16. he will lock horns with woods for the first time in 2014 at the dubai desert classic a fortnight later -- an early marker for the rest of the year. adam scott . scott was denied the \"triple crown\" back in his home country in december by mcilroy, who mounted a final round charge to win at royal sydney. following wins at the australian pga and masters events, it would have capped a triumphant 2013 for the 33-year-old from adelaide, who won his first major at augusta. scott also paired with jason day to win the world cup for australia and, combined with an impressive victory at the barclays, the first event of the pga tour's fedex cup playoffs, it left him second in the world rankings behind woods at year's end. many believe scott will reach top spot in 2014 and add to his majors haul, having shrugged off the disappointment of letting a four-shot lead slip to hand ernie els the 2012 british open crown. a dramatic playoff win over angel cabrera of argentina at augusta sealed his place in golfing history and he was also in contention at the british open and u.s. pga championships. scott performed strongly at kapalua in the tournament of champions, tying for sixth, to serve notice he will again be a force in 2014. lee chang-woo . both the pga tour, and in particular the women's lpga tour, are becoming accustomed to precocious teenagers from asia turning up in the united states and making their mark. last year it was china's 14-year-old guan tianglang who had greats like gary player singing his praises with his performances at augusta -- where he made the cut -- and subsequent pga tour events. in 2014, south korean lee chang-woo has the same opportunity after emulating guan and winning the asia-pacific amateur championship. that booked a place for the 19-year-year-old at the masters and also a spot at final qualifying for the british open. he is likely to grab the opportunities with both hands, having already mixed it with established professionals while still in the unpaid ranks. seoul-born lee tied for second with mcilroy at the korea open, the week before his asia-pacific win, and claimed victory in an earlier korean tour event. \"playing in the masters has been my dream since i started playing golf,\" he said. \"this is a great honor, i have never been so excited.\" guan could not repeat his heroics of 2012 and finished back in eighth, but lee was initially challenged in the final round by another young chinese star, dou zecheng, before the 16-year-old fell away on the back nine. the pedigree of the asia-pacific amateur winners is also strong. since 2009, all but one winner has made the cut at the masters. japan's hideki matsuyama, a previous qualifier by this route, achieved the feat twice and finished third in the frys.com open last october, the opening event on the 2013-14 pga tour calendar. lee will be hoping to make a similar impression to earn sponsor invites for pga events after the masters, while matsuyama has already proved he can mix it with the best while still in the amateur ranks.

'food has become more than just a hobby, so i spend most weekends cooking and coming up with recipes. 'it has become a passion to me and i am on an incredible journey.' he said he had even started exercising due to the amount of food he is now cooking and eating. 'i've had to start going to the gym because i'll end up putting on weight because of cooking from home,' he said. mr lewis used to rely on takeaways but was inspired to learn to cook after watching jamie oliver poach an egg during a christmas special. his first video 'poached egg on toast' was posted on youtube in january 2010 and was soon followed by 'ratatouille'. since then he has posted more than 700 videos which have attracted 9.6 million views and he now has his own website www.myvirginkitchen.com. many of the videos feature him cooking with daughter phoebe in the kitchen of the family's  £150,000 home in weston-super-mare, and they often wear fancy dress as they lark around in front of the camera. mr lewis didn't even know how to poach an egg five years ago, but has now taught himself a host of recipes . he has attracted nearly 10million views and 150,000 subscribers with his regular cookery videos on youtube . mr lewis used to rely on takeaways but was inspired to learn to cook after watching jamie oliver poach an egg during a christmas special. he now features on the supermarket's 'love your freezer' campaign (above) his other daughter chloe, two, has also appeared, although his camera-shy partner rebecca has never voluntarily featured in the videos. he said: 'sometimes i get a bit of help from phoebe as she likes to join in.

'there are no food stylists, and instead of a live audience of about 100 people, as there was for the launch of food tube, it's usually just me on my own.' mr lewis now wants to inspire other 'kitchen virgins' to try out new recipes. 'i want to inspire other people to cook instead of feeling intimidated about giving it a try,' he said. 'my philosophy is that if i can do it, then anyone can. 'everything you see me cook i am cooking for the first time - it is all about trying to inspire people who have never cooked to give it a go. 'i have done more than 700 videos to date, mainly recipes ranging from simple one-pot dishes, quick dinner ideas to cooking with kids or naughty desserts. 'i like to have fun, too, and often taste things people have been sending me or try and overcome food fears. basically, anything goes.'

'there is the spirit of the law, why are they making a personal profit from allowances which they receive from the taxpayer? in this case they very clearly are.' mr jackson said: 'all british citizens are entitled . to seek legal adjudication if the state’s actions are unfair or possibly . illegal and so i will be forcefully resisting their precipitous . litigation.' martin bell, a former mp, said mps should repay any profit they made on their properties . he disputes ipsa's assessment that the family home in his constituency rose in value by 20 per cent from 2010 to 2012, claiming house prices in the area actually fell by three per cent. 'at . my own expense, i have paid for an accurate recent expert valuation and . i have made a reasonable offer to ipsa to settle the matter and reduce . the legal costs which will have to be met by the taxpayer. 'my . valuation recognises the need for proper recompense to be paid to the . taxpayer to reflect their support for my housing costs between 2010 and . 2012, in order to fulfill my duties as both a london based legislator . and a constituency mp.

'the . final stage in bringing this to an end was our allowing a short . transition period for mps who were already committed to second . mortgages.

driving or flying can now be cheaper than catching the train - even for solo journeys . that is more than eight times the cost of an open return national express coach journey at £39.50 and enough to pay for a family of four flying on ryanair to barcelona (£184) or athens (£240). it would also pay for a flight to rome on norwegian air (£240), or a single traveller flying to new york for £334 with kuwait airways. the fare findings follow a damning report this week by rail watchdogs showing that rail travellers have registered the lowest level of satisfaction with the railways in five years. they were annoyed by overcrowded, expensive and late-running services. in january fares rose across all types of tickets by an average of 2.2 per cent. but season tickets went up by 2.5 per cent – not only well above the consumer prices index (cpi) inflation figure but also in excess of most annual pay rises. customer dissatisfaction has been compounded by anger over ‘fat cat bonuses’ awarded to rail chiefs, which have been branded ‘rewards for failure’. expensive: the comparison was carried out 20 years after the privatisation of the railways in britain . return tickets pre-booked . £41   barcelona . £53   athens . £62   rome . £94   marrakech . £95   dubrovnik . £150  st petersburg . £282  dubai . £334  new york . source: skyscanner . barry doe, an independent fares expert, was commissioned to carry out research on rising ticket prices by the transport salaried staffs association (tssa) union. his research shows that an open return rail ticket between london and bristol has soared by 246 per cent – from £57 to £197. the anytime fare from the capital to liverpool has jumped by 232 per cent from £93 to £309, while to cardiff it has increased by 211 per cent from £70 to £218. this makes cars a cost-effective alternative to rail travel – especially for families. aa president edmund king said: ‘for the cost of my annual rail season ticket – a painful £4,028 – i could buy a second-hand car for £1000, tax and insure it and still have enough to pay for 20,000 miles of petrol, which is two years’ motoring for the average driver.’ a spokesman for virgin trains defended the £329 return anytime fare from london to manchester, noting that a fraction of travellers paid it and most chose from a range of cheaper flexible options. they added: ‘over the last year the number of passengers travelling on the standard anytime fare of £164.50 one way and £329 return represented only 3.7 per cent of the journeys made between london and manchester. an open return to edinburgh even with nationalised east coast costs £313 - up from £130 two decades ago . many of our advanced fares from manchester remained the same or came down in january – overall our fares increased by 1.4 per cent which is significantly below the industry average.’ a spokesman for the rail delivery group, which represents network rail and train operators, said: ‘the tssa’s figures are misleading in the extreme as they deliberately focus only on the most expensive fares. on average, the cost of rail travel has increased by 6 per cent in real terms over the last 15 years. ‘this helps explain why passenger numbers have almost doubled over the period, contributing to a fivefold increase in money going back to reinvest in a better railway.’ but labour’s transport spokesman michael dugher said: ‘rail passengers are being let down and ripped off. things have got worse on our railways.’ and tssa general secretary manuel cortes said: ‘passengers have paid a terrible price for this political folly. the private rail industry has taken all the gain while passengers have suffered all the pain. passengers have paid a small fortune on fares while rail bosses are paid a fortune. ‘we want to end this persecution of passengers which started after privatisation.’ he added: ‘it is hardly surprising that satisfaction is falling when commuters are paying record fares for a worsening service. it is an absolute disgrace.’ [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":".]  The article discusses the significant increase in rail fares in the UK over the past 20 years, with some open return tickets costing more than the price of taking a family on a flight to the Mediterranean or New York.

You get straight to the point.\n<<\/SYS>>\n\nWhat are the important parts of this article?: (cnn) -- the crowd of farmers in the nile delta's sharqiya province cheered loudly whenever the neatly groomed candidate came out with a new promise. jobs! schools! better social services! a better future! he smiled broadly as the cheering swelled, wiping the sweat off his brow with a white handkerchief. he wore a freshly pressed white shirt with an open collar, under a well-cut blue blazer. he was the picture of authority and self-confidence. afterward, one of the farmers brushed off the other contenders in the presidential election as posers. \"there is no one else,\" he told me. \"the other candidates don't care about egypt. they've been hired!\" his candidate, hosni mubarak, easily won the election, back in september 2005, though there is little doubt it was rigged in his favor. it was another \"historic\" election, the first multi-candidate presidential election ever, though the challengers never had a chance against an incumbent backed by the vast resources and lack of scruples of the egyptian state. today, mubarak is under armed guard albeit in a luxury wing of a cairo hospital, awaiting the verdict from his trial in early june. much has changed since the last presidential election, but much remains the same. mubarak came from the military, and the military, in the form of the supreme council of the armed forces (scaf), still runs the country. while scaf has tried to talk the talk of the new era, all of its members rose through the ranks of the egyptian military with the blessings of hosni mubarak. according to the u.s. state department cables posted on the internet by wikileaks, midlevel egyptian army officers referred to field marshall mohamed hussein tantawi, the head of scaf, as \"mubarak's poodle.\" scaf has overseen the process that led to this presidential election, in which egyptians had the opportunity to choose their president from among 13 candidates on the ballot (although two pulled out of the race). since mubarak stepped down on february 11, 2011, scaf has stumbled from one crisis to another, reacting with violence and brutality against protesters, but often ceding ground when tahrir square filled and passions boiled. scaf has pledged to hand over executive power to a civilian president by the end of june. in theory, egypt is on the cusp of monumental change. these are heady days in egypt. everyone seems to be pontificating on politics, comparing candidates, pondering platforms. the election is everywhere. the airwaves are full of it, facebook and twitter are abuzz with it, the streets are festooned with posters and banners. on the surface it seems so different from the predictable, managed, officially sanctioned politics of the mubarak years. but the choice facing egyptians is, actually, little changed. under the old regime, hosni mubarak made it clear he was the champion of the status quo, holding back the islamist tide, led by the then-banned but tolerated muslim brotherhood. in this election, voters can choose the status quo -- with some lip service to post-revolutionary reality -- in the form of former foreign minister and later arab league secretary general amre moussa or ex-civil aviation minister and briefly prime minister ahmed shafik. or they can opt for a new islamic order, either with the full-on muslim brotherhood candidate, u.s.-educated mohamed morsi, or the islamic-lite candidate abdelmonen abol fotoh. add to the mix hamdeen sabahy, a nasserist who appeals to the leftists and the nationalists. in recent days sabahy's numbers have been rising, perhaps as a backlash against the paucity of choices among the front-runners. the establishment -- the bureaucracy, the military, the intelligence services and the business community -- clearly doesn't want to see the islamists come to power. tuesday, the semi-official cairo daily, al-akhbar, ran an ominous page-three story with the headline: \"beware of a military coup: the future will be frightening if the brotherhood reaches the summit of power.\" the source of this disturbing headline was none other than former vice president and veteran intelligence chief omar suleiman, quoted in the london pan-arab daily al-hayat. he painted a grim picture of the brotherhood setting up a revolutionary guard, along the lines of iran, to fight against the egyptian military. the military, he warned, does not know how cunning the brotherhood can be. another cairo daily ran banner headlines warning that if either of the islamist candidates wins it would be \"apocalypse now\" -- a mosaic plague of catastrophic proportions will descend upon egypt, with a breakdown in security, violence, kidnapping, thuggery and theft, massive capital flight, political isolation, unemployment, poverty, and illness. on top of all that, once the islamists have power, the paper predicted, they will murder all their political opponents. those who are opposed to the brotherhood tend to see them as forked-tongue taliban in ties, eager to impose islamic law, force women to cover up, and ban alcohol. but for egyptians struggling with rising prices and low wages, the brotherhood offers the promise of a better future. indeed, the view is not so grim among those who have received only the crumbs off the status quo's table. gamal, a bank clerk living in the old cairo district of sayida zaynab, will be voting for mohamed morsi of the brotherhood. \"the health system is in bad shape, as is education,\" he says. \"conditions for people in egypt are very, very bad.\" in the nile city of beni suef, farmer ashour darwish attended a crowded muslim brotherhood rally, eager to hear morsi speak. he supports the brotherhood, he told me, because they are champions of what matters to him: \"justice, transparency, implementation of islamic law, the plight of the poor farmers, and unemployment.\" the brotherhood's political wing, the freedom and justice party, won more than 40% of the seats in egypt's lower house of parliament in recent elections. after being hounded by the police and intelligence agencies for decades, they are finally free to operate, and aren't shy about flexing their muscles. jihad haddad, a young brotherhood member, sees no reason why the group should be shy about its power. \"we came by the vote of the people and by the choice of the people,\" he says. \"what we really want is application of real reform policies on the ground, and we can't have that opportunity if we are out of executive power.\" it would be rash at this point to make any predictions of who will actually win that executive power. the muslim brotherhood is a formidable organization that can mobilize its supporters and ensure a high turnout. they did it for the parliamentary elections and they'll doubtless be able to do it this time as well. but the prospect of both the legislative and executive branches dominated by the brotherhood worries many. magdi zaki works in the finance ministry, and voted for the brotherhood. but he feels they are novices in power, grandstanding on live broadcasts from the parliament, but doing little else. \"they have no political background,\" he says dismissive contempt, like a seasoned theatre critic dismissing a flop. polls of potential voters have been all over the place, but they do show that a majority of egyptians have yet to make up their minds. they debate the choices in taxis and buses, in the subway, in cafes, over breakfast, lunch and dinner, over twitter and on facebook, changing their minds between meals. one seasoned veteran of egyptian politicsâ€”who requested anonymityâ€”chuckled over the fickle nature of the voters, and puts it this way: \"this is the first time i've ever had people ask me, 'who do you think is going to win the presidential election?' i honestly have no idea.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":"Љ The article discusses the

(babycastles launched as a party alongside the blip festival, a showcase of chiptune musicians; this year's festival begins this week in new york.) meanwhile, the patrons of both of these independent communities are in one way or another striving to experience something new -- something that can't be bought in a store, but that is available for anyone to see and hear if they look in the right places. just like indie music, the independent gaming scene is trading in neat, mass-produced convenience for a rough-hewn, playful provocation. \"[at big gaming studios] games have become massive undertakings in which each developer acts like a cog. the budget for games has increased by billions of dollars, and developers don't take as much risk anymore,\" says salahuddin. \"so you see a lot of rehashed games from the same video game engine, like another \"unreal\" clone.\" the independent gaming movement \"is in response to that.\" the implications of babycastles remixing go wider than the music, art and gaming worlds. the hope, says salahuddin, is to build a kind of economy for independent gaming developers outside the large studios, something akin to what supports indie musicians who make much of their money through touring and merchandise. babycastles' other mission is to bring an obscured world of hobbyist game development to a larger audience -- a public that may be jaded with a culture often built on testosterone-fueled first-person shooters, or that tends to roll its eyes at the premise of games altogether. it's a formidable challenge, but, as the gallery's raucous and diverse gatherings prove, one that isn't so hard to beat. still, mixing games with the underground music scene can have its downside too -- some musicians who come to play fall in love with the games in the basement, salahuddin says. \"so bands started missing their sets.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":".

'i've thought about killing myself many times,' won said in a recent interview at her small apartment in gunpo, just south of seoul. she has two big strikes against her. there are allegations that she was merely a low-level informant whose deeds were inflated by south korean officials eager to make pyongyang look bad, and by reporters digging for a sexy story. additionally, the sexual nature of her crimes carries a stigma in this conservative country. the sexual nature of won jeong-hwa's crimes carries a stigma in conservative south korea . won was imprisoned in 2008 after a court ruled that she posed as an ordinary north korean defector, then used sex to extract secrets from south korean military officers. the media began calling her 'north korea's mata hari' in reference to an exotic dancer from the netherlands who used sex to obtain military secrets during world war i. north korea accused south korea of cooking up a spy scandal to tarnish pyongyang's image and said won was a criminal. after won was released, she was a popular guest on tv talk shows where she spoke about her harsh, elite spy training. she said she disobeyed pyongyang's orders to assassinate two south korean army intelligence officers with poison. she also talked about how she fell in love with a junior army officer - the \"man of my life.\" he was later imprisoned for passing her secrets including a list of north korean defectors even after learning she was a spy. the attention caused south korean media to revisit her case. some reporters questioned the value of her espionage work, and raised suspicions based on testimony by north korean defectors who said they knew won and her family members in the north. won's 2008 court verdict said she was trained at a special operations unit in pyongyang and was a daughter of an agent killed on a spy mission in south korea in 1974. but won's stepfather, kim dong-soon, who came to south korea in 2007, said in an interview that won's biological father was an ordinary laborer who died of a heart attack, and that won was a high school dropout who had nothing to do with special operations forces. won denies kim's allegations. in the verdict and in interviews, it was said that north korea first sent won to south korea in 2001 to take photos of the exteriors of u.s. military installations and to collect south korean newspaper editorials about north korea. people dubious of won's elite status consider that low-level spy work. some defectors who met won before her 2008 arrest say she was often incoherent and unprofessional and could not have been a highly trained spy. 'i believe that she was exploited as an informant. ... she wasn't even worth being called a spy,' said kim yong-hwa, a defector-turned-activist. he said he once rejected won's request to meet with a high-profile north korean defector because she rambled too much. a key debunker of won's espionage record is won herself. she has said in media interviews that she was pressured by prosecutors to provide false testimony, particularly about her use of sex in spy work. 98128 . 67710 . 92346 . 56262 . 78275 . 87600 . 19854 . 128360 . 130080 . 62439 . 152741 . 80640 . 73840 . 79599 . 140928 . 80481 . 81549 . 125992 . life: won jeong-hwa said she once disobeyed pyongyang's orders to assassinate two south korean army intelligence officers with poison. she also said she fell in love with a junior officer in the south korean army . the trial verdict and an investigation by prosecutors said she slept with numerous men, including south korean officers and her boss at an agency where she worked. won said she used sex as a spying tool only once, to steal personnel management-related documents from an army major's home computer. she said she couldn't resist pressure by prosecutors who gave her alcohol and urged her to confess during questioning. they \"manufactured (the story of) my relations with men,\" she said. 'i'm not a mata hari.' prosecutors have dismissed won's claims. south korea has a history of forgiving former spies and assassins, though they are still sometimes ostracized. their careers in the media often depend on whether they were involved in high-profile cases that captured global attention, and whether they followed seoul's propaganda line against the north. won said a prosecutor told her during her questioning that she could make a new start in the south by following in the footsteps of kim hyon-hui, a north korean agent sentenced to death for bombing a south korean jet in 1987, killing all 115 passengers aboard. kim was later pardoned and wrote a best-selling autobiography. she often appears on tv to speak critically of north korea. several other north koreans who once attacked the south now embrace it. previous life: while working undercover for north korea's late dictator kim jong-il, won jeong-hwa would steal sex secret about his rivals in the south . one of the 31 north korean commandos who launched a brazen mission to assassinate south korea's president in 1968 is now a christian pastor who lectures about the north. a north korean crew member of a submarine that ran aground in the south, and who was captured alive after a massive manhunt that left 25 other comrades dead or missing, is a lecturer for the south korean navy. a spy arrested after a deadly shootout in 1995 works for a think tank run by the south's spy agency and wrote a book about his mission. won, on the other hand, feels trapped. no south korean tv station wants her as an expert because of reports that she may not have been an elite spy. finding work unrelated to her past is also impossible, she said, because no one wants to hire an unskilled woman with a criminal espionage record. one of the jobs she gained and quickly lost was at a noodle restaurant. she said a former colleague later told her the boss had been worried she would poison the food. the army officer won fell in love with has been released, but they are no longer in touch. nor is the father of her 12-year-old daughter in the picture: she said he is a south korean businessman she met in china, where she had been assigned to find and repatriate north korean defectors before she was sent to south korea. won said the government assistance she gets was not enough for her to even buy a school uniform for her daughter. a center that helps female ex-inmates gave one to her. many defectors shun her. she said her neighbors once asked that she move, and that her daughter's friends have been told by their parents to stay away from the girl.

'sleepy hollow': after four years of studies, scientists have finally discovered the cause of a mysterious illness which caused people to fall asleep for days . radiation: scientists say radon, which occurred naturally from uranium in nearby mines, seeped to the surface and poisoned the residents of kalachi . deadly: radon - a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas - is thought to cause lung cancer and has affected around one in five people in kalachi (pictured) radioactive remains: although radiation levels in the mines themselves are not thought to be dangerous, they have left a deadly legacy for the villagers above . professor leonid rikhvanov from the department of geo-ecology and geo-chemistry concluded the local mines were to blame after ruling out a virus or bacteria as the cause. he said: 'the mines left open spaces underground which were slowly filled with water that has risen upwards, driving pockets of gas inside them to the surface. 'the gas has a toxic effect that pushes a person into a dream like state, and the person then falls asleep.' professor rikhavanov and tomsk polytechnic university have carried out thousands of experiments on the area for over four years. they failed to find radon because conventional methods of measuring radiation do not detect it in the air. he added: 'we eliminated viral and bacterial infections but also obtained test results that ruled out the possibility of radiation sickness too. 'we also failed to find any evidence that toxic chemicals were buried in the area as many locals claimed.' initially, medics who examined the dozing villagers found they were suffering from excessive fluid in the brain but could not work out why. desperate measures: local government officials in kalachi (pictured) are now considering plans to move the village entirely . infected: children affected by the mystery illness are so dizzy they can barely stand up by themselves and spend days at a time in bed . nightmare: professor leonid rikhvanov from the department of geo-ecology and geo-chemistry said the 'toxic gas' induces its victims 'into a dream like state' doctor egor korovin, who examined the victims, said: 'in medical terms they are suffering from encephalopathy, a disorder of the brain but the cause is unclear. 'scans have shown that many of the sufferers have excessive accumulation of fluid in their brains.' according to the national cancer institute, radon decays quickly, giving off tiny radioactive particles. when inhaled, these radioactive particles can damage the cells that line the lung. long-term exposure to radon can lead to lung cancer, the only cancer proven to be associated with inhaling radon. there has been a suggestion of increased risk of leukemia associated with radon exposure in adults and children however, the evidence is not conclusive. radon is present in nearly all air. everyone breathes in radon every day, usually at very low levels. however, people who inhale high levels of radon are at an increased risk of developing lung cancer. last summer, 60 people were taken to hospital suffering from the condition which leaves people feeling dizzy, unable to stand, fatigued and with memory problems. children affected by the mystery illness could barely stand up by themselves and spend days at a time in bed. scientists recently stepped up their investigation after locals complained the situation was getting worse. it is thought nearly one in five of kalachi's 600 residents have been affected by the strange sleep disorder. scientists stepped up the investigation recently after locals complained that incidences of the strange sleeping disorder were getting worse, with nearly one in five of the village's 600 residents now affected. they said the fact that some miners remained unaffected because they have built up a natural immunity to radon. alsu shjeladeva, a local resident, said some men from the area had gone down the shaft in one of the mines and detected a sweet smell while down there. the 54-year-old told russia today: 'we are afraid of what lies in store. we're afraid that we may all fall asleep.' ghost town: kalachi's neighbouring town krasnogorsk has been deserted since the closure of the neighbouring uranium mine . terrifying discovery: a russia today film crew found radiation levels at a filled in mine shaft were 16 times higher than normal background levels . top secret: in the soviet era, krasnogorsk was a secret and 'closed' uranium mining town run directly from moscow . another resident igor samusenko, whose son suffers from the condition, said: 'he runs around and then he gets inert, starts staggering. 'when he turns his head his eyes stay fixed at what he was looking at. if you try to wake him it seems the wants to open his eyes but can't. sleepy valley, sleepy hollow, that's what people call us.' lyubov belkova, 60, claims to be the first resident to have fallen asleep in april 2010 and has since suffered seven separate episodes. she was diagnosed with ischemic strokes but then her neighbour began displaying the same symptoms. some have even reported suffering from vivid hallucinations. in september 2014, a russia today film crew reported radiation doses 16 times higher than would be expected from background radiation near the entrance of the abandoned mine. some locals claimed wind and smoke coming from the mines may be responsible for the illness. others claimed toxic waste has been buried in the area.

drooping beneath the weight of their deep red fruit. pickers are working every daylight hour in kent and herefordshire. after a campaign to revive british cherry farming, this most luscious of fruits is back and — thanks to this year’s weather — yields are nearly treble those of 2012. the cherry-growing harvest is expected to be worth £20 million, up from just £7.5 million last year, and the season is set to last longer than ever, well into september. ‘last year we picked 100 tonnes. this year we expect to pick 250,’ says sarah neaves, a third generation cherry farmer from kent. the greatest cherry harvest ever? trees are leaning over, drooping beneath the weight of their deep red fruit and pickers are working throughout the day in kent and herefordshire . ‘this season has been great for us due . to the dry weather and plenty of light, but we also had a very cold . winter, which cherry trees like because they can hibernate.’ cold . and frosty weather allows the trees to ‘shut down’ and build reserves . of energy for blossoming and fruit. it also kills pests and fungus that . can wreck harvests. sarah . leads me along a neat line of cherry trees being harvested on her . family’s farm near sittingbourne. the neaves’ orchards are planted in . small, hedgerow-lined fields, with tall poplars acting as windbreaks. dry weather and plenty of light after a cold spell are ideal conditions as cherry trees can hibernate in winter . at one end are the beehives, home to the all-important pollinators. on every tree, perfectly firm and shiny cherries in varying shades of crimson are decadently large. each bunch, the size of a man’s hand, must weigh a pound. and between the glossy dark leaves, there are at least one hundred bunches on every tree. the pickers, wearing traditional leather-belted wicker baskets around their hips, bury themselves among the leaves to get to the fruit. ‘we only pick fruit that has reached . the right shade — the colour tells you how ripe the fruit is,’ says . sarah. ‘cherries continue to ripen after picking, but only a little, so . it’s important to pick them when they are perfect.’ seven years ago, the neaves’ farm had 30 acres of old cherry trees, but they mainly grew apples and pears. cherry farming had dramatically declined. where there had been 5,000 hectares of cherry orchards in kent at the beginning of the 20th  century, by the end there were just 600. ‘the fruit was small and the quality low. the supermarkets were buying cheap fruit from france,’ says sarah. after we joined the common market, british fruit growers, who did not get an agricultural subsidy, found they could not compete with cheaper imports. thousands of acres of cherry orchards were destroyed. a cherry picker at work. sarah neaves, also a cherry farmer, from kent, says: 'i think the most fantastic thing is how beautiful these trees are. i just love to come to work every day' (picture posed by model) supermarkets used to be full of cheap fruit from france, but there's a renewed interest in homegrown food . ten years ago, with a new interest in . home-grown produce and the cherry aid campaign led by henrietta green of . the crusading food lovers britain movement, farmers looked again at . cherry farming. richard harnden, director of research for berry gardens . growers, says that the old way of farming cherries had to go. we needed . to adopt the practices of french, german and belgian growers in order to . compete. ‘in kent’s orchards, we grew huge trees, so long wooden ladders were needed for picking,’ he says. ‘it was picturesque, but it was just not practical. with today’s health and safety considerations, pruning and picking would be impossible.’ the trees in the neaves’ new orchards are small. just before they blossom, they are enclosed by metal frames covered with rain-proof plastic and netting at the sides to protect the fruit from its great enemy — birds. helen green, pictured, led the cherry aid campaign which energised farmers to look at cherry farming again . the gisela dwarf rootstock that the neaves planted in 2006 is german: the bushy, high-yielding trees can be easily picked and covered for protection in the growing season. their farm, little sharsted, is no longer little with 85 acres planted with cherries. the family has grown fruit there for more than 50 years. sarah’s grandfather archie took on the farm, and her father brian followed him. sarah, 46, went into insurance when she left school, but came back to the farm at the age of 23. she runs it with her brother edward and farm manager william dixon. they work with eight other farms in kent, herefordshire and scotland, growing fruit for supermarkets. an old barn is now a packing plant. they employ some locals, but most of the 60 pickers and packers are students from lithuania, bulgaria and romania. the conditions in which they live and work, their pay and hours are bound by ethical audits. many return season after season. the new british cherry is very different to the fruit you used to see being sold by the side of the road or in markets in the towns and cities. during a short season in july, you could . pick up a brown paper bag of small, firm, bright red cherries weighed . out by the pound. they were a real treat. when i was a little girl, my . friends and i would hang pairs of cherries from our ears as pretend . earrings. it was the seventies and our mothers would never have allowed . us to get our ears pierced, so the seasonal summer cherry served as a . delightful — and edible — substitute. the fruit we loved then are now . heritage varieties, which originated from the wild mazzard or gean tree, . which grew up to 75 ft high (you can only imagine the health and safety . issues involved in picking them). varieties . derived from these ancient trees include the romantically named merton . heart, roundel heart, florence and waterloo. today, few of these are in . commercial production, but some survive in old kitchen gardens and . ancient orchards. the new british cherry is different to the fruit once sold by the side of the road or in markets in the towns and cities . unusual among these are the white frogmore, one of the earliest cherries of the traditional season, or the gorgeous, orangey red, golden fleshed napoleon. sour cherries still grow in old orchards — black varieties such as morello or the kentish red. merchant is an early heritage variety still grown in kent, grafted onto the super-efficient gisela stock. but most of the big sellers are modern fruits, with kordia being the favourite. big, deep ruby red and full of sweet juice, it tastes amazing. my only criticism is that it is too large to fit in my old-fashioned cherry stoning gadget. so these magnificent fruit have to be pitted by hand before i can make jam and puddings. all this abundance shows british cherries have fought back to become a prominent crop. ‘as the trees mature they will yield more and more,’ says sarah neaves. she chooses a cherry from one of the baskets on the ground and eats it. ‘i think the most fantastic thing is how beautiful these trees are. i just love to come to work every day,’ she says.

You get straight to the point.\n<<\/SYS>>\n\nWhat are the important parts of this article?: momentum in the senate may be building for passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill after a border security deal was announced this week, but house gop opposition to immigration legislation remains the biggest roadblock to a bill getting to the president's desk, and that opposition only appears to be hardening. senate immigration deal includes tougher border security . the messy demise of the farm bill on the house floor on thursday demonstrated the divisions within gop ranks and the willingness of dozens of rank-and-file members to ignore their leadership.  while there's not a clear parallel between that bill's failure and the road ahead for immigration reform, the episode does underline the exceedingly tough task house speaker john boehner, r-ohio, faces as he attempts to guide immigration legislation through the house. boehner insists he wants to tackle immigration reform, but hasn't been clear about how he intends to navigate the controversial issue through his own conference. cnn poll: big generational divide in immigration battle . \"after all this talk about the senate there has been so little focus on the house and that it has been, pre-farm vote -- and will continue to be post-farm vote -- the choke point for any immigration reform, \" amy walter, national editor of the cook political report told cnn. house gop leaders knew many conservatives would vote against the farm bill because they viewed the food-stamp programs as too expensive.  but 62 members, roughly a quarter of all house republicans, broke with boehner, who made a rare endorsement of the bill, and joined with the vast majority of house democrats to take down the bill.  even if democrats produced the level of support republicans say they anticipated, gop leaders still didn't have support within their own ranks to get the farm bill through. the farm bill's defeat \"exposed the vulnerabilities of so called compromise legislation in the house,\" walter added. but even before the farm bill fiasco boehner began pouring cold water on the immigration momentum coming out of the senate.  as news was breaking on the senate deal on thursday morning boehner compared immigration reform to obamacare, the bill republicans constantly malign as the prime example of government overreach. \"every day as obamacare is being implemented, americans are reminded of what happens when you have big legislation rammed through congress with minimum support,\" boehner said at his weekly news conference.  \"americans' confidence in their government is near an all-time low, so if immigration reform is going to work it's essential that we have the confidence of the american people and that it's done the right way,\" the speaker added. the deliberate move to put immigration in the same category as obamacare showed boehner is in no mood to muscle through a massive immigration overhaul unless it can garner significant votes from both sides of the aisle -- a tall order in the house. boehner didn't comment directly on the new \"border surge\" provisions that would double the number of agents on the u.s.-mexico border or the new money to construct a 700-mile-long fence.  but he raised questions on whether that plan would be enough to address concerns among conservatives, saying, \"if we're going to get the kind of bipartisan support i think we need, and we're not going to get that confidence unless the american people look up and say, 'yes, this border security package meets the straight-face test.' \" another key house gop player on immigration reform, judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte, r-virginia, was skeptical that the senate's border security plan was going to work, telling reporters, \"just throwing bodies at it\" does not solve the problem. goodlatte said the larger issue is addressing the 35%-45% of the 11 million people in the u.s. without legal status who he says enter the country lawfully -- through visas, but are allowed to overstay or gain a waiver to remain.  he argued there has to be a bigger emphasis on interior enforcement programs.  and goodlatte repeated his intention to move immigration reform through a \"step by step\" process instead of the sort of comprehensive bill the senate is considering. navarrette: border security push is a joke . \"anything attached to a path to citizenship even if it secures the border i wouldn't support it,\" pennsylvania republican rep. lou barletta said when asked by cnn about the senate's new border security plan.  barletta said he could support additional resources but said he wanted \"a guarantee\" that enforcement measures in fact worked, and he thought what the senate was doing would end up speeding up eventual citizenship for undocumented workers, something he said was unacceptable. \"i don't have any confidence that it's ever going to be implemented, \" iowa republican rep. steve king told cnn when asked about the senate border security plan, saying he didn't believe secretary of homeland security janet napolitano would follow the law. the dynamic inside the house republican conference on immigration could be seen outside the capitol on wednesday afternoon with two groups delivering polar opposite messages about immigration policy. house gop conference chair cathy mcmorris rogers, r-washington, held a news conference with several house republicans and a group of hispanic religious leaders and stressed the party's outreach efforts to latinos on immigration.  just yards away, the loud voices of a hundreds of activists opposed to a path to citizenship -- branded \"amnesty\" -- could be heard at an event king organized. boehner already made it clear earlier in the week that he would only move an immigration bill if it had the support of the majority of house republicans.  but even if he gets more than half of the 234 house gop members, he'll still needs to rely on house democratic leader nancy pelosi to get most of her members on board to pass a bill. democratic support for immigration reform has never been in question.  but house republican congressional aides, still incensed about the failure of the farm bill, question whether democrats on capitol hill are more focused on scoring political points in the next election than joining with them to pass a bill. \"how are we supposed to trust a promise or a whip count from house democrats now?\" one senior house gop leadership aide said when asked about what the farm bill's defeat means on immigration. walter noted that all along many republicans on the hill have been suspicious about how serious congressional democrats were about actually getting an immigration bill over the finish line. \"it speaks to this deep seeded belief among many republicans that democrats are going to pull the rug out from them and use it to beat them about the head in 2014,\" walter explained to cnn. the senate could be on track to pass its immigration package before july 4, but the bipartisan group in the house that has been working for months on a similar proposal hasn't been able to finalize their deal yet. the house judiciary committee has begun working on more narrow proposals aimed at enforcement and security, and those could come up for votes as early as next month. even those in the house who are pressing for major immigration reform say it's unlikely to play out in the house until later this fall. but that schedule poses difficult decisions for boehner about how to move immigration as it comes around the same time as the house has to deal with an equally divisive issue -- addressing how to deal with the country's debt limit. biden urges final push on immigration reform .

'i am going to disappoint you by not now drawing great red lines,\" he told the bbc radio 4 today programme.

'i have always felt that you have a referendum when the time is right, when something happens which merits that referendum,\" he said. 'if you look back at the development of the european community, and subsequently the european union, every few years the rules of the game - these cumbersome treaties - are changed and new decision-making authority is pooled at european level.

He described the incident as a \"very bad thing\" and said he was not proud of his actions. The incident occurred in the summer of 1983, when Clegg was a student at Westminster School in London. He was part of a language exchange program and was staying with the family of a German judge who was also a collector of rare cacti. One night, after getting drunk with a schoolfriend, Clegg ventured into the conservatory where the cacti were housed and singed the \"beards\" of several plants with his lighter. Five or 15 cacti were damaged, depending on who was recalling the incident. Clegg admitted to his crime and said he was not proud of it, describing it as an example of \"rare anti-europeanism.\" He also revealed that he had been punished for his actions, including doing community service in a suburb of Munich.

'they examined it, they weighed it, they said you have to fill out this form,' his father, also named jon, told the associated press in a phone interview on tuesday, december 11. but when hammar and his friend crossed the border and handed the paperwork to mexican officials, they impounded the rv and jailed the two men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun - which they deemed to be an inch too short. hammar's friend was later released because the gun did not belong to him. the hammar family's attorney eddie varon-levy said mexican law prohibits civilians from carrying certain types of guns, like sawed-off shotguns, which can be more easily concealed. mexican law prohibits shotguns with a barrel of less than 25 inches. varon-levy said . mexican officials measured the barrel on hammar's shotgun as 24 inches and that it has not been sawed off. family members said the gun was . purchased at sears and blamed u.s. officials for telling hammar he could . bring it across the border in the first place. hero: hammar was a combat veteran who had been treated for ptsd just before his arrest in mexico . distraught family: hammar's parents jon and olivia hammar, are now fighting for their son's safe return from mexico . varon-levy also questioned the way mexican officials measured the gun, because the measurements can differ depending on where they are taken on the barrel. he said dealing with mexican authorities has also been difficult. he said hammar was brought to court a few weeks ago, where officials tried to convince him to plead guilty without a lawyer present. varon-levy said he didn't show up because he was told there was a continuance. 'i am fuming,' he said. hammar could face 12 years in prison, but varon-levy said that is unlikely. he wants to get the charges downgraded, in hopes that hammar can plead guilty to a lesser charge of carrying an unregistered weapon, which carries only a fine. hammar served in iraq and afghanistan before being honorably discharged from the marines in 2007. his mother said surfing helped him cope after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. hammar developed ptsd following the death of a fellow marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet . when the two served together in fallujah, iraq. he had just completed . treatment at a center for veterans in california last year, . before getting detained during his misadventure in matamoros. weapon in question: hammar had his great-grandfather's antique rifle inspected at the border, but he was arrested for carrying it anyway . ricardo alday, spokesman for the mexican embassy, said in a statement: 'mexican authorities have fully guaranteed his right to consular assistance; therefore mr hammar has been in contact with u.s. consular officers in mexico who have regularly visited him. 'the possession of any weapon restricted for the use of the army in mexico is a federal crime, regardless of whether you declare it or not upon entering the country, and must be automatically prosecuted.' alday said harmmar has the right to defense counsel and a fair trial 'as any other detainee facing criminal charges. 'in addition, his life and integrity are protected by national and international laws.' in danger: hammar is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters . still, hammar is being held in one of the most dangerous areas in mexico. matamoros is the active headquarters of the gulf cartel, which has been fighting with its former running drug routes along the eastern end of the texas-mexico border. a fight among inmates at the prison in october 2011 left 20 dead and 12 injured. when first arrested hammar was held with the prison's general population, which is filled mostly with members of drug cartels. now, the 27-year-old marine veteran is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters, according to his father. the two occasionally speak to one another over the phone. 'sometimes he's got his head on good. we're like just, \"hang in there. we're doing everything we can,\"' said jon hammar senior, a 48-year-old software engineer. 'other days, it's like, it's not as good,' in august, the family received a frightening middle of the night phone call from the cartel demanding money, jon hammar senior said. '\"lady, this isn't about the police. this is our house. we have your son. we're going to kill him if you don't send us money,\"' jon hammar senior said, recounting the phone call. the couple planned to wire the money to an account, but officials at the u.s. consulate intervened and contacted prison officials. his son was moved into a private cell the next day, he said. peter velasco, a spokesman for the state department, said officials have visited hammar three times, spoken with him by phone and contacted prison officials to stop them from chaining him to the bed. 'the safety and well-being of u.s. citizens is something we take very seriously,' said velasco. u.s. senator bill nelson, a florida democrat, spoke on the senate floor tuesday, december 11, asking mexican authorities to release hammar. jailed: hammar was taken into custody right after crossing the border from brownsivlle, texas, and is now being held at a prison in matamoros . u.s. rep ileana ros-lehtinen, of florida, said: 'this is just an outrageous case.' she was contacted by hammar's mother olivia, who asked the republican congresswoman for help. she added: 'if the parents had not told me about it, and his friends had not gotten involved, i would say that it was just not possible for someone to be in so much trouble for doing the right thing.' ros-lehtinen also urged the state department to work incessantly to reunite hammar with his family and said she's disappointed the agency has not told her what efforts have been made. the miami republican said she plans to contact the department of homeland security and customs and border patrol about hammar's arrest.

home, eagle, the lunar module that transported neil armstrong and me to the bleak, crater-pocked moonscape. standing there and soaking in the view, i called it as i saw it: \"magnificent desolation.\" as neil and i walked upon the surface of the moon at tranquility base, we satisfied a vision held by humankind for centuries. and as inscribed on the plaque fastened to the ladder of our lander: \"we came in peace for all mankind.\" sunday will mark the 45th anniversary of the lunar landing, when neil announced, \"tranquility base here. the eagle has landed.\" it was, truly, one small step, but more steps are needed to fuel and assure america's leadership role in deep space exploration. i'm often asked just how lonely it was on the moon. first of all, what got us there was the tireless effort of some 400,000 people who shared a universal dream. project apollo was a unified enterprise that relied on teamwork. second, while we were farther away from terra firma than any humans had ever ventured -- with our colleague mike collins circling the moon in the command module above us -- the three of us were connected to home planet earth. close to a billion people watched and listened to our journey. in reflecting back on that thrilling, transformative time, several things come to mind. standing on that harsh, desolate, yet magnificent terrain, stealing precious moments, i looked back at earth. everything i knew and loved lay suspended on a far away and fragile blue sphere that was engulfed by the blackness of space. in the back of my mind were neil's words about a step on the moon. imagine the great magnificence of humanity going from horse and buggy, to railroads, cars, and airplanes, to rockets -- and now walking on the moon. that is a testimonial to the progress of the creatures here on earth. i couldn't have imagined anything more desolate -- knowing it hadn't changed in hundreds of thousands of years. you couldn't find any place like that on earth. the airlessness. brilliant sunlight illuminated the dust, which was everywhere. and the horizon, visibly curving away in the distance, was so clear because no pollution obscured it. walking across that landscape was much easier than we had thought it would be. when my boot struck moon dust, it flew away in a straight line, a sign of the lighter gravity load, one-sixth that of earth. i didn't anticipate, returning to earth, that america's triumph was viewed as a success for all humankind. people expressed their collective pride by declaring \"we did it!\" -- there was an aura of ownership of the achievement. although we can revel in taking rear-view mirror looks at the apollo 11 mission, the urgent need, i believe, is to confront the future. our space program should not focus on getting back to the moon. we have already blazed that trail. apollo was part of a clear, get-there-in-a-hurry, space race strategy. to be blunt, that meant we didn't spend time developing re-usability. it's time for commercial and international interests to move, beyond discovery, to development. other nations, china in particular, are working toward the exploration and development of

'it's really more to weaken a title on a label that we've worked very hard for,' said jeff arnett, the master distiller at the jack daniel's distillery in lynchburg, tenn. 'as a state, i don't think tennessee should be bashful about being protective of tennessee whiskey over say bourbon or scotch or any of the other products that we compete with.' republican state rep. bill sanderson emphasized that his bill wouldn't do away with last year's law enacted largely on the behest of jack daniel's corporate parent, louisville, ky.,-based brown-forman corp. the principal change would be to allow tennessee whiskey makers to reuse barrels, which he said would present considerable savings over new ones that can cost $600 each. 'there are a lot of ways to make high-quality whiskey, even if it's not necessarily the way jack daniel's does it,' sanderson said. 'what gives them the right to call theirs tennessee whiskey, and not others?' sanderson acknowledged that he introduced the measure at diageo's urging, but said it would also help micro distilleries opening across the state. diageo picked up on the same theme. 'this isn't about diageo, as all of our tennessee whiskey is made with new oak,' said diageo executive vice president guy l. smith iv. 'this is about brown-forman trying to stifle competition and the entrepreneurial spirit of micro distillers. 'we are not sure what they are afraid of, as we feel new innovative products from a new breed of distillers is healthy for the entire industry,' he said. special blend: jeff arnett, the master distiller at the jack daniel distillery in lynchburg, tennessee tests the aroma of whiskey at the distillery. jack daniel's is fighting efforts in the state legislature to dial back the legal definition of tennessee whiskey, including a provision that requires the spirit to be aged in new oak barrels . jack daniel's last year sold 11.5 million cases of it black label last year, a 5 percent increase from 2012. dickel, the second-largest tennessee whiskey producer, sold 130,000 cases in 2013. the standards and special branding of tennessee whiskey are an outgrowth of the special designation granted long ago to bourbon. a half-century ago, congress declared bourbon a distinctive product of the united states. by law, bourbon must be made of a grain mix of at least 51 percent corn, distilled at less than 160 proof, have no additives except water to reduce the proof and be aged in new, charred white oak barrels. spirits that don't follow those guidelines can't be sold as bourbon. one example is brown-forman's own early times, which is marketed as a 'kentucky whisky' because it is made in reused barrels. billy kaufman, the president short mountain distillery in woodbury, tenn., said it is more difficult to distinguish spirits not meeting the tennessee standard. 'if i made whiskey in tennessee in a used barrel, what it would be called then?' he said. 'whiskey, made in tennessee?' david mcmahan, a lobbyist representing dickel and popcorn sutton distilling, said the law passed last year would require all tennessee whiskies to taste like jack daniel's. preparing to fight: a law that was introduced last year says the whiskey must be made in a way that resembles almost to the letter the process used to make jack daniel's . 'it's not unlike if the beer guys 25 years ago had said all american beer has to be made like budweiser,' mcmahan said. 'you never would have a sam adams or a yazoo or any of those guys.' but tennessee craft distillers are divided about the state law. charles nelson, the ceo of nelson's green brier distillery in nashville, said he supports tighter regulation. 'holding ourselves to a higher standard will ultimately be better for all the people in the category,' he said. 'if we lower the standards, it could lead to more products and brands that could lower the reputation of tennessee whiskey.' whiskey is clear when it goes into the barrel. it's during the aging process that the whiskey acquires color and flavors. jack daniel's arnett said other distillers reusing barrels might resort to using artificial colorings and flavorings that wouldn't match the quality of the whiskey stored in new barrels. 'we've been making whiskey a long time, and we know that would not uphold the quality that people expect from tennessee whiskey,' he said. 'so we wouldn't dare consider doing it, even though it would save us millions of dollars every year.' change in the law? lawmakers are looking at amending that law so that some of the craft distillers that have sprung up in recent years can label their products tennessee whiskey, a distinctive and popular draw in the booming american liquor business. the people behind jack daniel's see the hand of a bigger rival at work, however, the foreign-owned conglomerate that makes george dickel, another famed tennessee brand . jack daniel's stores its whiskey in new barrels made at a brown-forman plant. sanderson argues that the flavor and color of the whiskey is determined more by the charring of the inside of the barrels, which he said is a process that can be repeated. consumers would ultimately decide whether the end product matches up. 'if they're making an inferior product, the market will decide,' he said. [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":".

'people on benefits should face the same choices as working families, including where they can afford to live,' he said. the cap was welcomed by the centre for social justice think tank, which was founded by mr duncan smith in opposition. executive director gavin poole said: 'members of the house of lords should think twice about opposing a reform that will help tackle child poverty in the uk. 'our present system traps families in dependency on state handouts and sends a corrosive message to the two million children who live in workless households. 'deprived of the role model of a parent who goes out to work and earns a living, many of these children will simply repeat this stultifying, destructive cycle, graduating to an adult life on benefits.

the cancer,' and there was some desire to not do that,\" he told the leveson inquiry into press ethics. former murdoch employees testified earlier that they told him about the problem. he was testifying before an independent british inquiry into journalistic ethics prompted by phone hacking at the defunct news of the world, once the flagship british sunday tabloid of news corp. the scandal has reverberated through the british political establishment, led to dozens of arrests on suspicion of criminal activity and forced news corp. to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking. tuesday's hearing revealed the depth of the links between the murdoch family and british politicians, with murdoch saying he had had drinks with david cameron at a pub before cameron became prime minister and dined with him once he was in office. leveson inquiry lawyer robert jay pressed murdoch over the extent of his contact with politicians as the company moved to take full control of satellite broadcaster bskyb, a bid that collapsed because of the phone-hacking scandal. evidence published tuesday suggests that news corp. was getting inside information from the government minister with the power to approve or block the acquisition, culture secretary jeremy hunt. hundreds of pages of e-mails painted a picture of a back channel between hunt's office and frederic michel, a top murdoch employee. michel told murdoch in january 2011 that he had gotten \"absolutely illegal\" information about government plans related to the takeover plan, the e-mails show. prime minister cameron has full confidence in hunt, his spokesman craig oliver told cnn after the murdoch testimony concluded. hunt's portfolio includes the london olympics, which are now less than 100 days away. james murdoch and his father, rupert murdoch, have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them. rupert murdoch is scheduled to appear wednesday and perhaps thursday morning at the inquiry. the younger murdoch has already been called twice to testify before british lawmakers and resigned from a number of top management positions at british subsidiaries of his father's media empire. he and his father have always denied knowing about the scale of phone hacking, which police say could have affected thousands of people, ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans. james murdoch said tuesday that he had no reason to look into illegal eavesdropping by his employees when he took over the company's british newspaper subsidiary in december 2007. a news of the world reporter and a private investigator had been sent to prison that year for hacking the phones of the staff of princes william and harry, but murdoch said he had been assured that the problem went no further. \"i was not told sufficient information to go and turn over a whole bunch of stones that i was told had already been turned over,\" he said. \"i don't think that, short of knowing they weren't giving me the full picture, i would've been able to know that at the time.\" the journalist who went to prison, clive goodman, had been saying that phone-hacking went beyond his case, leveson inquiry counsel robert jay said. \"i was not aware of that,\" murdoch replied. he told the leveson inquiry on tuesday that he did not decide what went into the company's british tabloids, the sun and the news of the world, relying on his editors to make the decisions. he was also pressed on his relationship with british politicians, including former prime minister tony blair and the current leader, cameron. he acknowledged meeting with them, but denied having lobbied them improperly about his family's business interests. and he denied having made a \"crass calculation\" about how the sun's endorsement of cameron's conservative party before the 2010 elections would affect news corp. dozens of people have been arrested in criminal investigations into phone and e-mail hacking and police bribery, and police asked prosecutors last week to charge at least eight people. the suspects include at least one journalist and a police officer, the crown prosecution service said, declining to name them. no charges have been filed, and the crown prosecution service said it did not know when a decision would be made about charges. the british government set up the leveson inquiry, the independent investigation that summoned the murdochs, in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. two parliamentary committees also are looking into media conduct. james murdoch, 39, resigned as chairman of british sky broadcasting this month, saying, \"i am determined that the interests of bskyb should not be undermined by matters outside the scope of this company.\" rupert murdoch testified before lawmakers in july alongside his son. news corp. shut down its british sunday tabloid, the news of the world,

in new york last week, exploring options for a u.s. case against the company. attorney mark lewis said he is representing three or four new clients, one of whom is believed to be a u.s. citizen, who say their phones were hacked while they were on u.s. soil. there are also many other potential new clients, lewis said. \"as i've been traveling here,\" he said, \"i've been contacted by many people

the debate over female bishops started soon after women were ordained as priests 20 years ago. the cofe set up the committees and inquiries that led to yesterday’s vote in 2000. what went on before? the vote in the general synod that was meant to finally approve women bishops ended in narrow defeat for reformers in november 2012. who is opposed? anglo-catholics, who believe the bible and tradition do not allow women bishops, and conservative evangelicals, who believe the bible says women should not be church leaders. what is different now? in 2012, it was felt there were too few provisions for those opposed to female bishops. but church leaders have now drawn up a new compromise, including a dispute procedure. how does the new plan work? the cofe has laid out principles saying that women shall have the full powers of male bishops and that everyone must recognise the decision. all dioceses, even those dominated by traditionalists, must include a junior bishop who will ordain and promote women. but it recognises that opponents of women bishops have the right to ‘flourish’ – so there must be ‘pastoral and sacramental provision’ for disputes. what about disputes? church councils which oppose the move can send their bishop a resolution stating that they do not want a woman vicar or clergy, nor any male priests who have been ordained by women bishops. they should then be sent male clergy when jobs become vacant. if an objecting parish is in a diocese run by a woman bishop, she will allow it to be supervised by a male junior bishop. if no junior bishop is available within the diocese, one can be brought in from outside. what if there are still arguments? there will be an appeals system, in which parishes can turn to an ‘independent reviewer’. but if a parish does not accept an appeal decision they can be subject to disciplinary action, which can culminate in dismissal from the church. sally barnes, pictured right, is overwhelmed with emotion beside hilary cotton after the synod in york . the first appointment may be seen as an anti-climax, with a woman picked to fill a junior post, subordinate to a male bishop. after . the vote, the archbishop of york led the general synod in a rendition . of we are marching in the light of god, with members clapping along, . some even shedding tears of joy. reverend . dr rosemarie mallett, from southwark diocese, said yesterday: ‘i’m . absolutely joyful, thank god after 20 years of very hard work we now . have a decision that can help us work for everyone in the church. yesterday’s vote came nearly 20 months after the church’s last attempt to approve a law allowing women bishops. the lost synod vote in november 2012 left the then archbishop of canterbury, rowan williams, humiliated and apparently with little hope of reviving the cause for several years. but a new compromise, which allows scope for traditionalists to challenge the appointment of a female bishop in their parish, was brought to the vote in record time. the plan is based on the hope of compromise between opposing liberals and conservatives. archbishop welby said cofe members must ‘continue to demonstrate love for those who disagree on theological grounds’. he added: ‘as delighted as i am for the outcome of this vote i am also mindful of those within the church for whom the result will be difficult and a cause of sorrow.’ during the debate, guildford traditionalist adrian vincent said he would reverse his position from 2012 and vote in favour. ‘by doing so, i am betraying what i believe, i am betraying those who trusted in me,’ he said. ‘i hope that the promised commitment to mutual flourishing is not a commitment that will run out of steam in a few years.’ but opponent dr chik kaw tan, of lichfield, said: ‘men and women are equal but their roles are not interchangeable ... if we allow the church to be guided by secular thinking our teaching will soon unravel.’ in 2012, the house of laity voted just six short of the necessary two to one majority. yesterday, it voted 152 to 45 for women bishops. members of the clergy arrive for the general synod of church of england meeting at the university of york . the archbishop of canterbury arrived for the general synod of church of england meeting at the university of york today . deputy prime minister nick clegg welcomed the 'watershed moment' for the church of england, after the synod overwhelmingly backed the measure to scrap the ban . more than two thirds of the members of the church of england's synod, pictured here during morning prayers this morning, voted for the consecration of women bishops . the most rev justin welby said the church had been wrong on women bishops 'theologically' for centuries . the archbishop of canterbury said he would be 'delighted' to see a woman take his role in his lifetime .

The new plan includes a dispute resolution procedure to address the concerns of those opposed to women bishops, and an appeals system for parishes that do not accept the decision. The Church has been urged to continue to demonstrate love and respect for those who disagree on theological grounds, and to work towards mutual flourishing."}

You get straight to the point.\n<<\/SYS>>\n\nWhat are the important parts of this article?: in america, summer holds a special place in our hearts: lazy afternoons, camping at the lake, warm evenings gazing at the moon. for children, especially, summer can unleash the free flow of discovery. for older children, summer often brings their first job. but this idyllic picture masks the reality that for too many children, particularly those from low-income families, languid summers can be educationally detrimental, and for families in which both parents work, summers are a logistical nightmare. considerable research shows that the primary reason the achievement gap between poor children and their more affluent peers widens over the course of their school careers is the long break in learning over the summer. it's called summer slide. during the school year, disadvantaged children manage to catch up somewhat to more advantaged students. but during the summer, they lose those gains while their more advantaged peers -- whose parents can afford to arrange for summer enriching activities -- maintain theirs.  and a persistent achievement gap among children only leads to economic and social gaps that continue into adulthood. these gaps destabilize our society. surely, eliminating the long summer break by making our school year longer, at least for schools serving poor neighborhoods, seems a ready solution to a problem that has enormously negative implications. an analysis of charter schools in new york by economist caroline hoxby revealed that students are most likely to outperform peers, both in traditional district schools and at other charters,  if they attend schools that are open at least 10 days more than the conventional year. families with resources can often find educational summer programs and camps that broaden their children's skills and then figure out how to transport children to these activities. but even so, the question remains: does it really make sense for children to be out of school for up to 12 weeks in the summer? requiring students (and teachers, for that matter) to stay in school for more days is complicated and must overcome at least two significant obstacles. first, more days of school usually carries a price tag to cover costs of additional staff time, transportation and keeping buildings running. second, although public attitudes are changing, overhauling such an ingrained institution as the long summer break won't be accomplished easily. the response to the first issue is to weigh the long-term costs of the summer break against the short-term costs of a longer school year. balsz elementary school district in phoenix, for example, has extended its school year to 200 days, paying teachers 9% more to work the additional days. since the longer year has been implemented, proficiency rates on state tests have risen, failure rates have fallen, and the achievement gap is disappearing. clearly, the relatively small increase in budget yields large dividends for the students who attend. students graduating middle school proficient in algebra and reading have opportunities open to them that are simply nonexistent for students at risk of  failure. then consider the brooklyn generation school in new york, which has developed a model in which the students in grades nine through 12 attend for 200 days, but the teachers, on staggered schedules, are there for only 180. that means they earn salaries equal to their peers throughout the city. there is no shortage of innovation that can bring the benefits of a longer year to students. and what of the idea that summer should be a time of respite from the stresses of school? there are two wrong notions wrapped up in this perspective. the first is that somehow summer is automatically a magical time for children. such may be the case for children from middle- and upper-class homes, but for those whose families can't afford camp or other activities, summer is often a time of emptiness and tedium. as one balsz fifth-grader, happy to be back at school in august, declared, \"sometimes summer is really boring. we just sit there and watch tv.\" the second, more significant, misperception is that school is automatically bereft of the excitement and joy of learning. on the contrary, as the national center on time and learning describes in its studies of schools that operate with significantly more time, educators use the longer days and years to enhance the content and methods of the classroom. it provides more openings for hands-on learning, student collaboration and inquiry-based learning, where students push themselves to learn. why shouldn't children have these same opportunities during the summer as they do in cooler months? it is true that just having more time, whether it's more days during the year or more hours during the day, does not guarantee a superior education. educators must use that extra time well and be committed to addressing individual students' needs and not waver in their drive for excellence. yet, we do know that teachers who lack sufficient time with students, and students who spend too much time away from productive learning, are fighting an uphill battle in an environment where we hold increasingly high expectations for our children. there is no reason to scale back these expectations. our future as a nation depends upon having a well-informed, highly skilled work force and citizenry. we should expect our schools to furnish today's students with the education they will need to excel in our global society. but we must also be willing to provide schools the tools they need to ensure this outcome, including the flexibility to turn the lazy days of summer into the season of learning. follow @cnnopinion on twitter .

'do you think tracey cared about the children when she stashed them in the room 15 feet from where she fired 11 shots?' said sac county attorney ben smith today. 'she should have lost any and all rights to make those kinds of decisions or to have an influence in her kids' lives when she executed somebody.' tracey richter is pictured during her first-degree murder trial in fort dodge, iowa. the mother who is serving life in prison for killing a neighbor in 2001 has been granted continued visitation rights with her two minor children, who were present in the rural iowa home during the execution-style slaying . in the ruling issued last week, judge whittenburg said roberts cannot move to his native australia with his 14-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl until richter's appeals are exhausted, even though roberts claims his temporary visa has already expired. sac county attorney ben smith said thursday that it is unbelievable richter maintains parental rights after a jury convicted her of shooting 20-year-old dustin wehde at their home in early in 2001 while the children – then 3 and 1 – were one room away. judge whittenburg said the 14-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl have a 'long, positive history with their mother,' whom she called an excellent parent. she said the visits will help 'bring closure to the sudden and traumatic events of the past year' in which richter was arrested and convicted of killing wehde as part of a plot to frame her first husband, john pitman, who is the father of her child bert, for a home invasion. ten-years ago tracey roberts was celebrated as a heroic mother who acted in self-defence to protect herself and her children from men who broke into her home in early, iowa and assaulted her. dustin wehde, her neighbour was found slumped at the bottom of a bed at tracey and michael roberts’ home in december 2001 in a pool of blood. one bullet had gone through his head and out of his eye socket. noah and mason roberts pictured with their mother tracey richter in this undated photograph (left) now live with their father michael roberts (right) she claimed that with her husband on a business trip, she was home with her three young children - bert, noah and mason - when dustin and another man barged through her unlocked door. roberts said one of the men choked her with panty hose, she lost her glasses and blacked out and woke to the sound of bert screaming, who was holding a baseball bat to protect his younger siblings. she said she ran to the bedroom and reached for the gun safe, as dustin tugged at her hair and yanked on her feet. when the safe opened, she grabbed a 9mm handgun and pulled the trigger. then she said she grabbed a revolver, spotted dustin moving and fired at him. he stopped moving and the second man fled. she later said it was only one man, not two, who got away. her attorney picked up on inconsistencies in roberts's story as she retold it. in different accounts, she said she fired from different positions. house: this photo shows the home of tracey . roberts in early, iowa. in 2001, she fired nine shots from two guns into . dustin wehde, a 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her . bedroom . murder trial: tracey roberts, now 46, left, . fired nine shots from two guns into dustin wehde, right, in 2001 - a . 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom . in january, 2011 sac county had a new prosecutor in ben smith, who went through years of files and months later filed a first-degree murder charge against roberts, who is now called tracey richter. and in november 2011 a court in iowa found that richter shot wehde several times at close range in the back of the head in her bedroom, and concocted an elaborate hoax that she acted in self-defense to protect her children after wehde and another man attacked her. it was established by the court that richter wanted to frame her first husband and father of her first child and paint him as the man who in fact hired wehde as a hitman to kill richter. the court heard this was because he was attempting to take sole custody of his child and was threatening to cut of the $1,000 in child support he was paying monthly to richter. and then a key piece of evidence emerged - a pink spiral notebook that had been recovered from wehde's car. in wehde's handwriting, it suggested he had been hired as a hit-man by a ‘mysterious fellow’ named john pitman iii, who was tracey's first husband. they split up four years after marrying in 1988. 'j.p. wants me to get\/force his ex t.r. to kill her son burt and then commit suicide, and if that plan fails plan b is to make it appear as though t.r. had committed the murder of her son & then committed suicide,' he wrote. tracey richter was found guilty of an elaborate ruse to frame her first husband who was threatening to cut of alimony payments . originally tracey richter was hailed as a hero for protecting her children against a home invasion but after the tireless work of sac county attorney ben smith her guilt was established in the murder of dustin wehde . but investigators never believed it was credible. dustin, a special education student, did not like to write and he had never met mr pitman. prosecutors suspect she had convinced dustrin to write the diary, perhaps on the day he died. roberts, on a business trip during the shooting, initially stood by his wife's account. but the two eventually divorced and richter took primary custody of their children until her arrest last year. roberts then moved with the children to a california city he has not disclosed, saying he fears for their safety. and days after her conviction, richter was caught sending letters containing roberts' social security number and other information that could be used to find him to an incarcerated wisconsin sex offender. the female judge has ruled that because richter held sole custody of her children for the ten years before her arrest she has a unique relationship with her children that needs to be preserved . a crucial piece of evidence that was presented during richter's trial in october was a pink notebook that the prosecution claimed was written by richter and not wehde - who suffered from learning difficulties . judge whittenburg ruled that richter's contact with the inmate was 'not consistent with the duties imposed on a joint legal custodian.' but she said roberts didn't present enough evidence to justify hiding in california, saying: 'it is michael who has created the distance and hardship that is attendant to visiting tracey in iowa.' whittenburg ordered roberts to disclose their address so richter can send her children mail, including tapes of her reading them books. in addition to the visits, richter was granted 30-minute phone conversations on the kids' birthdays. roberts' attorney, eric borseth, said he was considering appealing the decision, which he called the first of its kind in iowa. borseth said he was also exploring settlement options that would allow roberts and the children to return to australia, where he has employment opportunities and family support. remembered: the grave site for dustin wehde in . holstein, iowa. seen through the middle of the heart is the gravestone . of his father, brett, who committed suicide at that spot the year after . his son's death . 'we were disappointed in the ruling, primarily because we didn't believe it was in the best interests of the children to be visiting her at the prison,' borseth said. 'the biggest concern we have, other than the trauma of going to a prison and seeing your mom there, is that mom and her family have continued to blame michael for the predicament she's in.' smith, the prosecutor, said he believed the decision did not consider roberts' rights as a father. 'it's just mindboggling how somebody that is convicted of murder, fraud and perjury still gets a say,' he said. 'and not only does she get a say, the spouse is ordered to travel 1,500 miles to facilitate visitation with the very person that was convicted of the murder but yet blames him for it. can you imagine?'

You get straight to the point.\n<<\/SYS>>\n\nWhat are the important parts of this article?: few predictions are certain when it comes to the future of air travel ... except this one. it looks like being a lot more comfortable. a british company has come up with adjustable plane seats you can book to suit your shape and size. it means larger passengers need not worry about squeezing into uncomfortable, tight spaces, moving to business class or paying double – they just book an expanded seat to fit them. and families can enjoy more comfortable flights without taking up more overall space – mothers and fathers can add a few notches to their seats while smaller children can have theirs scaled down. the morph, as the seat has been called,  also allows for the possibility of slimmer travellers paying less for occupying smaller spaces. the design by london firm seymourpowell has already attracted attention from plane manufacturers such as boeing and airbus. details of passengers' sizes and needs will be fed into a computer and airline staff then adjust the varied seating arrangements at a touch of a button before take-off. morph works by replacing the traditional foam pads used in airline seats with a fabric that is stretched across the width of three seats, around a frame and over formers, a little like a hi-tech hammock. it promises comfort without reducing leg room . unlike traditional seats, which are created individually using foam padding, the new design is based around a single piece of fabric stretched across the back of a frame for three seats. another piece of fabric is placed along the bottom, creating a hammock-style chair. the frame includes ‘formers’ which move up or down underneath the fabric, allowing the passenger to alter the recline, as well as the height and depth of the seat pan, according to their size and comfort. crucially, the formers, which act as arm rests and dividers between the three seats, can also be moved left or right to alter their width, making the seats bigger or smaller. economy class airline seats are, on average, around 18in wide. squeezing into a small airline seat could become a thing of the past, but larger people might have to pay more for their airline seat if the new morph concept becomes a reality . but the morph seats would allow, for example, a couple travelling with a young child to book two larger 22in seats to improve their comfort, while the child would occupy a smaller and cheaper 10in seat. jeremy white, of seymourpowell, admitted that some airlines were resistant to charging people according to their size, but claimed passengers would welcome improved choice. larger travellers could see it as a better option than being charged twice over. ‘one airline told us that if they have an oversized passenger, they make them buy two seats,’ he said. ‘i can’t think of anything more degrading or humiliating than forcing someone to buy two seats because they are a bit wide.’ the seats can be reclined and adjusted to suit an individual's preferred seated position by moving the seat 'formers', which in turn morphs the fabric to provide a 'tailored fit and greater comfort,' according to the firm . mr white said the seats can also be adjusted to suit other needs such as privacy for lone travellers,  mothers with children, people working or less abled passengers. the seats are unlikely to be fitted into existing aircraft, so it could be more than a decade before the morph design is introduced. however, some airlines have already adopted similar seating plans. air new zealand’s dreamliners feature ‘skycouches’, a row of three economy seats that can be turned into a sofa. and earlier this year airbus announced it would be offering an additional two inches on some aisle seats on its new a320 jets to keep up with ‘demographic trends’. analysts have suggested imposing a ‘fat tax’ on passengers above a certain weight to cope with demands from larger passengers. in april, samoa air became the first airline to operate a ‘pay-by-weight’ system. [\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":", The article discusses a new seat design called \"Morph\" that could revolutionize air travel by providing more comfort and flexibility for passengers.

A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .  [EOT]  But I \u2019 m really surprised . I thought science and religion are not compatible , are they ?

Even Harvard University , which is a highly academic institution , is in a sense the product of religion .  [EOT]  Really ?  [EOT]  Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England .  [EOT]  Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ?  [EOT]  Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans .  [EOT]  How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?  [EOT]  That \u2019 s because in the 16th and 17th century , there was a series of religious reforms in England . Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries .  [EOT]  So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ?  [EOT]  Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College .  [EOT]  Why did they want to found a college ?  [EOT]  Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well .  [EOT]  Oh , I see .  [EOT]  Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name .  [EOT]  When did it begin to be called Harvard University ?  [EOT]  In 1639 , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .  [EOT]  It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion .  [EOT]  Therefore , it \u2019 s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion , there would note Harvard .

S .  [EOT]  I finally begin to get to know Harvard . It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor . I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard .

They are unfit for human consumption . And the Medical Officer of Health has issued a Stop Notice on them .  [EOT]  Is that so ? So far we haven't had any complaint of this kind . Our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years . We are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten . Have you any evidence ?  [EOT]  Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable .  [EOT]  Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage .  [EOT]  The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing .  [EOT]  As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export .  [EOT]  I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss .  [EOT]  The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment .  [EOT]  We've already got in touch with the underwriter .

[EOT]  Not really . I did some research about Chinese table manners . The important rule is to remain silent while eating . Of course , this refers to family meals only . Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health . It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party . The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won \u2019 t drop on their cloths . No noise should be made when chewing . No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn \u2019 t like it . One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise . All these table manners are very similar to Western habits .  [EOT]  It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background . Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles . We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people \u2019 s appetite.Westerners like to say , \u201c bon appetite \u201d before meals which is one way to suggest \u201c mind your table manners . \u201d Is there such an expression in Chinese ?

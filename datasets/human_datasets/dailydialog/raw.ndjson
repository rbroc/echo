[EOT] really? [EOT] absolutely! it was founded by a group of puritan immigrants from england. [EOT] why was it founded by the puritans? where were the atheistic educators? [EOT] because most of the first english immigrants who came to the united states were puritans. [EOT] how come? i mean why most of them were religious people? [EOT] that' s because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in england. many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries. [EOT] so, you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in england? [EOT] yes, that's why puritans moved to the new world, where they believed they could establish a heaven for puritans. later on, it was these puritans who founded harvard college. [EOT] why did they want to found a college? [EOT] many puritans had received classic style of higher education in oxford university and cambridge university back in england. they hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well. [EOT] oh, i see. [EOT] actually harvard was first named ' new college ', without a formal name. [EOT] when did it begin to be called harvard university?

[EOT] what is it, mrs. wang? [EOT] it's about the quality of 300 cartons of dried mushrooms. they reached us two weeks ago, and were immediately examined after they arrived. to our astonishment, about 20% of them were moldy and in many cartons there were even small brownish bugs crawling in and out of the half eaten mushrooms. we can't accept them in this state. they are unfit for human consumption. and the medical officer of health has issued a stop notice on them. [EOT] is that so? so far we haven't had any complaint of this kind. our mushrooms have enjoyed a good reputation for their superior quality for years. we are really at a loss to understand why your lot was found moldy and wormeaten. have you any evidence? [EOT] certainly. here's a survey report by a well-known lab in london, whose testimony is absolutely reliable. [EOT] though everything may be as you say, there are many factors involved. what's more, your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage. [EOT] the mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags, sixty of these bags to a carton. it is stated on the surveyor? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact. so it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing. [EOT] as you know, before shipment, the commodity inspectionbureau inspected the goods in question. they concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export. [EOT] i think the inspection bureau at your end, when effecting inspection, only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard. the part that was not dried properly, most probably, escaped their attention. as the amount in question is only 20% of the whole shipment, i think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss. [EOT] the inspection certificate, which is based on a random selection of 20% of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand, is considered final and binding upon both parties. we do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit, because you bought the goods f. o. b. houston and on shipping quality, not on landed quality. your claim, in our opinion, should be referred to the insurance company, as the mishap occurred after shipment. [EOT] we've already got in touch with the underwriter. but they have refused to accept any liability. they attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage. [EOT] that's a matter over which we could exercise no control, then. i'm afraid i have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement, that is, if you have covered this risk in your coverage.

[EOT] the westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated. the chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate. i assume it is less complicated, right? [EOT] not really. i did some research about chinese table manners. the important rule is to remain silent while eating. of course, this refers to family meals only. not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health. it is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party. the table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated. each dish should be placed in the correct position. when fish is served, the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty. if it is in winter, the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter. each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table. the diners should sit close to the table so food won' t drop on their cloths. no noise should be made when chewing. no one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn' t like it. one should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise. all these table manners are very similar to western habits. [EOT] it seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background. apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles. we do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people' s appetite.westerners like to say, \"bon appetite\" before meals which is one way to suggest \"mind your table manners .\" is there such an expression in chinese?", "human_completions": "yes. we say \"eat well and drink well .\"", "annotations": {"n-turns": 6, "source-emo": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "comp-emo": 0, "source-act": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "comp-act": 1}}

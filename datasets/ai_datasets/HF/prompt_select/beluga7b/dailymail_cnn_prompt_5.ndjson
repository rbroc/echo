'monday, january 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 bl86 will get to earth for at least the next 200 years,' said don yeomans, who is retiring as manager of nasa's near earth object program office at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena, california, after 16 years in the position. 'and while it poses no threat to earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' one way nasa scientists plan to learn more about 2004 bl86 is to observe it with microwaves. nasa's deep space network antenna at goldstone, california, and the arecibo observatory in puerto rico will attempt to acquire science data and radar-generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to earth. 'when we get our radar data back the day after the flyby, we will have the first detailed images,' said radar astronomer lance benner of jpl, the principal investigator for the goldstone radar observations of the asteroid. 'at present, we know almost nothing about the asteroid, so there are bound to be surprises.' don't panic! nasa says 'while it poses no threat to earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' asteroid 2004 bl86 was initially discovered on jan. 30, 2004 by a telescope of the lincoln near-earth asteroid research (linear) survey in white sands, new mexico. the asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars. 'i may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself,' said yeomans. 'asteroids are something special. not only did asteroids provide earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources. 'they will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system. there is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up.'\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" NASA has warned of an impending asteroid pass, with the space rock designated 2004 Bl86 set to pass about three times the distance of Earth to the Moon on January 26.

rolling out her video for the released-in-december \"army of love\" with video diaries building up to a december 22 premiere. \"it's like euro trash meets angels singing in a choir,\" kerli said of \"army of love,\" which continues to draw interest online because of the video, which has a curious mix of swirling melodies set against striking visuals (the clip was shot in estonia). adventurous college radio listeners have long been boosters of acts from the baltic states and other european countries, but mainstream pop fans rarely hear singers such as kerli on the u.s. pop charts. and while european artists who have \"made it\" overseas have been buying second homes in the hollywood hills for decades, more interesting are the new pop singers living nearby, such as slovakia's twiins, who are hoping against odds to make a name for themselves in america after a modicum of success elsewhere. the duo, who are identical twins, moved to l.a. last year. they are currently working on their first record for l.a.-based indie label b records with known u.s. producers including bryan todd, who has worked with names such as jordin sparks. \"we love los angeles because of the weather, nice people and shopping, but the main reason why we moved is our work,\" veronika nízlové said via email last month. her twin sister daniela added the transition has not been easy. \"it's really hard to come from eastern europe and try to achieve success in america. we are not native speakers, we are not americans...it's a little disadvantage to us, but our big advantage is that we are twins. \" twiins, which scored a minor european hit last year with a remake of sabrina salerno's 1980s hit \"boys,\" seem already savvy to the city's sometimes cruel undercurrent. in their forthcoming single \"welcome to hollywood,\" the pair warn other aspiring singers that not everything is sunshine and smiles in the city of angels. \"the song is not about the perfect hollywood,\" veronika said, \"it's about people with their 'friendly faces' which is far from being true. you should have open eyes and be careful whom you trust. hollywood and all that goes along with it really has two sides to it.\" sage advice from los angeles' latest émigrés, who sing on their soon-to-be released single: \"welcome to hollywood\/boy you better give it up before it gets you down\/welcome to hollywood\/just got to get a grip of how to get around.\"\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" This article discusses how European artists, particularly singers, are increasingly moving to Los Angeles to pursue their music careers in the United States.

'we wanted to make sure we kept the jury focused on the conduct that led to these people's sickness, but not let the case get into the medical history of every victim out there' with testimony on individual deaths, moore said. defense attorneys have acknowledged the georgia plant shipped tainted peanut butter and covered up positive salmonella tests, but they say the scheme was carried out behind the backs of the parnell brothers by two plant managers who pleaded guilty. the three defendants, charged with 71 total counts, still face severe punishment if convicted. prosecutors have said stewart parnell faces a maximum of 754 years in prison and $17 million in fines. and moore said he intends to present evidence of the deaths during sentencing if there are convictions. the centers for disease control and prevention, which tracked the outbreak from victims back to the plant, determined 714 people got sick in 43 u.s. states. three deaths were reported in minnesota, two in ohio, two in virginia, one in idaho and one in north carolina. but the cdc hedged when tying fatalities to salmonella. 'the nine deaths reported are linked to the salmonella typhimurium outbreak, but were not definitively caused by salmonella,' the cdc said in a may 2009 report. marler said all nine who died tended to be older people with other problems that made them vulnerable to severe effects from food poisoning. 'they have cancer, they have diabetes, they have heart disease and their immune systems are compromised,' marler said. 'there's no question they were infected. it's really about what prompted their deaths.'\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" 1.

chances of survival, say researchers. older patients who are given breast-conserving surgery and hormone therapy gain very ‘modest’ benefit from radiation treatment, they found. the findings suggest that carefully selected patients who are at low risk of recurrence could avoid the health risks and side effects associated with radiotherapy, such as fatigue and heart damage. some older women with breast cancer could safely avoid radiotherapy without harming their chances of survival, say researchers . currently older women with early-stage hormone-sensitive breast cancer are offered surgery to remove their tumour, followed by hormone treatment and radiotherapy. conventional external beam radiotherapy, which irradiates the whole breast, involves many hospital visits, often spread over several weeks to reduce side effects, such as tissue shrinkage. few trials have assessed the benefits of radiotherapy in older women treated using breast-conserving surgery, where the lump is removed not the whole breast. scientists at the university of edinburgh led an international trial involving 1,326 patients aged 65 or older with early-stage hormone-sensitive cancer, the most common form of breast cancer. their tumours were surgically removed and had not spread to the lymph nodes underneath the arm, says a report in the journal lancet oncology. half of the women were given radiation as well as hormone treatment and half were given hormone treatment alone. after five years, roughly 96 per cent of both groups had survived, and most deaths were not caused by breast cancer. katherine woods, of the charity breast cancer campaign, said: ‘these results are very interesting' around 1.3 per cent of those given radiation had cancer recur in the treated breast compared with 4.1 per cent of those who did not receive radiotherapy. pregnant women are more than twice as likely to quit smoking if they are offered shopping vouchers as part of a treatment plan, according to a study. researchers from glasgow and stirling universities divided 612 pregnant smokers into two groups. half were offered only advice and nicotine replacement therapy to help them stop smoking. half were offered up to £400 worth of vouchers to be used at stores including argos, boots and toys r us if they had the advice and treatment and quit while pregnant. according to a report in the bmj, 69 women quit from the group offered shopping vouchers, and 26 from the other group – 23 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. the results were confirmed by urine and saliva testing. after 12 months, 15 per cent of women who were offered financial incentives remained off cigarettes compared with4 per cent in the other group. the report says that widening the incentive scheme could produce public health benefits ‘as important as vaccines’. but critics are likely to claim ‘bribery’ is being used to get mothers to maximise the health of their children. in the uk around 5,000 babies a year die in the womb or shortly after birth from mothers smoking in pregnancy. professor ian kunkler, of the university of edinburgh’s cancer research centre, said: ‘while radiotherapy will remain the standard of care for most women after breast-conserving surgery, the absolute reduction in risk of recurrence from radiotherapy in low-risk older women receiving hormone treatment is very modest. this makes omission of radiotherapy an option for selected older patients.’ in the uk, around 50,000 women develop breast cancer each year – four out of five in the postmenopausal years after the age of 50 – and almost 12,000 women die each year. radiotherapy is offered to all women who have breast conserving surgery – around 35,000 a year. the edinburgh researchers stressed that the results were only applicable to patients aged 65 or older with grade 1 and 2, node-negative tumours up to 3cm in size. dr emma pennery, clinical director at the charity breast cancer care, said: ‘we know that some older women find the prospect of radiotherapy such a burden that they opt to have a mastectomy to avoid it, so this research will be hugely welcomed by many patients. ‘radiotherapy can cause side effects such as pain and fatigue, which can be very daunting. ‘however, this study is on a group of patients with a particular kind of breast cancer. findings also show rates of local recurrence were nearly 3 per cent higher in women who didn’t have radiotherapy treatment. ‘radiotherapy is still a highly effective treatment for many women with breast cancer.’ katherine woods, of the charity breast cancer campaign, said: ‘these results are very interesting. however, with only five years’ follow up the results do need to be approached cautiously.’\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":"

'then he puts the truck in drive, drives forward, running over him, and then keeps going forward and keeps on driving, and runs over carter, who is standing in the parking lot, and keeps on going after that,' corina said. he said witnesses told investigators it looked like an intentional act. authorities said they do not believe carter was involved in the altercation. blatt said knight was called to tam's burgers in compton by carter for a meeting and was attacked by four people, including sloan, as he slowed his truck. the men beat him through his window, tried to pull him outside, and threatened to kill him. knight punched the gas and fled in fear, blatt said. he had no idea he hit two men. corina said that claim is hard to believe, and there's no evidence thus far of four attackers. the incident came less than six months after knight was shot six times at a west hollywood nightclub in august — the second shooting he's survived. no arrests have been made. at 6-foot-4 and weighing 325 pounds, knight has a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited, in part, with helping create death row records when he strong-armed another label to release dr. dre from his contract, said chuck creekmur, ceo of allhiphop.com. knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting tupac shakur against biggie smalls in an east coast-versus-west coast rivalry. knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with shakur at a las vegas hotel, just hours before shakur was fatally shot while riding in knight's car just east of the strip. smalls, whose real name was chris wallace, was shot to death in a similar attack six months later. knight and dre later had a falling out, and dre left. the record company eventually declared bankruptcy and was auctioned off. dr. dre and ice cube, another former n.w.a. member, were at the film location thursday, but they didn't see knight. in november, knight pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed after a celebrity photographer accused him of stealing her camera in beverly hills. because of prior convictions, he could face up to 30 years in prison.\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" 1.

'the ideal comparison is raheem to deulofeu and for me raheem had the best season. that is a direct comparison. 'it is too easy to point the finger but if you take a step back to what we have got, we have some tremendously talented individuals. 'if you look at ross, he has a good physique, is good in the air, eats the right food, and more importantly loves the game. you cannot get him off the training ground. he had a couple of injuries when he was younger which set him back a bit and he did not get to play that much football because he was not around the first team at a young age. looking good: ross barkley is one of the young england stars picked for the world cup . 'this season has proved how much he has grown mentally. he went through a bad period but the manager stood by him and he came out of it. he has got the whole package, but we don't want to put too much pressure on him. 'people compare him to wayne rooney but they are not the same players. in terms of mindset, they are the same.' jagielka missed three months of the season with a hamstring injury, but finally returned to the everton team for the 3-2 defeat against manchester city on may 3. he added: 'i don't feel 100 per cent sharp but training with these extra layers on is perfect. i can only improve and hopefully if i can get some time on the pitch in these three games i'll soon be a lot fitter.'\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" 1.

'i think labour would wreck the recovery, and under the conservatives, who don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do, you’d get the wrong kind of recovery. 'so our message is: coalition is good; what the liberal democrats have done in government is good. let us finish the job, but let us finish it fairly.' the independent on sunday published a . poll conducted by the website liberal democrat voice, which found that . 39 per cent of activists questioned would prefer a lib dem-labour . coalition after 2015, compared with just 15 per cent who favour another . coalition with the conservatives. a further 15 per cent of those . questioned said that, in the event of a hung parliament, mr clegg's . party should forge a \"confidence and supply\" agreement with labour, . under which lib dems would not enter coalition but would undertake not . to bring down the minority government or vote against its budget. just 6 per cent wanted an arrangement of this kind with tories. mr . clegg predicted more coalitions in future, suggesting labour and the . conservatives will have to draw up a ‘shopping list’ manifesto, with a . handful of key policiies and others which could be haggled over during . coalition talks. he said: . ‘in my view it is going to more likely than not that in the future . you’re going to get more coalitions, it is less likely that you’re going . to these slam-dunk results when one or the other of the two major . parties always get a majority. ‘i . think it is incumbent on all political parties to be up front with the . british people – as we were  last time – about those issues which you . really will die in the trench for, and those which clearly will depend . on political and economic circumstances.’ blustery: many delegates were not well-prepared for the weather . wet wet wet: lib dem president tim farron (left) and pensions minister steve webb got caught out in the rain . in the pink: nick clegg boasted that his party was making a difference in government . he . said his focus was on returning to the lib dems to power in 2015, and . hinted at a desire to continue working with the tories on the economic . plan which is already underway. 'our . message to the british people in 2015 will be essentially this: we will . say: we’ve done very good things in government, but let us finish the . job and finish the job fairly. 'because . there are millions of people in this country who have made huge . sacrifices, we’ve gone through this very difficult time over the last . two or three years – that would be squandered if you had a single-party . government of either the labour [party] or the conservatives in 2015. 'i . think labour would wreck the recovery, and under the conservatives, who . don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do, you’d get the . wrong kind of recovery.' prediction: the lib dem leader told andrew mar there would be more coalitions in future - and all parties had to prepare for talks . damning: vicky pryce says it is a 'myth' that taxing high value property could be a source of income for the government . nick clegg stepped up calls . for higher taxes on the wealthy, as he signalled soaking the rich will . be a key demand of the lib dems at the next election. he said the party's commitment to a mansion tax on properties over £2 . million, raising £2 billion, sent a signal that 'even though we are . committed to deficit reduction' that would not be achieved entirely . through spending cuts. he told the bbc: 'taxes and particularly taxes on people . who can afford it, have to play some role in the ongoing effort to . making sure that we complete the job of filling the black hole in the . public finances. 'if the conservatives don't want to do . that then they need to tell people, and that's part of the debate we . will have to have over the next year-and-a-half, what they will cut - . schools or hospitals or pensions or police or the armed services - to . make up that £2 billion.' however mr clegg's plans for a ‘mansion tax’ have been savaged by vicky pryce – former wife of disgraced lib dem mp chris huhne. ms pryce says it is a ‘myth’ that taxing homes worth more than £2 million will be a ‘magic source of income’ for the government. ms pryce, who will attend the lib dem conference in glasgow, dismisses the whole idea of a . mansion tax, which has been blocked by the conservatives. in . an article for today’s mail on sunday, she says: ‘it is a tax that is . set at an arbitrary level with no  economic justification for that level . or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money’ and ‘a . mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just . waiting to be tapped’. ms . pryce also pointedly disagrees with her friend vince cable, the business . secretary, who has raised fears that coalition plans for low-deposit . mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble. ‘there are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by vince cable no less – but i don’t share them,’ she says.\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" The article discusses the increasingly stormy Liberal Democrat Conference in Glasgow, where delegates were battered by high winds and heavy rain.

'he was totally distraught over this stuff. and it all boiled down to money — people wanting settlements and stuff like that.' mcbath is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. the physician allegedly assaulted some of the victims at his mcbath medical center at 23933 17th street in dade city . under an emergency order issued by the department of health, mcbath was prevented from treating female patients at his mcbath medical center at 23933 17th street in dade city in december. according to the 34-page order signed by state surgeon general john armstrong and cited by wptv, mcbath repeatedly drugged and sexually assaulted a patient with a history of abuse between june 2009 and january 2014. the doctor diagnosed the victim with obesity, even though at the time the 5-foot-7 woman a weighed only 135lbs. he later diagnosed the woman with hormonal imbalance, chronic pain, anxiety and fatigue 'without any supporting medical justification,' the order states, and prescribed her a cocktail of adderall, xanax, hydrocodone and b-12 shots. on at least one occasion, mcbath allegedly injected a white liquid into the patient's vagina, telling her it would give her a stronger sex drive. in the course of her treatment, the 35-year-old woman came to mcbath's house and he instructed her to put on his wife's clothes, which she refused to do. family man: mcbath is survived by his wife, brenda (left), and his son and two daughters . the doctor and patient drank alcohol and used cocaine. the order states the woman then passed out and later woke up in mcbath's bed. with the woman slipping in and out of consciousness, mcbath injected her with an unknown substance in her vagina and then proceeded to have sex with her, along with another man who was at the house, the document claims. identified only as mr dh' in the order, the man allegedly had vaginal, oral and anal sex with the woman. mcbath later also penetrated her with his hand, causing her to bleed profusely. on another occasion, mcbath allegedly asked the patient to rub her privates with a cigar. months later, the doctor took a photo of the woman's vagina without her consent, the order states. in july 2004, mcbath's then-26-year-old intern reported an incident during which the married doctor came over to her house to teach her how to perform a varicose vain removal procedure. betrayal of trust: mcbath, pictured left and right with his wife, was accused of drugging a 26-year-old intern and exposing himself to her before she lost consciousnesses. he later said they had 'made love' both of them drank beer and mcbath gave the intern two blue pills telling her it was an antibiotic. the medicine made the woman feel woozy, which mcbath claimed was a reaction to the antibiotic. while mcbath was performing a 'chiropractic manipulation' on his employee, the order states he rolled her on her back, took her face in his hands and told her he had 'wanted to do this since the second day of work.' the well-respected doctor then started kissing her on her mouth and breasts despite her protestations, according to the order, before exposing his erect penis and asking her if she 'wanted some of this.' the intern then lost consciousness. she came to on mcbath's couch sometime later and was told by the doctor that they had 'made love,' the order states. the 26-year-old found her neck to be covered in 'love bites' and later tested positive for a sedative. 'egregious': the doctor allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted a 35-year-old woman with a history of abuse between june 2009 and january 2014 after misdiagnosing her with obesity . the most recent incident involving dr mcbath dates to april of last year when he allegedly gave his long-time patient a shot for a suspected urinary tract infection, which caused her to pass out. the 32-year-old woman, who has been mcbath's patient since age 14, woke up on his couch four hours later. she too tested positive for the same sedative as the intern. when the patient reported the incident to police, detectives had her call mcbath to talk to him about what happened between them, with officers listening in on their conversation. mcbath allegedly told the woman that they did not have sex and instructed her not to talk about this to anyone. mcbath, who has a wife and two grown children, has not been charged with any crime pending an investigation by the local sheriff's department. when contacted by tampa bay times for a comment on the allegations, the doctor has denied the patients' claims, calling them 'pathetic' and saying they were the result of retaliation, but he would not say for what. 'dr. mcbath demonstrated predatory behavior,' the emergency order in the case concludes. 'the number of patients that have reported the sexual misconduct and administration of substances without consent indicates that dr. mcbath's conduct will continue.'\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" Dr. Daniel McBath, a Florida osteopath, has died of a heart attack two months after being banned from treating female patients due to allegations of sexual abuse and professional misconduct.

'harry gets right in there and is pretty fearless when he plays, just like his personality. 'they say they love polo but can’t play as much as they’d like. they’re very sporty.' the princes’ team won 5-4 in the last few minutes of their game, with the event attended by a host of england celebrities including dame helen mirren and clive owen. alec couldn’t believe  the brothers, who introduced themselves casually as ‘will and harry’, were so normal. alec brown is a professional polo player, living in england and argentina for six months of the year. he grew up on his family property in nsw's upper hunter valley, with his grandparents and parents breeding and training polo horses . ‘i didn’t expect them to be the same as anyone else.

'i'll sometimes imagine when i walk through a park, if i could have sort of a 'rat vision,' there are all these tunnels under there that are occupied by rats. and from there the rats fan out.' financed with $611,000 in the current city budget, inspectors will work with neighborhood associations, community boards, elected officials and building owners to plug up holes and put poison in rodent tunnels. for years, inspectors responding to complaints on the city's 311 hotline have already been searching for rats and their telltale signs: burrows, droppings, claw marks and gnawed holes. besides traps and poison, the city also has used contraceptives to curb the rats. new york's rat information portal — or, appropriately, rip — is an interactive online map that tracks health department violations, with searches by borough, address, block number and zip code. spots marked red are deemed to be rat-infested; those in yellow have passed inspection. the south bronx around yankee stadium has the dubious distinction of being the city's most rat-infested neighborhood, according to figures from 2012, the most recent available. inspectors gave a failing grade for infestation to at least 13 percent of more than 3,000 locations inspected in that area. washington heights came in at 12 percent of inspected locations, west harlem at 10 percent and the lower east side and adjacent chinatown at nearly 9 percent. rats can carry and spread diseases, bite and trigger asthma attacks. in may, a fpur-year-old boy died after ingesting rat poison in a bronx homeless shelter. it's impossible to tally the exact number of rats in new york, says the rev. joel grassi, a baptist minister and professional exterminator. 'as long as there are human beings in new york city, there will be rats, because they live off human garbage — that's their no. 1 thing,' says grassi, adding that the best way to manage the rat population is to eliminate their food supply. just because your pet runs after backyard squirrels doesn't mean it could ever catch one. when at its best, the alley pack works together - one dog will sniff out a rat and signal its whereabouts, often by barking. another leaps at the hideaway to rout the quarry, and then a third lurches to catch it as it flees. a rat that scuttles into the open might get caught in a rundown, or even a tug of war, between dogs that circle and flank it. after making a kill with a bite or a shake, the hunters trot back, rat in mouth, and allow their owners to take it from their jaws. the night's kill ends up in a trash bin. the participants say they're less about killing rats than giving dogs the experience of chasing them. the health department declined to comment on the hunts. the idea has a long history. a noted 1851 examination of working-class life in london describes rat-catchers working the city's streets with ferrets and terriers. more recently, a rat-catching dachshund got attention in seattle when its owner happened by while city councilman tom rasmussen was checking out a downtown cleanup program in 2010. rasmussen snapped a picture of the dog, rat in mouth, and posted the photo on his website. there's even an american dog breed called a rat terrier, though its origins lie on farms. rat-tracking recently became an official canine sport, called 'barn hunt.' dogs get two minutes to sniff around a hay-bale maze and indicate where they smell a rat concealed in a crush-proof, aerated tube; the dog never catches the quarry. while dog owners may see it as time-honored pursuit, rat-hunting riles animal-rights advocates. people for the ethical treatment of animals, which opposes hunting in general, expressed outrage after video of a dog snatching rats in a new york city park surfaced online two years ago. peta spokesman martin mersereau calls the alley rat quests 'a twisted blood sport masquerading as rodent control.' reynolds counters that 'there are lots of worse things that people do to rats,' noting that poisons can sicken the animals for hours. as for the dogs, they have sometimes gotten stuck in waste bins or tumbled into holes, and a recent night left two with scrapes. but reynolds says none has ever been seriously hurt or fallen ill. in one recent foray, the dogs dispatched 13 rats within about a half-hour. the dogs prowled and prodded for about 90 more minutes before the group gave up for the night. # . but not to worry, said dachshund owner trudy kawami.

'before the world cup i showed him videos of marc overmars because he reminded me of him,' said rooney. 'he has the potential to be as good as overmars. bright future: raheem sterling was england's best player during wednesday's 1-0 win against norway . similar: wayne rooney believes sterling (left) shares some of the same qualities as marc overmars (right) captain material: rooney (left) has admitted showing sterling videos of overmars before the world cup . danger man: overmars scared opposition defenders with his pace and trickery in attacking areas . 63.6% - england’s win percentage against switzerland. they have won 14 of their 22 contests, drawing five and losing just three. they are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the swiss. 1 - good news for roy hodgson — england have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home. 192 - some bad news for hodgson. in 192 minutes of football, england have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot. 3 - wayne rooney looks a good bet to score at any time. the england captain has scored in each of his three appearances against switzerland. 2 - only two players have survived from england’s last game against the swiss — joe hart and jack wilshere both started that match at wembley in 2011. 17 - england like playing in basel. they have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game. that includes an 8-1 victory in 1963. 9 - switzerland have not lost at home for nine matches. their last defeat on home soil came against romania in may 2012. andrew magee . 'raheem is a fantastic and quite an unusual player. he can play right across the front line, out wide. although he's a small lad, he's really strong. the potential he's shown is incredible. he'll be a massive player for us over the next 10 to 15 years and, unfortunately, for liverpool.' overmars had terrifying speed and a clinical instinct. sterling arguably has a greater range of weaponry, but is still only 19 and developing. he is, nevertheless, the brightest spark in hodgson's post-world cup gloom. at the st jakob-park stadium here on monday night, england will look to him for creativity. four years ago, fabio capello's england arrived at the same stadium in similar circumstances. the world cup in south africa had gone badly and this was the first test for his team away from wembley. rooney was mired in front-page scandal at the time but he responded with the opening goal in a 3-1 win, which put capello in control on the road to euro 2012. hodgson could do with the same on his return to switzerland, where he is still feted for taking them to their first world cup finals in 28 years in 1994. 'winning this game does not make a great team in 2016,' said hodgson. 'neither does losing it make us a poor team in 2016. we are not in an embryonic stage — we are carrying on — but it is an early stage. we have to make sure after these next two years we are very, very strong.' wednesday's 1-0 home win over norway was not enough in itself to settle the anxieties that emerged in brazil. it is nearly two years since england actually beat any of the teams who qualified for the world cup. pivotal moment: wayne rooney scores from the penalty spot in england's 1-0 win against norway . challenges: roy hodgson will be without daniel sturridge and potentially jordan henderson on monday . preparation: hodgson leads his players in training at st jakob-park in basle on sunday afternoon . as ever, injuries have eaten into the squad. striker daniel sturridge's withdrawal on friday was more damaging than the loss of midfield rookie jack colback or back-up keeper ben foster but at least hodgson has danny welbeck ready to step in. if jordan henderson is not fit after twisting an ankle in training on sunday night it will bring another thorny problem — not least because england have brought only 17 outfield players — and challenge hodgson's theory that the nation is producing a breed of footballer no longer bound by positions. 'very few are classic number nines, or tens or sevens or fours or sixes,' hodgson said. 'they're not stereotyped. they're capable of different things. i've seen the under-20s play twice and when you watch them you do see a way in which english football is changing. i think back to the academy at blackburn 20 years ago and the type of players coming through now are different. 'it's difficult to look at an england team at any level and find a player who is not pacey, even a centre back. in the past we had stereotypical players who got by on the quality of their play. not now.' by the same token, he likes to think the style of his team is less predictable. 'the players we have are very different to the ones we had in 2012,' the manager added. 'we were a passing team. now we're a dribbling team. we're not a long-ball team any more. we try to pass through the midfield and create openings. we're athletic and pacey and technique is getting better.' hodgson refuted the accompanying theory that a 67-year-old coach might not be best-equipped to coach such modern footballers. stepping up: danny welbeck looks set to start for the three lions after an injury to daniel sturridge . settling : sterling (left) and his team-mates get used to the pitch on which they will face switzerland . all smiles: arsenal team-mates calum chambers (left) and jack wilshere (centre) share a joke in training . england will play on a monday for only the 10th time in 45 years when they face switzerland next week. uefa have spread out the qualification matches for euro 2016 as part of their new ‘week of football’ concept, with games taking place from thursday to tuesday. that means 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per cent in 2012 qualifying. the final set of fixtures in each group — scheduled for october 2015 — will still kick off simultaneously. england have only played nine monday games since 1966, but prior to that they were a regular occurrence. between 1880 and 1927, england played wales alone 33 times on a monday. the good news for england fans is their record is good... p...55  w...37  d...11  l...7 win %...67.3 . 'either you're a good coach or you're not,' he rapped back. 'either you know how to put your approach across or not. you just try to make sure the best players are in important places, and those around them complement them. that's how it's been since i started. i don't see any difference at all now to that.' and so, to the puzzle of where precisely to deploy sterling, who was so impressive at the tip of a diamond in the final 20 minutes against norway, after rooney had been replaced. does he keep him there or move him back to the wing, albeit with freedom to float? the team practised with the diamond midfield at times last week while at st george's park and, in the absence of sturridge, england can more easily revert to 4-2-3-1 without threatening rooney's place. 'there are options,' said hodgson. 'it's up to us to perform and play well. is it enough to come here and play 10 behind the ball and sneak a 0-0? no, i'd say it isn't.'\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" 1.

demi moore and actor ashton kutcher will be guests on thursday's \"piers morgan tonight.\" the husband-and-wife team launched the demi & ashton foundation (dna) after a visit to the u.s.-mexico border in january. they met a girl who had been trafficked into the united states by her pimp, who brought her into a field where she was repeatedly raped on a trash bag by 30 men. the dna foundation stands for the fundamental right to freedom for every person -- because it's within our dna. \"it just seemed impossible to live in a world where that was going on and not, you know, do something about it,\" said moore. more: the cnn freedom project: ending modern-day slavery . according to kutcher, the average age of entry into the sex trade is 13. \"and that's globally, by the way,\" added the actor, who also pointed out that many americans view child sex slavery as a problem in places that they have no control over, such as cambodia, india or nepal. kutcher wants to people to realize trafficking is prevalent in the u.s., too. traffickers are often \"average joes,\" usually in their early 30s. \"and what they're really doing,\" said kutcher, \"is profiting off the sale of these women and girls.\" these men seem like perfect guys to vulnerable girls from broken homes. pimps start off nice and generous in a ritual that moore likens to \"courting.\" sometimes they meet the girls online, establish relationships with them, take them shopping, make them comfortable and gain their trust. one of the so-called faces of human trafficking joined \"piers morgan tonight\" under concealed identity from an undisclosed location to provide a first-hand account of what morgan called \"the horrors of sex trafficking.\" the 17-year-old girl went by the name \"nicole\" for the purposes of the interview. when nicole -- who is an american citizen -- was 13, her father went to jail while her mother battled drug addiction. nicole began establishing relationships with men online, leading to a cycle of pimps, drug problems and even jail. moore recalled the story of a girl who, now 18, was just 11 when she was taken in by a pimp. in a similar fashion, he took her to mcdonald's, took her to the mall and made her feel safe. pretty soon she was forced into child prostitution and given a $1,500-a-night quota. if she didn't meet her quota, she was beaten or forced to sit in a tub of ice. her pimp's nickname was \"daddy day care\" because the girls he overpowered were extremely young. according to the girl, moore said, the pimp would load the girls into an overcrowded car -- so crowded that some rode in the trunk -- drive to las vegas, place ads on craigslist and have the girls prostituting almost immediately. siddharth kara, author of \"sex trafficking, inside the business of modern slavery\" also joined the show. kara said at a minimum, there are \"1.5 million traffic sex slaves in the world today generating profits in 2010 that exceeded $39 billion.\" moore reiterated that she and kutcher initiated the campaign \"to create awareness. you have to acknowledge a problem exists before you can actually go about finding a solution,\" she said. \"and what we've found is that most people aren't even aware of what's going on.\" moore and kutcher maintain that they will remain committed to the cause no matter how long it takes to eradicate child sex slavery. morgan asked the couple famously addicted to twitter -- kutcher has 6.5 million followers, moore has 3.5 million -- if it is smart to use social media as a tool to spread the word about their campaign when social media often makes it easier for child sex traffickers to operate. \"for me,\" said kutcher, \"i think i looked at this platform and thought to myself, 'this could be the collective consciousness, right?' this platform, in and of itself, a little shout here, and a little shout there. but the key was being able to drive a link into deeper, richer content into a tweet, and then have that tweet be syndicated. \"i don't believe that there's a problem in the world that exists that the solutions didn't exist before the problem. so that's why we're using social media for this campaign,\" he said. \"it's to actually go right into the heart of where it's taking place. seventy-six percent of the transactions for child sex slavery is actually happening online. so if we can motivate people while they are online to do something about that, then we can make a dent.\" furthermore, kutcher urged people to visit sites such as craigslist and flag pages that appear to be about child trafficking. \"people can start to actually un-root this at its root,\" said kutcher, who urged people to go to facebook.com\/thednafoundation, put themselves in a video, share that video with friends and go to the action tab where the foundation outlines online initiatives. \"we want the social web to become the police for human trafficking online,\" kutcher told morgan. watch piers morgan

israel's conflict with gaza, it appeared to be holding, an israeli official said. \"we assumed it would take a while for the cease-fire to take hold,\" israel's ambassador to the united states, michael oren, told cnn. \"i understand now that it has taken hold. there hasn't been fire for a while and, of course, we are not firing, so there is a cease-fire.\" his remarks came after an israeli

effect at 9 p.m. (2 p.m. et). gazans took to the streets, firing guns into the air in celebration of what they considered to be a victory over israel's military. the agreement calls for israel to halt all acts of aggression on gaza, including incursions and the targeting of people, according to egypt's state news agency egynews. it also calls for the palestinian factions to cease all hostilities from gaza against israel, including the firing of rockets and attacks on the border. border crossings were to be opened thursday night, and the movement of people and goods across them was to be eased, it said. on the ground: follow updates from cnn's reporters . the agreement came after a day of negotiations that included clinton, egyptian president mohamed morsy and palestinian officials.

cited israel's destruction of buildings and killings that included civilians. \"this is their accomplishment,\" he said. \"they have nothing else to show. and our rockets continued to strike them until the last minute.\" israel will hold hamas responsible for any attacks from gaza, whether conducted by that organization or any others, regev said. he said the agreement reflects that

\"excessive and disproportionate use of force that endangers civilian lives is intolerable.\" long-term solutions for gaza and the palestinians in general must be found, he said. \"once calm is fully

The agreement called for Israel to halt all acts of aggression on Gaza, including incursions and targeting people, and for Palestinian factions to cease all hostilities from Gaza against Israel. The cease-fire came after a day of negotiations that included U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, and Palestinian officials.

seventy-three seconds was all it took yaya sanogo. well, 18 months, 19 appearances and 73 seconds, but when his first arsenal goal finally arrived, it was wonderfully timed. it was a strike to puncture the pressure and soothe the nerves. sanogo was engulfed by supporters and team-mates, while arsene wenger punched the air. a striker who had forgotten the way to goal had found the net at a most crucial moment, before the result was put beyond doubt by alexis sanchez, a striker who seemingly cannot miss. alexis sanchez runs towards the arsenal fans in celebration of his second-half strike against borussia dortmund . the chile international now has 13 goals and three assists in his last 20 games for arsene wenger's side . sanchez looks on as his curled strike puts arsenal into a commanding 2-0 lead on wednesday night . arsenal: martinez 7, chambers 7, mertesacker 6.5, monreal 6.5, gibbs 6.5, arteta 6.5 (flamini 66' 6.5), oxlade-chamberlain 7 (campbell 89'), ramsey 7, cazorla

16 games as he continues to rubbish the claim players need time to adjust in england. where would arsenal be without him? wenger may choose not to dwell on that. what was important for the manager was victory after three games without a win, which triggered familiar complaints about his strategy from some quarters. for the 15th consecutive year, he leads his team into the knockout stages of the champions league and wenger is fiercely proud of this record. there is even an outside chance of topping the group. there was a clean sheet and an encouraging performance from rookie keeper damian martinez but it was not all positive news. sanogo pulled a hamstring towards the end of the game and captain mikel arteta limped off with a calf injury which wenger admitted ‘looks quite serious’. injuries have compounded inconsistent form and the squad is stretched to its limits as it enters the busy festive schedule. at least wenger knows his decision to start with sanogo was justified. the 21-year-old was included ahead of lukas podolski on account of his ability to hold up the ball and bring others into the game, which he did instantly. the game had barely kicked off when calum chambers threw him the ball to fight for with his back to goal, near the edge of the dortmund penalty area. he held off the challenge of matthias ginter and flicked a pass to santi cazorla, who slipped the ball back to him. in front of goal, sanogo made no mistake. he looked offside but the flag stayed down. the emirates stadium sighed with relief and sang: ‘he scores when he wants!’ alex oxlade-chamberlain and sanchez zipped around on the flanks pulling yellow shirts out of line and allowed aaron ramsey to slide sanogo clear again. with a little more time to think, his actions were far less clinical and ginter had time to recover and make a block. jurgen klopp’s team, too fast and furious for arsenal in dortmund in the opening game of this campaign, were simply not the same. sanchez curls his 57th minute strike between two dortmund defenders to double his side's lead . dortmund's goalkeeper roman weidenfeller (right) dives at full stretch but fails to reach the striker from sanchez . yaya sanogo (right) wheels away in celebration of his second minute striker against dortmund on wednesday night . sanogo ran straight towards the arsenal faithful to celebrate his first competitive goal for the gunners . they, too, have seen confidence eaten away by injuries and languish third from bottom in the bundesliga, a fact overlooked by those who have decided klopp should replace wenger. dortmund made a sluggish start. it was midway through the first half before they got any toe-hold in the game and began to test arsenal’s fragile defence. even then it was not a severe test and klopp cut an agitated figure on the touchline. for a spell either side of the interval, ilkay gundogan enjoyed good possession in midfield and dictated the tempo, often searching to hit lukasz piszczek on the overlap. ciro immobile was close to connecting with a cross before henrikh mkhitaryan collected a nod-down from piszczek and forced a splendid save from martinez. like sanogo, the keeper had stepped forward when it was required. martinez thwarted mkhitaryan again and made late saves, including a terrific one with his right boot from substitute adrian ramos. the arsenal

shoots past dortmund keeper weidenfeller (right) to score the opening goal of the game . henrikh mkhitaryan (right) sees his first half shot saved by arsenal goalkeeper damian martinez . dortmund had emerged with greater purpose and adventure after the break but this only helped arsenal, offering more freedom to oxlade-chamberlain, cazorla and sanchez as they sprang on the counter-attack. roman weidenfeller made a fine save with his left hand to keep out a drive by sanchez which fizzed across the slick surface, but was stranded by a lob from the ox moments later. weidenfeller turned, expecting to see the ball drop into his goal, but it struck woodwork and bounced clear. oxlade- chamberlain held his head. the disappointment did not last. sanchez took a pass from cazorla in the inside-left area, ducked on to his right foot and curled a shot beyond the diving dortmund keeper into the far corner. klopp made changes in a bid to shake a reaction from his team, but they had

description of her arrival in bosnia 12 years ago, recounting a landing under sniper fire. clinton was responding to a question monday from the philadelphia daily news' editorial board about video footage of the event that contradicted her assertion that her group \"ran with our heads down\" from the plane to avoid sniper fire at the tuzla air base. tommy vietor, a spokesman for rival sen.

fire. there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.\" but news video footage of her

did not appear rushed. the video shows clinton spending several minutes talking with the group, including an 8-year-old bosnian girl who presented her with a poem, and later greeting u.s. troops. clinton has mentioned the sniper fire at least twice earlier in the campaign, including in december in dubuque, iowa, before the caucuses in that state. clinton's campaign has made foreign policy

so i misspoke -- i didn't say that in my book or other times but if i said something that made it seem as though there was actual fire -- that's not what i was told,\" she told the newspaper. \"i was told we had to land a certain way, we had to have our bulletproof stuff on because of the threat of sniper fire. i was also told that the greeting ceremony had been moved away from the tarmac but that there was this 8-year-old girl and, i can't, i can't rush by her, i've got to at least greet her -- so i greeted her, i took her stuff and then i left. now that's my memory of it.\" meanwhile, as

immigration legislation in the country, other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state's footsteps or stand back. arizona's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the united states illegally. it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them. critics, including immigrant advocates and the american civil liberties union of arizona, are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status. the bill made it through the state senate on monday after it was passed by the state house last week. it's now awaiting the signature of republican gov. jan brewer. supporters of the measure expect her to sign it. latino members of congress are calling on brewer to veto it. michael hethmon, general counsel for the immigration reform law institute, helped draft the language of the arizona bill. the institute is the legal affiliate of the federation for american immigration reform. on the heels of the arizona initiative, hethmon said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. he declined to identify the states, citing attorney-client privilege. \"arizona was meant to be the leading edge,\" hethmon said. \"if you are going to work on developing a state-based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- arizona is the place to do it.\" hethmon pointed to arizona's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform, noting that \"what's happening in arizona just didn't pop out of nowhere. it's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process.\" republican state rep. russell pearce, who sponsored the legislation in arizona, said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent. state laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to numbers from the national conference of state legislatures. in 2005, 300 bills were introduced. the next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009. about 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education. about1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year. hethmon cited the election year, the democratic leadership's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation. \"historically, not only in the u.s. but in virtually all industrialized nations, when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players,\" he said. whether arizona becomes the standard-bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation, said ann morse, the program director of the national conference of state legislatures' immigrant policy project. \"certainly states will look at it, but not in a rush,\" she said. with court challenges promised from opponents, states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it's costly, morse said. omar jadwat, the staff attorney with the aclu's immigrants rights' project, said following in arizona's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction. \"although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path, i think it's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter, that arizona's approach is the wrong one,\" he said. isabel garcia, a legal defender in arizona's pima county, blasted the bill as \"the most dangerous precedent in this country, violating all of our due process rights.\" \"we have not seen this kind of legislation since the jim crow laws. and targeting our communities, it is the single most largest attack on our communities,\" she said. pearce brushed off her criticism, saying, \" 'illegal' is not a race, it's a crime.\" \"we do not tolerate those who break into our country, just like we don't tolerate those who break into our homes,\" he said. hethmon praised the legislation as \"the most cost-effective and the most humane way to deal with the illegal immigration problem.\" \"every time you convince an illegal alien to self-deport, you bypass having to resort to direct physical deportation,\" he said. in addition to providing a model for other states, hethmon said the legislation in arizona and other bills in the works in other states also provide an example on the national level. \"the states are laboratories for democracy. the federal government is in gridlock,\" he said. \"we're providing models for the day when the ice breaks up on the hill and the legislative waters flow and the country decides to confront this problem in a realistic way.\"\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" 1.

minister yingluck shinawatra ordered work crews friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage, according to the state-run mcot news agency. but the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps, the bangkok post reported. health concerns were rising with the water. bangkok residents waded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials. the government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater. \"we were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters and every day we see children playing in the water, bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground,\" said annie bodmer-roy, spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency save the children. as floodwater entered homes, some bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave. thanyarat hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city. \"some families in southern bangkok had their house flooded,\" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded. \"the water level is 2 meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,\" she said. the military had set up a flood relief center, \"but now even that has water coming in it,\" she said. asked what help the government had provided, she said, \"we don't see that the government is doing anything much to help people, so better to help ourselves by getting out of bangkok.\" but the bangkok post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on saturday and take them out of bangkok. as of saturday, an estimated 1 million of the city's 12 million residents had left. another bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave. still, so many people had left that the streets were relatively quiet. panic buying had led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital, residents said. city officials bracing for more flooding have opened nine evacuation centers. officials urged tourists to steer clear of bangkok, while noting that many of the other tourist spots, such as phuket, remained dry and open for business. thailand's ministry of public health had transferred 280 of the capital's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry, the mcot news agency reported. the remaining 240 patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces by sunday, it said, citing permanent-secretary for health paichit varachit. health minister witthaya buranasiri said that, after months of flooding, 107,101 thais have been diagnosed with stress, 6,214 with depression and 878 at risk of suicide. in all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to mcot. the u.s. state department issued a travel alert on thursday, recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. it noted that most tourist destinations, such as phuket and chiang mai, were unaffected. u.s. ambassador kristie kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next. the united states has already provided civilian relief resources, including water pumps, water purifiers and life vests, she said, and two u.s. helicopters are helping the thai military determine the extent of the flooding. the floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, . are you there? share photos, video but stay safe . the government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas. the government has set up

swells in a 16-hour swim across the english channel to raise money for veterans on the 65th anniversary of d-day. a group of american students rest and warm up in between turns swimming in the english channel. they didn't make it to the shores of france, but the physical and psychological anguish was enough to remind them of the soldiers their journey was meant to commemorate. \"i recognize that i have not done anything. even an attempt to swim the channel -- and a failed attempt at that -- is incomparable to the sacrifices people make on a day-to-day basis for our country,\" said daniel decker, a graduate of the u.s. naval academy who is studying at oxford university on a marshall scholarship from the navy. \"at the same time, i'm happy we were able to raise some money to go toward veterans and raise awareness of the sacrifices they're making,\" he said. \"that's the best blessing i get from this -- not necessarily success for the hardship of our ordeal but the awareness raised, some recognition put toward people who really deserve it.\" decker, 22, is one of five reluctant heroes who left dover, england, around 10 p.m. friday, and set out over the channel's choppy waters, accompanied by friends, the captain of the suva and a representative from the channel swimming association. collectively, they swam about 23 miles in speedos and swim caps, slathered in petroleum jelly, against strong currents in waters that neared 55 degrees fahrenheit. swells reaching 6-7 feet steered them off course and knocked them against the boat at times before forcing them to turn around about 1.5 miles from their destination. \"i would have much rather touched french soil but, at the end of the day, we swam the english channel,\" said eric gardiner, one of two people aboard the ship who managed to avoid vomiting. \"i felt like an ant in a toilet bowl. it was kind of humbling.\" yet the group, which consists of two rhodes scholars and three naval academy graduates who will enter seal training after school, considers the mission a success, in terms of honoring veterans of the past and present. they raised $5,000 for the mission continues, a missouri-based nonprofit that helps wounded and disabled veterans serving their communities after they return to the united states. \"we, as a group, wanted to do this to honor the inspirational veterans of the greatest generation of the past. most of us had grandpas that fought in world war ii and as a result, this historical anniversary had a special significance to all of us,\" said scott erwin, a rhodes scholar and former department of defense employee who was injured in iraq. \"we also wanted to do something to recognize today's inspirational veterans. we chose mission continues because all of us believe in its mission of attempting to allow veterans injured in combat operations to continue to serve causes great than themselves when they return to us,\" he said. the mission continues provides wounded and disabled veterans with paid fellowships while they pursue service and leadership roles in the community, said co-founder eric greitens, a navy seal officer who used his combat pay to help start the organization. \"there are a lot of programs for wounded and disabled veterans designed to give them many things they need, like free backpacking trips, rental cars, access to heath care facilities,\" he said. \"but no one was giving them a challenge or an opportunity to continue their service to the country even though their wounds had cut short their military service.\" erwin and greitens, also a former rhodes scholar, met after erwin returned from iraq. through erwin's experiences recovering at the walter reed army medical center, he became involved in the mission continues, helping to raise funds after he went to oxford. erwin initiated the idea of the channel swim as a fundraiser about six months ago and recruited decker, gardiner, shipley and u.s. naval academy graduate joseph hess to the cause. they trained in coastal beaches throughout the winter, but nothing could have prepared them for the experience of a midnight swim in the english channel. \"i went in at 1 a.m. and it was completely black. you can't see anything other than the headlight of the boat and everywhere you look is complete blackness,\" said drew shipley, 25, another rhodes scholar who is working on his ph.d. in political sociology. \"we trained well but there's no way to train for those water temperatures, plus the sensory overload of being in the middle of the english channel in the middle of the night surrounded by darkness.\" the five swimmers took hourlong turns in the water, using the intervals on the ship to return to normal body temperature before they prepared to return the open sea. after his third time out, one of the swimmers returned with the look of a \"wild animal\" in his eye, according to his teammates, and fell into violent shakes. \"we got every layer of clothing we could on him, and we had to give him bear hugs to give him some body heat,\" said gardiner, another graduate of the naval academy, who is studying at queens university in belfast, ireland, on a navy marshall scholarship. \"he really left it all out there in the water. it was inspiring because he took it to that level.\" gardiner, 22, said it has been a dream of his to swim the channel ever since he visited the beaches of normandy in high school -- the same trip that inspired him to join the armed forces. \"it wasn't necessarily about glory, it was about d-day and charity and doing it as a team,\" he said. \"compared to what those who invaded on d-day had to encounter when they made it to the other side, this was chump change.\"\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" A group of

Remember, be safe, and don't do anything illegal.\n\n### User: What are the important parts of this article?: (cnn) -- remember the name: jordan spieth is only 20 years of age, but the golfer is already being mentioned in the same breath as tiger woods after a whirlwind start to his pga tour career. spieth, like woods, was a multiple u.s. junior amateur champion before dominating college golf in his freshman year. quickly turning professional, he became the first teenage winner on the pga tour in 82 years, and at this week's traditional curtain raiser to 2014 he finished second to veteran zach johnson at the tournament of champions in hawaii. johnson, the 2007 masters champion, carded four birdies in seven holes to pip joint third-round leader spieth by a shot on monday. the 37-year-old tweeted after his win: \"i love underdog stories\" -- a recognition of the youngster's growing reputation. spieth is one of cnn living golf's \"five players to watch\" in 2014, as he seeks to add to last year's maiden victory. along with three of the biggest names in the sport -- who enjoyed wildly varying fortunes last season --we have also cast our net in the direction of asia, where the emerging prodigies seem to get ever younger and ever more a threat to the established order on the pga tour. jordan spieth . starting 2013 ranked 810th in the world and having turned professional halfway through his sophomore year at the university of texas, spieth ended it as the pga tour's rookie of the year and with a place on the winning u.s. presidents cup team. so highly-rated was spieth, that his first victory on the pga tour at the john deere classic in july was hardly considered a surprise. he won a three-way playoff against defending champion johnson and david hearn after spectacularly holing from a greenside bunker on the final hole of regulation play to force the shootout. spieth then lost in a playoff for the wyndham championship to another promising young golfer, 23-year-old patrick reed and charged to fourth in the deutsche bank championship with a last-round 62. he ended the year just outside the world's top 20, earning the nod from fred couples as a captain's pick in the presidents cup. woods was a teammate in the comfortable victory over the internationals, and when asked about spieth the world no. 1 gave the following verdict: \"he's earned his way on here and he's played exceptional golf and his talent is going to take him a long way over the years.\" tiger woods . woods may have ended 2013 as the pga tour's golfer of the year, but will want to finally lose the tag of \"14-time major winner\" and close on jack nicklaus's all-time record of 18. woods has been stuck on 14 since winning the u.s. open in june 2008 with an injured knee which required surgery and a lengthy recuperation. his well-chronicled personal problems also clearly impacted on his career and it was only last year which saw the re-emergence of a golfer resembling the former all-conquering tiger. five wins on the pga tour were ample evidence, but in the majors his best was tied fourth at the masters and he will be focused on changing that stat. with youngsters like spieth emerging and veterans like arch-rival phil mickelson showing no signs of fading away, woods, who has just turned 38, knows this is a big year -- and the choice of venues for the majors could be in his favor. \"i'm really excited about the major championships next year. i've won at three of the four venues -- augusta national, valhalla golf club and royal liverpool -- and on pinehurst no. 2 (u.s. open), i'm trending the right way, having finished third and second,\" he told his own website. woods skipped the opening tournament of the year in hawaii to spend time with his girlfriend lindsey vonn -- who will miss the 2014 winter olympics in sochi due to her own knee problem -- before beginning his own buildup to the masters in april. he still holds the record low total at augusta of 270 back in 1997 when he announced himself to the wider sporting public with a stunning victory. rory mcilroy . mcilroy started 2013 as the world's top-ranked golfer and ended it as the sixth best after a series of on and off-course problems. with a new management team and a new fiancee -- he announced his engagement to danish tennis star caroline wozniacki on new year's eve on twitter -- the popular 24-year-old from northern ireland can enter 2014 with optimism. buoyed by an end-of-year victory at the australian open, mcilroy has renewed confidence in himself and his nike equipment after a big-money switch to the sportswear manufacturer at the start of 2012 that some linked to his poor form on the course. \"i'm confident with my game and confident where it's going,\" mcilroy told reporters. \"i won a major in 2011 and 2012 but not in 2013, so i'll try to make up for that with two this year.\" a bold prediction, but mcilroy clearly has the talent to back up his words and has been practicing hard in dubai ahead of his opening tournament of the season at the abu dhabi championship starting on january 16. he will lock horns with woods for the first time in 2014 at the dubai desert classic a fortnight later -- an early marker for the rest of the year. adam scott . scott was denied the \"triple crown\" back in his home country in december by mcilroy, who mounted a final round charge to win at royal sydney. following wins at the australian pga and masters events, it would have capped a triumphant 2013 for the 33-year-old from adelaide, who won his first major at augusta. scott also paired with jason day to win the world cup for australia and, combined with an impressive victory at the barclays, the first event of the pga tour's fedex cup playoffs, it left him second in the world rankings behind woods at year's end. many believe scott will reach top spot in 2014 and add to his majors haul, having shrugged off the disappointment of letting a four-shot lead slip to hand ernie els the 2012 british open crown. a dramatic playoff win over angel cabrera of argentina at augusta sealed his place in golfing history and he was also in contention at the british open and u.s. pga championships. scott performed strongly at kapalua in the tournament of champions, tying for sixth, to serve notice he will again be a force in 2014. lee chang-woo . both the pga tour, and in particular the women's lpga tour, are becoming accustomed to precocious teenagers from asia turning up in the united states and making their mark. last year it was china's 14-year-old guan tianglang who had greats like gary player singing his praises with his performances at augusta -- where he made the cut -- and subsequent pga tour events. in 2014, south korean lee chang-woo has the same opportunity after emulating guan and winning the asia-pacific amateur championship. that booked a place for the 19-year-year-old at the masters and also a spot at final qualifying for the british open. he is likely to grab the opportunities with both hands, having already mixed it with established professionals while still in the unpaid ranks. seoul-born lee tied for second with mcilroy at the korea open, the week before his asia-pacific win, and claimed victory in an earlier korean tour event. \"playing in the masters has been my dream since i started playing golf,\" he said. \"this is a great honor, i have never been so excited.\" guan could not repeat his heroics of 2012 and finished back in eighth, but lee was initially challenged in the final round by another young chinese star, dou zecheng, before the 16-year-old fell away on the back nine. the pedigree of the asia-pacific amateur winners is also strong. since 2009, all but one winner has made the cut at the masters. japan's hideki matsuyama, a previous qualifier by this route, achieved the feat twice and finished third in the frys.com open last october, the opening event on the 2013-14 pga tour calendar. lee will be hoping to make a similar impression to earn sponsor invites for pga events after the masters, while matsuyama has already proved he can mix it with the best while still in the amateur ranks.\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" The important parts of this article are:\n\n1.

'i want to inspire other people to cook instead of feeling intimidated about giving it a try,' he said. 'my philosophy is that if i can do it, then anyone can. 'everything you see me cook i am cooking for the first time - it is all about trying to inspire people who have never cooked to give it a go. 'i have done more than 700 videos to date, mainly recipes ranging from simple one-pot dishes, quick dinner ideas to cooking with kids or naughty desserts. 'i like to have fun, too, and often taste things people have been sending me or try and overcome food fears. basically, anything goes.'

'there is the spirit of the law, why are they making a personal profit from allowances which they receive from the taxpayer? in this case they very clearly are.' mr jackson said: 'all british citizens are entitled . to seek legal adjudication if the state’s actions are unfair or possibly . illegal and so i will be forcefully resisting their precipitous . litigation.' martin bell, a former mp, said mps should repay any profit they made on their properties . he disputes ipsa's assessment that the family home in his constituency rose in value by 20 per cent from 2010 to 2012, claiming house prices in the area actually fell by three per cent. 'at . my own expense, i have paid for an accurate recent expert valuation and . i have made a reasonable offer to ipsa to settle the matter and reduce . the legal costs which will have to be met by the taxpayer. 'my . valuation recognises the need for proper recompense to be paid to the . taxpayer to reflect their support for my housing costs between 2010 and . 2012, in order to fulfill my duties as both a london based legislator . and a constituency mp. 'ipsa . have negotiated with 70 other mps in a secretive and arbitrary manner . but in respect of my case, regrettably, they have refused to negotiate. 'i am merely seeking fair play and consistency and will pursue legal action to receive it.' payback: treasury minister david gauke and former farming sir jim paice have returned thousands of pounds . an ipsa spokesman said: 'one of the . most damaging aspects of the expenses scandal was the practice where mps . got taxpayer support to own a second home. that is why we said we would . stop this, and we have now done so. 'the . final stage in bringing this to an end was our allowing a short . transition period for mps who were already committed to second . mortgages. 'but in doing . this we set the condition that the taxpayer would want its share of any . increase in the value of the property. today we are publishing that . these capital gains are worth almost £500,000 to the taxpayer. 'one of the . most damaging aspects of the expenses scandal was the practice where mps . got taxpayer support to own a second home. that is why we said we would . stop this, and we have now done so' - ipsa spokesman . 'mps . knew this was the deal and agreed to the conditions at the start. in . valuing the property, it was important that we didn't rely on amateur . valuations or guesses from the web. 'instead, . we demanded formal valuations at the start and end, from the royal . institute of chartered surveyors - the most authoritative voice in this . field. 'we would only accept valuations from rics members or fellows - providing proper assurance on the value of the properties. 'we . required all mps to provide these independent valuations at the start . and end of the claim period. and we published the way in which the . capital gain would be calculated. the same method of calculation has . been applied to all 71 cases. 'stewart . jackson provided us with two rics valuations. as he has been unwilling . to pay the £54,000 due we have issued proceedings to recover the sum . through the high court.' among . those not asked for repayments were deputy prime minister nick clegg, . who claimed £9,104 on a home in his sheffield constituency, and david . miliband, who claimed £5,903 on a property in his former seat of south . shields.\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" 1.

'when the first application was taken down local people were delighted that it had gone away, but it's come back with very little adjustment. 'i understand people's frustrations.' residents say the plans, if given the go ahead will have an impact on the roads in the surrounding area . one representative for the catherine-de-barnes residents' association who has lived in the area for 31 years, but did not want to be named, said: 'there's no need for it. 'the borough has sufficient provision for the next 20 years.' leader of solihull council, conservative councillor bob sleigh, said he also agreed the needs of local people could already be met at the borough's current plots. he said: 'there is no need for this extra site in solihull. we have identified our population need and made provision for that. 'this is an extremely large proposal. 'obviously people are concerned about the scale of the development and its threat to greenbelt land around catherine-de-barnes. 'i don't believe the case has been made to overcome the very special measures which apply to greenbelt land.' the development - which would include 95 parking spaces for visitors - will become the country's biggest if it gets the green light . both cemeteries - which were submitted by different applicants but through the same agent, cemetery development services - have received backing from the muslim community in solihull, who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces. funeral director mohammed khalil, of birmingham-based zuq funeral services, said even 11,000 burial plots would barely provide enough space for the next 50 years. he said: 'the local muslim population is growing rapidly, but the cemetery muslims use is mostly handsworth which is nearly full. 'birmingham council are making some provision but we still need more in the vicinity of the population. 'don't forget, the people who came here in the 1950s and 1960s are now old and dying fast. 'before, they used to send people back home to their families in pakistan and bangladesh. 'but apparently now all their families are here and they have no-one back home. 'they are saying 'this is our country now.' 'we are living here and dying here so we should be buried here.'\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" Residents of a rural village in the West Midlands are objecting to plans to build Britain's largest Muslim cemetery on rural land.

Remember, be safe, and don't do anything illegal.\n\n### User: What are the important parts of this article?: (cnn) -- the crowd of farmers in the nile delta's sharqiya province cheered loudly whenever the neatly groomed candidate came out with a new promise. jobs! schools! better social services! a better future! he smiled broadly as the cheering swelled, wiping the sweat off his brow with a white handkerchief. he wore a freshly pressed white shirt with an open collar, under a well-cut blue blazer. he was the picture of authority and self-confidence. afterward, one of the farmers brushed off the other contenders in the presidential election as posers. \"there is no one else,\" he told me. \"the other candidates don't care about egypt. they've been hired!\" his candidate, hosni mubarak, easily won the election, back in september 2005, though there is little doubt it was rigged in his favor. it was another \"historic\" election, the first multi-candidate presidential election ever, though the challengers never had a chance against an incumbent backed by the vast resources and lack of scruples of the egyptian state. today, mubarak is under armed guard albeit in a luxury wing of a cairo hospital, awaiting the verdict from his trial in early june. much has changed since the last presidential election, but much remains the same. mubarak came from the military, and the military, in the form of the supreme council of the armed forces (scaf), still runs the country. while scaf has tried to talk the talk of the new era, all of its members rose through the ranks of the egyptian military with the blessings of hosni mubarak. according to the u.s. state department cables posted on the internet by wikileaks, midlevel egyptian army officers referred to field marshall mohamed hussein tantawi, the head of scaf, as \"mubarak's poodle.\" scaf has overseen the process that led to this presidential election, in which egyptians had the opportunity to choose their president from among 13 candidates on the ballot (although two pulled out of the race). since mubarak stepped down on february 11, 2011, scaf has stumbled from one crisis to another, reacting with violence and brutality against protesters, but often ceding ground when tahrir square filled and passions boiled. scaf has pledged to hand over executive power to a civilian president by the end of june. in theory, egypt is on the cusp of monumental change. these are heady days in egypt. everyone seems to be pontificating on politics, comparing candidates, pondering platforms. the election is everywhere. the airwaves are full of it, facebook and twitter are abuzz with it, the streets are festooned with posters and banners. on the surface it seems so different from the predictable, managed, officially sanctioned politics of the mubarak years. but the choice facing egyptians is, actually, little changed. under the old regime, hosni mubarak made it clear he was the champion of the status quo, holding back the islamist tide, led by the then-banned but tolerated muslim brotherhood. in this election, voters can choose the status quo -- with some lip service to post-revolutionary reality -- in the form of former foreign minister and later arab league secretary general amre moussa or ex-civil aviation minister and briefly prime minister ahmed shafik. or they can opt for a new islamic order, either with the full-on muslim brotherhood candidate, u.s.-educated mohamed morsi, or the islamic-lite candidate abdelmonen abol fotoh. add to the mix hamdeen sabahy, a nasserist who appeals to the leftists and the nationalists. in recent days sabahy's numbers have been rising, perhaps as a backlash against the paucity of choices among the front-runners. the establishment -- the bureaucracy, the military, the intelligence services and the business community -- clearly doesn't want to see the islamists come to power. tuesday, the semi-official cairo daily, al-akhbar, ran an ominous page-three story with the headline: \"beware of a military coup: the future will be frightening if the brotherhood reaches the summit of power.\" the source of this disturbing headline was none other than former vice president and veteran intelligence chief omar suleiman, quoted in the london pan-arab daily al-hayat. he painted a grim picture of the brotherhood setting up a revolutionary guard, along the lines of iran, to fight against the egyptian military. the military, he warned, does not know how cunning the brotherhood can be. another cairo daily ran banner headlines warning that if either of the islamist candidates wins it would be \"apocalypse now\" -- a mosaic plague of catastrophic proportions will descend upon egypt, with a breakdown in security, violence, kidnapping, thuggery and theft, massive capital flight, political isolation, unemployment, poverty, and illness. on top of all that, once the islamists have power, the paper predicted, they will murder all their political opponents. those who are opposed to the brotherhood tend to see them as forked-tongue taliban in ties, eager to impose islamic law, force women to cover up, and ban alcohol. but for egyptians struggling with rising prices and low wages, the brotherhood offers the promise of a better future. indeed, the view is not so grim among those who have received only the crumbs off the status quo's table. gamal, a bank clerk living in the old cairo district of sayida zaynab, will be voting for mohamed morsi of the brotherhood. \"the health system is in bad shape, as is education,\" he says. \"conditions for people in egypt are very, very bad.\" in the nile city of beni suef, farmer ashour darwish attended a crowded muslim brotherhood rally, eager to hear morsi speak. he supports the brotherhood, he told me, because they are champions of what matters to him: \"justice, transparency, implementation of islamic law, the plight of the poor farmers, and unemployment.\" the brotherhood's political wing, the freedom and justice party, won more than 40% of the seats in egypt's lower house of parliament in recent elections. after being hounded by the police and intelligence agencies for decades, they are finally free to operate, and aren't shy about flexing their muscles. jihad haddad, a young brotherhood member, sees no reason why the group should be shy about its power. \"we came by the vote of the people and by the choice of the people,\" he says. \"what we really want is application of real reform policies on the ground, and we can't have that opportunity if we are out of executive power.\" it would be rash at this point to make any predictions of who will actually win that executive power. the muslim brotherhood is a formidable organization that can mobilize its supporters and ensure a high turnout. they did it for the parliamentary elections and they'll doubtless be able to do it this time as well. but the prospect of both the legislative and executive branches dominated by the brotherhood worries many. magdi zaki works in the finance ministry, and voted for the brotherhood. but he feels they are novices in power, grandstanding on live broadcasts from the parliament, but doing little else. \"they have no political background,\" he says dismissive contempt, like a seasoned theatre critic dismissing a flop. polls of potential voters have been all over the place, but they do show that a majority of egyptians have yet to make up their minds. they debate the choices in taxis and buses, in the subway, in cafes, over breakfast, lunch and dinner, over twitter and on facebook, changing their minds between meals. one seasoned veteran of egyptian politicsâ€”who requested anonymityâ€”chuckled over the fickle nature of the voters, and puts it this way: \"this is the first time i've ever had people ask me, 'who do you think is going to win the presidential election?' i honestly have no idea.\"\n\n###

acquire an execution drug no longer made in the united states and whether the federal government would share its supplies, a federal spokeswoman said wednesday. the sole u.s. manufacturer of sodium thiopental, an anesthetic used as part of the lethal three-drug cocktail, announced last month that it would stop making the drug because the producer never intended it to be used to kill people. the u.s. shortage of sodium thiopental, also used as an anesthetic for brief surgical procedures, may force states to postpone executions and has forced them to look outside the country for a supply or come up with alternatives. those substitutes haven't been without controversy. in december, oklahoma used an anesthetic commonly used to euthanize animals to execute john david duty for killing a cellmate. additional controversy surfaced last week about the drug's shortage when six death row inmates filed a federal lawsuit seeking to prevent the food and drug administration from importing the drug, saying the imports may be unsafe. in a letter last month to u.s. attorney general eric holder, the attorneys general in 13 states said injection is the execution method in the majority of states with a death penalty, and protocols in those states use sodium thiopental, \"an ultra-short-acting barbiturate.\" \"sodium thiopental is in very short supply worldwide and, for various reasons, essentially unavailable on the open market,\" the letter said. \"for those jurisdictions that have the drug available, their supplies are very small -- measured in a handful of doses. the result is that many jurisdictions shortly will be unable to perform executions in cases where appeals have been exhausted and governors have signed death warrants. \"therefore, we solicit your assistance in either identifying an appropriate source for sodium thiopental or making supplies held by the federal government available to the states,\" the letter said. justice department spokeswoman alisa finelli said wednesday that federal officials have received the communication. \"we'll review the letter,\" she said. oregon is one of the 13 states signing the letter and has run out of the execution drug, said spokesman tony green of the oregon department of justice. \"it's pretty straightforward. we don't have a supply of the drug so we're looking for sources for them should we need them,\" green said. oregon, which hasn't had an execution since 1997, doesn't have any lethal injections scheduled, though more than 30 men are on death row, he said. all those cases are in various stages of appeal, he said. the other states signing the letter are alabama, colorado, delaware, florida, idaho, mississippi, missouri, nevada, tennessee, utah, washington and wyoming. texas, which wasn't part of the letter, performs the most executions in the country and is also facing a shortage of the drug, said spokesman jason clark of the texas department of criminal justice. texas has enough sodium thiopental to carry out this month's two scheduled executions, on february 15 and february 22, but the state's stock of the drug will reach its expiration date in march, clark said. texas has executions scheduled in april, may and july, he said. \"the agency is exploring all of its options at this point, including seeking an alternative source of sodium thiopental as well as seeking an alternative drug to use in a lethal injection process,\" clark said. switching to an alternative drug could be done administratively, but switching to a different execution method would require legislative approval, clark said. \"if we were to go to a firing squad, that would be a change in the execution method\" requiring lawmakers' approval, clark said. in their recently filed federal lawsuit, death row convicts are seeking an injunction barring future imports of the drug and removal of supplies of the drug already in possession of state governments. the lawsuit represents inmates in arizona, california and tennessee. the fda continues to allow states to import \"bulk amounts\" of the drug for use in lethal injection without vetting it to ensure it meets regulatory standards, the lawsuit charges. \"the imported thiopental in question has not been listed with fda, was manufactured by foreign companies that have not registered with fda, and was exported by a wholesaler located in the united kingdom,\" says the lawsuit, filed in u.s. district court in the district of columbia. \"fda has not determined whether the thiopental being imported into the united states is safe and effective, whether the imported thiopental is adulterated or whether the imported thiopental is counterfeit,\" the suit says. an fda spokesman declined to comment last week, citing the litigation.\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" The U.S. Justice Department is reviewing a request from 13 states on how to acquire an execution drug no longer made in the United States and

(babycastles launched as a party alongside the blip festival, a showcase of chiptune musicians; this year's festival begins this week in new york.) meanwhile, the patrons of both of these independent communities are in one way or another striving to experience something new -- something that can't be bought in a store, but that is available for anyone to see and hear if they look in the right places. just like indie music, the independent gaming scene is trading in neat, mass-produced convenience for a rough-hewn, playful provocation. \"[at big gaming studios] games have become massive undertakings in which each developer acts like a cog. the budget for games has increased by billions of dollars, and developers don't take as much risk anymore,\" says salahuddin. \"so you see a lot of rehashed games from the same video game engine, like another \"unreal\" clone.\" the independent gaming movement \"is in response to that.\" the implications of babycastles remixing go wider than the music, art and gaming worlds. the hope, says salahuddin, is to build a kind of economy for independent gaming developers outside the large studios, something akin to what supports indie musicians who make much of their money through touring and merchandise. babycastles' other mission is to bring an obscured world of hobbyist game development to a larger audience -- a public that may be jaded with a culture often built on testosterone-fueled first-person shooters, or that tends to roll its eyes at the premise of games altogether. it's a formidable challenge, but, as the gallery's raucous and diverse gatherings prove, one that isn't so hard to beat. still, mixing games with the underground music scene can have its downside too -- some musicians who come to play fall in love with the games in the basement, salahuddin says. \"so bands started missing their sets.\"\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" This article discusses Babycastles, an underground collective and gallery in Brooklyn, New York, dedicated to the concept of the video game arcade.

'i've thought about killing myself many times,' won said in a recent interview at her small apartment in gunpo, just south of seoul. she has two big strikes against her. there are allegations that she was merely a low-level informant whose deeds were inflated by south korean officials eager to make pyongyang look bad, and by reporters digging for a sexy story. additionally, the sexual nature of her crimes carries a stigma in this conservative country. the sexual nature of won jeong-hwa's crimes carries a stigma in conservative south korea . won was imprisoned in 2008 after a court ruled that she posed as an ordinary north korean defector, then used sex to extract secrets from south korean military officers. the media began calling her 'north korea's mata hari' in reference to an exotic dancer from the netherlands who used sex to obtain military secrets during world war i. north korea accused south korea of cooking up a spy scandal to tarnish pyongyang's image and said won was a criminal. after won was released, she was a popular guest on tv talk shows where she spoke about her harsh, elite spy training. she said she disobeyed pyongyang's orders to assassinate two south korean army intelligence officers with poison. she also talked about how she fell in love with a junior army officer - the \"man of my life.\" he was later imprisoned for passing her secrets including a list of north korean defectors even after learning she was a spy. the attention caused south korean media to revisit her case. some reporters questioned the value of her espionage work, and raised suspicions based on testimony by north korean defectors who said they knew won and her family members in the north. won's 2008 court verdict said she was trained at a special operations unit in pyongyang and was a daughter of an agent killed on a spy mission in south korea in 1974. but won's stepfather, kim dong-soon, who came to south korea in 2007, said in an interview that won's biological father was an ordinary laborer who died of a heart attack, and that won was a high school dropout who had nothing to do with special operations forces. won denies kim's allegations. in the verdict and in interviews, it was said that north korea first sent won to south korea in 2001 to take photos of the exteriors of u.s. military installations and to collect south korean newspaper editorials about north korea. people dubious of won's elite status consider that low-level spy work. some defectors who met won before her 2008 arrest say she was often incoherent and unprofessional and could not have been a highly trained spy. 'i believe that she was exploited as an informant. ... she wasn't even worth being called a spy,' said kim yong-hwa, a defector-turned-activist. he said he once rejected won's request to meet with a high-profile north korean defector because she rambled too much. a key debunker of won's espionage record is won herself. she has said in media interviews that she was pressured by prosecutors to provide false testimony, particularly about her use of sex in spy work. 98128 . 67710 . 92346 . 56262 . 78275 . 87600 . 19854 . 128360 . 130080 . 62439 . 152741 . 80640 . 73840 . 79599 . 140928 . 80481 . 81549 . 125992 . life: won jeong-hwa said she once disobeyed pyongyang's orders to assassinate two south korean army intelligence officers with poison. she also said she fell in love with a junior officer in the south korean army . the trial verdict and an investigation by prosecutors said she slept with numerous men, including south korean officers and her boss at an agency where she worked. won said she used sex as a spying tool only once, to steal personnel management-related documents from an army major's home computer. she said she couldn't resist pressure by prosecutors who gave her alcohol and urged her to confess during questioning. they \"manufactured (the story of) my relations with men,\" she said. 'i'm not a mata hari.' prosecutors have dismissed won's claims. south korea has a history of forgiving former spies and assassins, though they are still sometimes ostracized. their careers in the media often depend on whether they were involved in high-profile cases that captured global attention, and whether they followed seoul's propaganda line against the north. won said a prosecutor told her during her questioning that she could make a new start in the south by following in the footsteps of kim hyon-hui, a north korean agent sentenced to death for bombing a south korean jet in 1987, killing all 115 passengers aboard. kim was later pardoned and wrote a best-selling autobiography. she often appears on tv to speak critically of north korea. several other north koreans who once attacked the south now embrace it. previous life: while working undercover for north korea's late dictator kim jong-il, won jeong-hwa would steal sex secret about his rivals in the south . one of the 31 north korean commandos who launched a brazen mission to assassinate south korea's president in 1968 is now a christian pastor who lectures about the north. a north korean crew member of a submarine that ran aground in the south, and who was captured alive after a massive manhunt that left 25 other comrades dead or missing, is a lecturer for the south korean navy. a spy arrested after a deadly shootout in 1995 works for a think tank run by the south's spy agency and wrote a book about his mission. won, on the other hand, feels trapped. no south korean tv station wants her as an expert because of reports that she may not have been an elite spy. finding work unrelated to her past is also impossible, she said, because no one wants to hire an unskilled woman with a criminal espionage record. one of the jobs she gained and quickly lost was at a noodle restaurant. she said a former colleague later told her the boss had been worried she would poison the food. the army officer won fell in love with has been released, but they are no longer in touch. nor is the father of her 12-year-old daughter in the picture: she said he is a south korean businessman she met in china, where she had been assigned to find and repatriate north korean defectors before she was sent to south korea. won said the government assistance she gets was not enough for her to even buy a school uniform for her daughter. a center that helps female ex-inmates gave one to her. many defectors shun her. she said her neighbors once asked that she move, and that her daughter's friends have been told by their parents to stay away from the girl. 'i've told my daughter she should go to an orphanage because she'd be happier living there,' won said, sobbing.

'sleepy hollow': after four years of studies, scientists have finally discovered the cause of a mysterious illness which caused people to fall asleep for days . radiation: scientists say radon, which occurred naturally from uranium in nearby mines, seeped to the surface and poisoned the residents of kalachi . deadly: radon - a colourless, odourless and tasteless gas - is thought to cause lung cancer and has affected around one in five people in kalachi (pictured) radioactive remains: although radiation levels in the mines themselves are not thought to be dangerous, they have left a deadly legacy for the villagers above . professor leonid rikhvanov from the department of geo-ecology and geo-chemistry concluded the local mines were to blame after ruling out a virus or bacteria as the cause. he said: 'the mines left open spaces underground which were slowly filled with water that has risen upwards, driving pockets of gas inside them to the surface. 'the gas has a toxic effect that pushes a person into a dream like state, and the person then falls asleep.' professor rikhavanov and tomsk polytechnic university have carried out thousands of experiments on the area for over four years. they failed to find radon because conventional methods of measuring radiation do not detect it in the air. he added: 'we eliminated viral and bacterial infections but also obtained test results that ruled out the possibility of radiation sickness too. 'we also failed to find any evidence that toxic chemicals were buried in the area as many locals claimed.' initially, medics who examined the dozing villagers found they were suffering from excessive fluid in the brain but could not work out why. desperate measures: local government officials in kalachi (pictured) are now considering plans to move the village entirely . infected: children affected by the mystery illness are so dizzy they can barely stand up by themselves and spend days at a time in bed . nightmare: professor leonid rikhvanov from the department of geo-ecology and geo-chemistry said the 'toxic gas' induces its victims 'into a dream like state' doctor egor korovin, who examined the victims, said: 'in medical terms they are suffering from encephalopathy, a disorder of the brain but the cause is unclear. 'scans have shown that many of the sufferers have excessive accumulation of fluid in their brains.' according to the national cancer institute, radon decays quickly, giving off tiny radioactive particles. when inhaled, these radioactive particles can damage the cells that line the lung. long-term exposure to radon can lead to lung cancer, the only cancer proven to be associated with inhaling radon. there has been a suggestion of increased risk of leukemia associated with radon exposure in adults and children however, the evidence is not conclusive. radon is present in nearly all air. everyone breathes in radon every day, usually at very low levels. however, people who inhale high levels of radon are at an increased risk of developing lung cancer. last summer, 60 people were taken to hospital suffering from the condition which leaves people feeling dizzy, unable to stand, fatigued and with memory problems. children affected by the mystery illness could barely stand up by themselves and spend days at a time in bed. scientists recently stepped up their investigation after locals complained the situation was getting worse. it is thought nearly one in five of kalachi's 600 residents have been affected by the strange sleep disorder. scientists stepped up the investigation recently after locals complained that incidences of the strange sleeping disorder were getting worse, with nearly one in five of the village's 600 residents now affected. they said the fact that some miners remained unaffected because they have built up a natural immunity to radon. alsu shjeladeva, a local resident, said some men from the area had gone down the shaft in one of the mines and detected a sweet smell while down there. the 54-year-old told russia today: 'we are afraid of what lies in store. we're afraid that we may all fall asleep.' ghost town: kalachi's neighbouring town krasnogorsk has been deserted since the closure of the neighbouring uranium mine . terrifying discovery: a russia today film crew found radiation levels at a filled in mine shaft were 16 times higher than normal background levels . top secret: in the soviet era, krasnogorsk was a secret and 'closed' uranium mining town run directly from moscow . another resident igor samusenko, whose son suffers from the condition, said: 'he runs around and then he gets inert, starts staggering. 'when he turns his head his eyes stay fixed at what he was looking at. if you try to wake him it seems the wants to open his eyes but can't. sleepy valley, sleepy hollow, that's what people call us.' lyubov belkova, 60, claims to be the first resident to have fallen asleep in april 2010 and has since suffered seven separate episodes. she was diagnosed with ischemic strokes but then her neighbour began displaying the same symptoms. some have even reported suffering from vivid hallucinations. in september 2014, a russia today film crew reported radiation doses 16 times higher than would be expected from background radiation near the entrance of the abandoned mine. some locals claimed wind and smoke coming from the mines may be responsible for the illness. others claimed toxic waste has been buried in the area.\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" Scientists have discovered that radon gas from nearby Soviet-era uranium mines is the cause of mysterious sleeping disorders in residents of the remote Kazakhstan village of Kalachi.

luscious of fruits is back and — thanks to this year’s weather — yields are nearly treble those of 2012. the cherry-growing harvest is expected to be worth £20 million, up from just £7.5 million last year, and the season is set to last longer than ever, well into september. ‘last year we picked 100 tonnes. this year we expect to pick 250,’ says sarah neaves, a third generation cherry farmer from kent. the greatest cherry harvest ever? trees are leaning over, drooping beneath the weight of their deep red fruit and pickers are working throughout the day in kent and herefordshire . ‘this season has been great for us due . to the dry weather and plenty of light, but we also had a very cold . winter, which cherry trees like because they can hibernate.’ cold . and frosty weather allows the trees to ‘shut down’ and build reserves . of energy for blossoming and fruit. it also kills pests and fungus that . can wreck harvests. sarah . leads me along a neat line of cherry trees being harvested on her . family’s farm near sittingbourne. the neaves’ orchards are planted in . small, hedgerow-lined fields, with tall poplars acting as windbreaks. dry weather and plenty of light after a cold spell are ideal conditions as cherry trees can hibernate in winter . at one end are the beehives, home to the all-important pollinators. on every tree, perfectly firm and shiny cherries in varying shades of crimson are decadently large. each bunch, the size of a man’s hand, must weigh a pound. and between the glossy dark leaves, there are at least one hundred bunches on every tree. the pickers, wearing traditional leather-belted wicker baskets around their hips, bury themselves among the leaves to get to the fruit. ‘we only pick fruit that has reached . the right shade — the colour tells you how ripe the fruit is,’ says . sarah. ‘cherries continue to ripen after picking, but only a little, so . it’s important to pick them when they are perfect.’ seven years ago, the neaves’ farm had 30 acres of old cherry trees, but they mainly grew apples and pears. cherry farming had dramatically declined. where there had been 5,000 hectares of cherry orchards in kent at the beginning of the 20th  century, by the end there were just 600. ‘the fruit was small and the quality low. the supermarkets were buying cheap fruit from france,’ says sarah. after we joined the common market, british fruit growers, who did not get an agricultural subsidy, found they could not compete with cheaper imports. thousands of acres of cherry orchards were destroyed. a cherry picker at work. sarah neaves, also a cherry farmer, from kent, says: 'i think the most fantastic thing is how beautiful these trees are. i just love to come to work every day' (picture posed by model) supermarkets used to

. the crusading food lovers britain movement, farmers looked again at . cherry farming. richard harnden, director of research for berry gardens . growers, says that the old way of farming cherries had to go. we needed . to adopt the practices of french, german and belgian growers in order to . compete. ‘in kent’s orchards, we grew huge trees, so long wooden ladders were needed for picking,’ he says. ‘it was picturesque, but it was just not practical. with today’s health and safety considerations, pruning and picking would be impossible.’ the trees in the neaves’ new orchards are small. just before they blossom, they are enclosed by metal frames covered with rain-proof plastic and netting at the sides to protect the fruit from its great enemy — birds. helen green, pictured, led the cherry aid campaign which energised farmers to look at cherry farming again . the gisela dwarf rootstock that the neaves planted in 2006 is german: the bushy, high-yielding trees can be easily picked and covered for protection in the growing season. their farm, little sharsted, is no longer little with 85 acres planted with cherries. the family has grown fruit there for more than 50 years. sarah’s grandfather archie took on the farm, and her father brian followed him. sarah, 46, went into insurance when she left school, but came back to the farm at the age of 23. she runs it with her brother edward and farm manager william dixon. they work with eight other farms in kent, herefordshire and scotland, growing fruit for supermarkets. an old barn is now a packing plant. they employ some locals, but most of the 60 pickers and packers are students from lithuania, bulgaria and romania. the conditions in which they live and work, their pay and hours are bound by ethical audits. many return season after season. the new british cherry is very different to the fruit you used to see being sold by the side of the road or in markets in the towns and cities. during a short season in july, you could . pick up a brown paper bag of small, firm, bright red cherries weighed . out by the pound. they were a real treat. when i was a little girl, my . friends and i would hang pairs of cherries from our ears as pretend . earrings. it was the seventies and our mothers would never have allowed . us to get our ears pierced, so the seasonal summer cherry served as a . delightful — and edible — substitute. the fruit we loved then are now . heritage varieties, which originated from the wild mazzard or gean tree, . which grew up to 75 ft high (you can only imagine the health and safety . issues involved in picking them). varieties . derived from these ancient trees include the romantically named merton . heart, roundel heart, florence and waterloo. today, few of these are in . commercial production, but some survive in old kitchen gardens and . ancient orchards. the new british cherry is different to the fruit once sold by the side of the road or in markets in the towns and cities . unusual among these are the white frogmore, one of the earliest cherries of the traditional season, or the gorgeous, orangey red, golden fleshed napoleon. sour cherries still grow in old orchards — black varieties such as morello or the kentish red. merchant is an early heritage variety still grown in kent, grafted onto the super-efficient gisela stock. but most of the big sellers are modern fruits, with kordia being the favourite. big, deep ruby red and full of sweet juice, it tastes amazing. my only criticism is that it is too large to fit in my old-fashioned cherry stoning gadget. so these magnificent fruit have to be pitted by hand before i can make jam and puddings. all this abundance shows british cherries have fought back to become a prominent crop. ‘as the trees

bill after a border security deal was announced this week, but house gop opposition to immigration legislation remains the biggest roadblock to a bill getting to the president's desk, and that opposition only appears to be hardening. senate immigration deal includes tougher border security . the messy demise of the farm bill on the house floor on thursday demonstrated the divisions within gop ranks and the willingness of dozens of rank-and-file members to ignore their leadership.  while there's not a clear parallel between that bill's failure and the road ahead for immigration reform, the episode does underline the exceedingly tough task house speaker john boehner, r-ohio, faces as he attempts to guide immigration legislation through the house. boehner insists he wants to tackle immigration reform, but hasn't been clear about how he intends to navigate the controversial issue through his own conference. cnn poll: big generational divide in immigration battle . \"after all this talk about the senate there has been so little focus on the house and that it has been, pre-farm vote -- and will continue to be post-farm vote -- the choke point for any immigration reform, \" amy walter, national editor of the cook political report told cnn. house gop leaders knew many conservatives would vote against the farm bill because they viewed the food-stamp programs as too expensive.  but 62 members, roughly a quarter of all house republicans, broke with boehner, who made a rare endorsement of the bill, and joined with the vast majority of house democrats to take down the bill.  even if democrats produced the level of support republicans say they anticipated, gop leaders still didn't have support within their own ranks to get the farm bill through. the farm bill's defeat \"exposed the vulnerabilities of so called compromise legislation in the house,\" walter added. but even before the farm bill fiasco boehner began pouring cold water on the immigration momentum coming out of the senate.  as news was breaking on the senate deal on thursday morning boehner compared immigration reform to obamacare, the bill republicans constantly malign as the prime example of government overreach. \"every day as obamacare is being implemented, americans are reminded of what happens when you have big legislation rammed through congress with minimum support,\" boehner said at his weekly news conference.  \"americans' confidence in their government is near an all-time low, so if immigration reform is going to work it's essential that we have the confidence of the american people and that it's done the right way,\" the speaker added. the deliberate move to put immigration in the same category as obamacare showed boehner is in no mood to muscle through a massive immigration overhaul unless it can garner significant votes from both sides of the aisle -- a tall order in the house. boehner didn't comment directly on the new \"border surge\" provisions that would double the number of agents on the u.s.-mexico border or the new money to construct a 700-mile-long fence.  but he raised questions on whether that plan would be enough to address concerns among conservatives, saying, \"if we're going to get the kind of bipartisan support i think we need, and we're not going to get that confidence unless the american people look up and say, 'yes, this border security package meets the straight-face test.' \" another key house gop player on immigration reform, judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte, r-virginia, was skeptical that the senate's border security plan was going to work, telling reporters, \"just throwing bodies at it\" does not solve the problem. goodlatte said the larger issue is addressing the 35%-45% of the 11 million people in the u.s. without legal status who he says enter the country lawfully -- through visas, but are allowed to overstay or gain a waiver to remain.  he argued there has to be a bigger emphasis on interior enforcement programs.  and goodlatte repeated his intention to move immigration reform through a \"step by step\" process instead of the sort of comprehensive bill the senate is considering. navarrette: border security push is a joke . \"anything attached to a path to citizenship even if it secures the border i wouldn't support it,\" pennsylvania republican rep. lou barletta said when asked by cnn about the senate's new border security plan.  barletta said he could support additional resources but said he wanted \"a guarantee\" that enforcement measures in fact worked, and he thought what the senate was doing would end up speeding up eventual citizenship for undocumented workers, something he said was unacceptable. \"i don't have any confidence that it's ever going to be implemented, \" iowa republican rep. steve king told cnn when asked about the senate border security plan, saying he didn't believe secretary of homeland security janet napolitano would follow the law. the dynamic inside the house republican conference on immigration could be seen outside the capitol on wednesday afternoon with two groups delivering polar opposite messages about immigration policy. house gop conference chair cathy mcmorris rogers, r-washington, held a news conference with several house republicans and a group of hispanic religious leaders and stressed the party's outreach efforts to latinos on immigration.  just yards away, the loud voices of a hundreds of activists opposed to a path to citizenship -- branded \"amnesty\" -- could be heard at an event king organized. boehner already made it clear earlier in the week that he would only move an immigration bill if it had the support of the majority of house republicans.  but even if he gets more than half of the 234 house gop members, he'll still needs to rely on house democratic leader nancy pelosi to get most of her members on board to pass a bill. democratic support for immigration reform has never been in question.  but house republican congressional aides, still incensed about the failure of the farm bill, question whether democrats on capitol hill are more focused on scoring political points in the next election than joining with them to pass a bill. \"how are we supposed to trust a promise or a whip count from house democrats now?\" one senior house gop leadership aide said when asked about what the farm bill's defeat means on immigration. walter noted that all along many republicans on the hill have been suspicious about how serious congressional democrats were about actually getting an immigration bill over the finish line. \"it speaks to this deep seeded belief among many republicans that democrats are going to pull the rug out from them and use it to beat them about the head in 2014,\" walter explained to cnn. the senate could be on track to pass its immigration package before july 4, but the bipartisan group in the house that has been working for months on a similar proposal hasn't been able to finalize their deal yet. the house judiciary committee has begun working on more narrow proposals aimed at enforcement and security, and those could come up for votes as early as next month. even those in the house who are pressing for major immigration reform say it's unlikely to play out in the house until later this fall. but that schedule poses difficult decisions for boehner about how to move immigration as it comes around the same time as the house has to deal with an equally divisive issue -- addressing how to deal with the country's debt limit. biden urges final push on immigration reform .\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" The article discusses the potential for a comprehensive immigration reform bill to pass in the Senate, but highlights

'i am going to disappoint you by not now drawing great red lines,\" he told the bbc radio 4 today programme. 'are there die-in-the-ditch issues which i have highlighted in the past which i care about, frankly, even more than this? yes. i think fairer taxes is something i've campaigned for. 'that is something i care about much more than the precise mechanics of when a referendum is held.' mr clegg said that past history suggested there would be changes to the eu treaties which would require a referendum in the uk under legislation passed by the coalition. 'i have always felt that you have a referendum when the time is right, when something happens which merits that referendum,\" he said. 'if you look back at the development of the european community, and subsequently the european union, every few years the rules of the game - these cumbersome treaties - are changed and new decision-making authority is pooled at european level. 'so i think, if history is any guide, it's more than likely to happen again. at that point there should be a referendum, we've guaranteed that in law.'\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, admitted his shame for setting fire to a collection of rare cacti as a teenager during a school trip to Germany in 1983.

'they examined it, they weighed it, they said you have to fill out this form,' his father, also named jon, told the associated press in a phone interview on tuesday, december 11. but when hammar and his friend crossed the border and handed the paperwork to mexican officials, they impounded the rv and jailed the two men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun - which they deemed to be an inch too short. hammar's friend was later released because the gun did not belong to him. the hammar family's attorney eddie varon-levy said mexican law prohibits civilians from carrying certain types of guns, like sawed-off shotguns, which can be more easily concealed. mexican law prohibits shotguns with a barrel of less than 25 inches. varon-levy said . mexican officials measured the barrel on hammar's shotgun as 24 inches and that it has not been sawed off. family members said the gun was . purchased at sears and blamed u.s. officials for telling hammar he could . bring it across the border in the first place. hero: hammar was a combat veteran who had been treated for ptsd just before his arrest in mexico . distraught family: hammar's parents jon and olivia hammar, are now fighting for their son's safe return from mexico . varon-levy also questioned the way mexican officials measured the gun, because the measurements can differ depending on where they are taken on the barrel. he said dealing with mexican authorities has also been difficult. he said hammar was brought to court a few weeks ago, where officials tried to convince him to plead guilty without a lawyer present. varon-levy said he didn't show up because he was told there was a continuance. 'i am fuming,' he said. hammar could face 12 years in prison, but varon-levy said that is unlikely. he wants to get the charges downgraded, in hopes that hammar can plead guilty to a lesser charge of carrying an unregistered weapon, which carries only a fine. hammar served in iraq and afghanistan before being honorably discharged from the marines in 2007. his mother said surfing helped him cope after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. hammar developed ptsd following the death of a fellow marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet . when the two served together in fallujah, iraq. he had just completed . treatment at a center for veterans in california last year, . before getting detained during his misadventure in matamoros. weapon in question: hammar had his great-grandfather's antique rifle inspected at the border, but he was arrested for carrying it anyway . ricardo alday, spokesman for the mexican embassy, said in a statement: 'mexican authorities have fully guaranteed his right to consular assistance; therefore mr hammar has been in contact with u.s. consular officers in mexico who have regularly visited him. 'the possession of any weapon restricted for the use of the army in mexico is a federal crime, regardless of whether you declare it or not upon entering the country, and must be automatically prosecuted.' alday said harmmar has the right to defense counsel and a fair trial 'as any other detainee facing criminal charges. 'in addition, his life and integrity are protected by national and international laws.' in danger: hammar is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters . still, hammar is being held in one of the most dangerous areas in mexico. matamoros is the active headquarters of the gulf cartel, which has been fighting with its former running drug routes along the eastern end of the texas-mexico border. a fight among inmates at the prison in october 2011 left 20 dead and 12 injured. when first arrested hammar was held with the prison's general population, which is filled mostly with members of drug cartels. now, the 27-year-old marine veteran is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters, according to his father. the two occasionally speak to one another over the phone. 'sometimes he's got his head on good. we're like just, \"hang in there. we're doing everything we can,\"' said jon hammar senior, a 48-year-old software engineer. 'other days, it's like, it's not as good,' in august, the family received a frightening middle of the night phone call from the cartel demanding money, jon hammar senior said. '\"lady, this isn't about the police. this is our house. we have your son. we're going to kill him if you don't send us money,\"' jon hammar senior said, recounting the phone call. the couple planned to wire the money to an account, but officials at the u.s. consulate intervened and contacted prison officials. his son was moved into a private cell the next day, he said. peter velasco, a spokesman for the state department, said officials have visited hammar three times, spoken with him by phone and contacted prison officials to stop them from chaining him to the bed. 'the safety and well-being of u.s. citizens is something we take very seriously,' said velasco. u.s. senator bill nelson, a florida democrat, spoke on the senate floor tuesday, december 11, asking mexican authorities to release hammar. jailed: hammar was taken into custody right after crossing the border from brownsivlle, texas, and is now being held at a prison in matamoros . u.s. rep ileana ros-lehtinen, of florida, said: 'this is just an outrageous case.' she was contacted by hammar's mother olivia, who asked the republican congresswoman for help. she added: 'if the parents had not told me about it, and his friends had not gotten involved, i would say that it was just not possible for someone to be in so much trouble for doing the right thing.' ros-lehtinen also urged the state department to work incessantly to reunite hammar with his family and said she's disappointed the agency has not told her what efforts have been made. the miami republican said she plans to contact the department of homeland security and customs and border patrol about hammar's arrest. 'the hammar family has suffered a great deal since their son's unjust incarceration in august and the details they have provided to my office are gripping and a clear abuse of jon's human rights,' she said in a statement. supporters set up a facebook page free jon hammar, which now has over 6,500 supporters. watch video here .\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" The first photo of marine veteran Jon Hammar, held captive in one of Mexico's most infamous prisons for four months, has been released to the public.

home away from home, eagle, the lunar module that transported neil armstrong and me to the bleak, crater-pocked moonscape. standing there and soaking in the view, i called it as i saw it: \"magnificent desolation.\" as neil and i walked upon the surface of the moon at tranquility base, we satisfied a vision held by humankind for centuries. and as inscribed on the plaque fastened to the ladder of our lander: \"we came in peace for all mankind.\" sunday will mark the 45th anniversary of the lunar landing, when neil announced, \"tranquility base here. the eagle has landed.\" it was, truly, one small step, but more steps are needed to fuel and assure america's leadership role in deep space exploration. i'm often asked just how lonely it was on the moon. first of all, what got us there was the tireless effort of some 400,000 people who shared a universal dream. project apollo was a unified enterprise that relied on teamwork. second, while we were farther away from terra firma than any humans had ever ventured -- with our colleague mike collins circling the moon in the command module above us -- the three of us were connected to home planet earth. close to a billion people watched and listened to our journey. in reflecting back on that thrilling, transformative time, several things come to mind. standing on that harsh, desolate, yet magnificent terrain, stealing precious moments, i looked back at earth. everything i knew and loved lay suspended on a far away and fragile blue sphere that was engulfed by the blackness of space. in the back of my mind were neil's words about a step on the moon. imagine the great magnificence of humanity going from horse and buggy, to railroads, cars, and airplanes, to rockets -- and now walking on the moon. that is a testimonial to the progress of the creatures here on earth. i couldn't have imagined anything more desolate -- knowing it hadn't changed in hundreds of thousands of years. you couldn't find any place like that on earth. the airlessness. brilliant sunlight illuminated the dust, which was everywhere. and the horizon, visibly curving away in the distance, was so clear because no pollution obscured it. walking across that landscape was much easier than we had thought it would be. when my boot struck moon dust, it flew away in a straight line, a sign of the lighter gravity load, one-sixth that of earth. i didn't anticipate, returning to earth, that america's triumph was viewed as a success for all humankind. people expressed their collective pride by declaring \"we did it!\" -- there was an aura of ownership of the achievement. although we can revel in taking rear-view mirror looks at the apollo 11 mission, the urgent need, i believe, is to confront the future. our space program should not focus on getting back to the moon. we have already blazed that trail. apollo was part of a clear, get-there-in-a-hurry, space race strategy. to be blunt, that meant we didn't spend time developing re-usability. it's time for commercial and international interests to move, beyond discovery, to development. other nations, china in particular, are working toward the exploration and development of the moon with robots and, eventually, crews. providing u.s. support for international lunar development is in our best interest. by participating in a unified, international effort, we avoid an unnecessary race back to the moon and can still participate in lunar science. other u.s. government entities -- the national science foundation and commercial entities -- should take over in moon exploitation and development. it may well be that nasa is not best suited to run this program. exploitation has never been its strong point. it's true, multiple choices need to be made. we could as a country sit around and do nothing. on the other hand, we could accept the role of space leadership that we carved out for ourselves in the 1960s and 1970s. for america, another destination is calling. america's longer-term goal should be permanent human presence on mars. the moment to begin could be on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of apollo 11's touchdown on the moon. we can make a courageous, kennedyesque commitment to america's future in deep space. the u.s. president could utter these momentous words: \"i believe this nation should commit itself, within two decades, to commencing an america-led, permanent presence on the planet mars.\" we must look to re-establish realistic, but ambitious, longer range and more meaningful exploration goals, and we must issue a call -- with the right guidance and sustained funding -- to a new generation. the next generation of space explorers. again, the apollo moon program provided one small step. other steps lay ahead, strides

'it's really more to weaken a title on a label that we've worked very hard for,' said jeff arnett, the master distiller at the jack daniel's distillery in lynchburg, tenn. 'as a state, i don't think tennessee should be bashful about being protective of tennessee whiskey over say bourbon or scotch or any of the other products that we compete with.' republican state rep. bill sanderson emphasized that his bill wouldn't do away with last year's law enacted largely on the behest of jack daniel's corporate parent, louisville, ky.,-based brown-forman corp. the principal change would be to allow tennessee whiskey makers to reuse barrels, which he said would present considerable savings over new ones that can cost $600 each. 'there are a lot of ways to make high-quality whiskey, even if it's not necessarily the way jack daniel's does it,' sanderson said. 'what gives them the right to call theirs tennessee whiskey, and not others?' sanderson acknowledged that he introduced the measure at diageo's urging, but said it would also help micro distilleries opening across the state. diageo picked up on the same theme. 'this isn't about diageo, as all of our tennessee whiskey is made with new oak,' said diageo executive vice president guy l. smith iv. 'this is about brown-forman trying to stifle competition and the entrepreneurial spirit of micro distillers. 'we are not sure what they are afraid of, as we feel new innovative products from a new breed of distillers is healthy for the entire industry,' he said. special blend: jeff arnett, the master distiller at the jack daniel distillery in lynchburg, tennessee tests the aroma of whiskey at the distillery. jack daniel's is fighting efforts in the state legislature to dial back the legal definition of tennessee whiskey, including a provision that requires the spirit to be aged in new oak barrels . jack daniel's last year sold 11.5 million cases of it black label last year, a 5 percent increase from 2012. dickel, the second-largest tennessee whiskey producer, sold 130,000 cases in 2013. the standards and special branding of tennessee whiskey are an outgrowth of the special designation granted long ago to bourbon. a half-century ago, congress declared bourbon a distinctive product of the united states. by law, bourbon must be made of a grain mix of at least 51 percent corn, distilled at less than 160 proof, have no additives except water to reduce the proof and be aged in new, charred white oak barrels. spirits that don't follow those guidelines can't be sold as bourbon. one example is brown-forman's own early times, which is marketed as a 'kentucky whisky' because it is made in reused barrels. billy kaufman, the president short mountain distillery in woodbury, tenn., said it is more difficult to distinguish spirits not meeting the tennessee standard. 'if i made whiskey in tennessee in a used barrel, what it would be called then?' he said. 'whiskey, made in tennessee?' david mcmahan, a lobbyist representing dickel and popcorn sutton distilling, said the law passed last year would require all tennessee whiskies to taste like jack daniel's. preparing to fight: a law that was introduced last year says the whiskey must be made in a way that resembles almost to the letter the process used to make jack daniel's . 'it's not unlike if the beer guys 25 years ago had said all american beer has to be made like budweiser,' mcmahan said. 'you never would have a sam adams or a yazoo or any of those guys.' but tennessee craft distillers are divided about the state law. charles nelson, the ceo of nelson's green brier distillery in nashville, said he supports tighter regulation. 'holding ourselves to a higher standard will ultimately be better for all the people in the category,' he said. 'if we lower the standards, it could lead to more products and brands that could lower the reputation of tennessee whiskey.' whiskey is clear when it goes into the barrel. it's during the aging process that the whiskey acquires color and flavors. jack daniel's arnett said other distillers reusing barrels might resort to using artificial colorings and flavorings that wouldn't match the quality of the whiskey stored in new barrels. 'we've been making whiskey a long time, and we know that would not uphold the quality that people expect from tennessee whiskey,' he said. 'so we wouldn't dare consider doing it, even though it would save us millions of dollars every year.' change in the law? lawmakers are looking at amending that law so that some of the craft distillers that have sprung up in recent years can label their products tennessee whiskey, a distinctive and popular draw in the booming american liquor business. the people behind jack daniel's see the hand of a bigger rival at work, however, the foreign-owned conglomerate that makes george dickel, another famed tennessee brand . jack daniel's stores its whiskey in new barrels made at a brown-forman plant. sanderson argues that the flavor and color of the whiskey is determined more by the charring of the inside of the barrels, which he said is a process that can be repeated. consumers would ultimately decide whether the end product matches up. 'if they're making an inferior product, the market will decide,' he said.\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" The article discusses a year-old law that requires Tennessee whiskey to be made from mash of at least 51% corn, aged in new charred oak barrels, filtered through maple charcoal, and bottled at a minimum of 80 proof.

'and i remind him, when it comes to housing benefit, under his side housing benefit pretty near doubled in ten years and it was set to rise far more than it'll rise under us.' mr byrne said the housing benefit bill was set to rise by 'an extraordinary' £4billion over the course of four years. he said: 'now what we do not want on top of that is another bill for council tax payers to clean up the cost of homelessness. the issue began to trend on twitter this morning with many explaining their exasperation over the level being set at £26,000 .

'people on benefits should face the same choices as working families, including where they can afford to live,' he said. the cap was welcomed by the centre for social justice think tank, which was founded by mr duncan smith in opposition. executive director gavin poole said: 'members of the house of lords should think twice about opposing a reform that will help tackle child poverty in the uk. 'our present system traps families in dependency on state handouts and sends a corrosive message to the two million children who live in workless households. 'deprived of the role model of a parent who goes out to work and earns a living, many of these children will simply repeat this stultifying, destructive cycle, graduating to an adult life on benefits.

took over news corp.'s british newspaper publishing arm, he said. he agreed with a suggestion that the reason was because they knew he would put a stop to it. \"i think that must be it, that i would say, 'cut out the cancer,' and there was some desire to not do that,\" he told the leveson inquiry into press ethics. former murdoch employees testified earlier that they told him about the problem. he was testifying before an independent british inquiry into journalistic ethics prompted by phone hacking at the defunct news of the world, once the flagship british sunday tabloid of news corp. the scandal has reverberated through the british political establishment, led to dozens of arrests on suspicion of criminal activity and forced news corp. to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking. tuesday's hearing revealed the depth of the links between the murdoch family and british politicians, with murdoch saying he had had drinks with david cameron at a pub before cameron became prime minister and dined with him once he was in office. leveson inquiry lawyer robert jay pressed murdoch over the extent of his contact with politicians as the company moved to take full control of satellite broadcaster bskyb, a bid that collapsed because of the phone-hacking scandal. evidence published tuesday suggests that news corp. was getting inside information from the government minister with the power to approve or block the acquisition, culture secretary jeremy hunt. hundreds of pages of e-mails painted a picture of a back channel between hunt's office and frederic michel, a top murdoch employee. michel told murdoch in january 2011 that he had gotten \"absolutely illegal\" information about government plans related to the takeover plan, the e-mails show. prime minister cameron has full confidence in hunt, his spokesman craig oliver told cnn after the murdoch testimony concluded. hunt's portfolio includes the london olympics, which are now less than 100 days away. james murdoch and his father, rupert murdoch, have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them. rupert murdoch is scheduled to appear wednesday and perhaps thursday morning at the inquiry. the younger murdoch has already been called twice to testify before british lawmakers and resigned from a number of top management positions at british subsidiaries of his father's media empire. he and his father have always denied knowing about the scale of phone hacking, which police say could have affected thousands of people, ranging from celebrities and politicians to crime victims and war veterans. james murdoch said tuesday that he had no reason to look into illegal eavesdropping by his employees when he took over the company's british newspaper subsidiary in december 2007. a news of the world reporter and a private investigator had been sent to prison that year for hacking the phones of the staff of princes william and harry, but murdoch said he had been assured that the problem went no further. \"i was not told sufficient information to go and turn over a whole bunch of stones that i was told had already been turned over,\" he said. \"i don't think that, short of knowing they weren't giving me the full picture, i would've been able to know that at the time.\" the journalist who went to prison, clive goodman, had been saying that phone-hacking went beyond his case, leveson inquiry counsel robert jay said. \"i was not aware of that,\" murdoch replied. he told the leveson inquiry on tuesday that he did not decide what went into the company's british tabloids, the sun and the news of the world, relying on his editors to make the decisions. he was also pressed on his relationship with british politicians, including former prime minister tony blair and the current leader, cameron. he acknowledged meeting with them, but denied having lobbied them improperly about his family's business interests. and he denied having made a \"crass calculation\" about how the sun's endorsement of cameron's conservative party before the 2010 elections would affect news corp. dozens of people have been arrested in criminal investigations into phone and e-mail hacking and police bribery, and police asked prosecutors last week to charge at least eight people. the suspects include at least one journalist and a police officer, the crown prosecution service said, declining to name them. no charges have been filed, and the crown prosecution service said it did not know when a decision would be made about charges. the british government set up the leveson inquiry, the independent investigation that summoned the murdochs, in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. two parliamentary committees also are looking into media conduct. james murdoch, 39, resigned as chairman of british sky broadcasting this month, saying, \"i am determined that the interests of bskyb should not be undermined by matters outside the scope of this company.\" rupert murdoch testified before lawmakers in july alongside his son. news corp. shut down its british sunday tabloid, the news

phone-hacking victims was in new york last week, exploring options for a u.s. case against the company. attorney mark lewis said he is representing three or four new clients, one of whom is believed to be a u.s. citizen, who say their phones were hacked while they were on u.s. soil. there are also many other potential new clients, lewis said. \"as i've been traveling here,\" he said, \"i've been contacted by many people who've had, so they say, similar problems -- not just hacking but maybe being trailed or have fallen out with some american murdoch news corp. company and then found

'the majority of staff are female and, as a responsible employer, the council agreed to provide transport from november until march at the beginning and end of the day.

'employers should encourage staff to take responsibility for their safety.

the debate over female bishops started soon after women were ordained as priests 20 years ago. the cofe set up the committees and inquiries that led to yesterday’s vote in 2000. what went on before? the vote in the general synod that was meant to finally approve women bishops ended in narrow defeat for reformers in november 2012. who is opposed? anglo-catholics, who believe the bible and tradition do not allow women bishops, and conservative evangelicals, who believe the bible says women should not be church leaders. what is different now? in 2012, it was felt there were too few provisions for those opposed to female bishops. but church leaders have now drawn up a new compromise, including a dispute procedure. how does the new plan work? the cofe has laid out principles saying that women shall have the full powers of male bishops and that everyone must recognise the decision. all dioceses, even those dominated by traditionalists, must include a junior bishop who will ordain and promote women. but it recognises that opponents of women bishops have the right to ‘flourish’ – so there must be ‘pastoral and sacramental provision’ for disputes. what about disputes? church councils which oppose the move can send their bishop a resolution stating that they do not want a woman vicar or clergy, nor any male priests who have been ordained by women bishops. they should then be sent male clergy when jobs become vacant. if an objecting parish is in a diocese run by a woman bishop, she will allow it to be supervised by a male junior bishop. if no junior bishop is available within the diocese, one can be brought in from outside. what if there are still arguments? there will be an appeals system, in which parishes can turn to an ‘independent reviewer’. but if a parish does not accept an appeal decision they can be subject to disciplinary action, which can culminate in dismissal from the church. sally barnes, pictured right, is overwhelmed with emotion beside hilary cotton after the synod in york . the first appointment may be seen as an anti-climax, with a woman picked to fill a junior post, subordinate to a male bishop. after . the vote, the archbishop of york led the general synod in a rendition . of we are marching in the light of god, with members clapping along, . some even shedding tears of joy. reverend . dr rosemarie mallett, from southwark diocese, said yesterday: ‘i’m . absolutely joyful, thank god after 20 years of very hard work we now . have a decision that can help us work for everyone in the church. yesterday’s vote came nearly 20 months after the church’s last attempt to approve a law allowing women bishops. the lost synod vote in november 2012 left the then archbishop of canterbury, rowan williams, humiliated and apparently with little hope of reviving the cause for several years. but a new compromise, which allows scope for traditionalists to challenge the appointment of a female bishop in their parish, was brought to the vote in record time. the plan is based on the hope of compromise between opposing liberals and conservatives. archbishop welby said cofe members must ‘continue to demonstrate love for those who disagree on theological grounds’. he added: ‘as delighted as i am for the outcome of this vote i am also mindful of those within the church for whom the result will be difficult and a cause of sorrow.’ during the debate, guildford traditionalist adrian vincent said he would reverse his position from 2012 and vote in favour. ‘by doing so, i am betraying what i believe, i am betraying those who trusted in me,’ he said. ‘i hope that the promised commitment to mutual flourishing is not a commitment that will run out of steam in a few years.’ but opponent dr chik kaw tan, of lichfield, said: ‘men and women are equal but their roles are not interchangeable ... if we allow the church to be guided by secular thinking our teaching will soon unravel.’ in 2012, the house of laity voted just six short of the necessary two to one majority. yesterday, it voted 152 to 45 for women bishops. members of the clergy arrive for the general synod of church of england meeting at the university of york . the archbishop of canterbury arrived for the general synod of church of england meeting at the university of york today . deputy prime minister nick clegg welcomed the 'watershed moment' for the church of england, after the synod overwhelmingly backed the measure to scrap the ban . more than two thirds of the members of the church of england's synod, pictured here during morning prayers this morning, voted for the consecration of women bishops . the most rev justin welby said the church had been wrong on women bishops 'theologically' for centuries . the archbishop of canterbury said he would be 'delighted' to see a woman take his role in his lifetime .\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" The Church of England has voted to allow women to become bishops, ending 14 years of debate and division.

requiring students (and teachers, for that matter) to stay in school for more days is complicated and must overcome at least two significant obstacles. first, more days of school usually carries a price tag to cover costs of additional staff time, transportation and keeping buildings running. second, although public attitudes are changing, overhauling such an ingrained institution as the long summer break won't be accomplished easily. the response to the first issue is to weigh the long-term costs of the summer break against the short-term costs of a longer school year. balsz elementary school district in phoenix, for example, has extended its school year to 200 days, paying teachers 9% more to work the additional days. since the longer year has been implemented, proficiency rates on state tests have risen, failure rates have fallen, and the achievement gap is disappearing. clearly, the relatively small increase in budget yields large dividends for the students who attend. students graduating middle school proficient in algebra and reading have opportunities open to them that are simply nonexistent for students at risk of  failure. then consider the brooklyn generation school in new york, which has developed a model in which the students in grades nine through 12 attend for 200 days, but the teachers, on staggered schedules, are there for only 180. that means they earn salaries equal to their peers throughout the city. there is no shortage of innovation that can bring the benefits of a longer year to students. and what of the idea that summer should be a time of respite from the stresses of school? there are two wrong notions wrapped up in this perspective. the first is that somehow summer is automatically a magical time for children. such may be the case for children from middle- and upper-class homes, but for those whose families can't afford camp or other activities, summer is often a time of emptiness and tedium. as one balsz fifth-grader, happy to be back at school in august, declared, \"sometimes summer is really boring. we just sit there and watch tv.\" the second, more significant, misperception is that school is automatically bereft of the excitement and joy of learning. on the contrary, as the national center on time and learning describes in its studies of schools that operate with significantly more time, educators use the longer days and years to enhance the content and methods of the classroom. it provides more openings for hands-on learning, student collaboration and inquiry-based learning, where students push themselves to learn. why shouldn't children have these same opportunities during the summer as they do in cooler months? it is true that just having more time, whether it's more days during the year or more hours during the day, does not guarantee a superior education. educators must use that extra time well and be committed to addressing individual students' needs and not waver in their drive for excellence. yet, we do know that teachers who lack sufficient time with students, and students who spend too much time away from productive learning, are fighting an uphill battle in an environment where we hold increasingly high expectations for our children. there is no reason to scale back these expectations. our future as a nation depends upon having a well-informed, highly skilled work force and citizenry. we should expect our schools to furnish today's students with the education they will need to excel in our global society. but we must also be willing to provide schools the tools they need to ensure this outcome, including the flexibility to turn the lazy days of summer into the season of learning. follow @cnnopinion on twitter .\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" The article discusses the negative effects of the long summer break on children from low-income families, particularly in terms of the \"summer slide\" where they lose academic progress made during the school year. The author suggests that extending the school year or implementing longer school days could help address this issue. They also argue that the idea that summer should be a time of respite from school is misguided, as it can be boring and uneventful for children from low-income families. Instead, they propose that educators should use the extra time during the summer to enhance learning and address individual students' needs."}

but something is wrong with our relationship. and i know it's not my iphone, it's idean. yes, i know this isn't the best time to bring this up, what with apple's earnings report showing that so many others are also falling out of love with their iphones. but i could not keep it inside any longer. i realized our problems had gotten bad when reading media reports about the new iphone 5 expected to be released this fall. in the past, those articles truly excited me. i couldn't wait for the new iphone. i would scour the net looking for more hints. an image. a rumor. anything. in those days, i was crazy about the iphone. but when i read about the iphone 5, my reaction was not one of excitement, but pity. the iphone is doing all it can to stay attractive. lose weight. increase its screen size. work faster. it's like the phone version of madonna. maybe the iphone caught me looking at the younger samsung galaxy. i tried not to look. but how can i be blamed for taking a glance? so, i googled an image. and yes, i asked a friend if i could try his. but i haven't done anything wrongâ€”at least that's what i keep telling myself. cnnmoney.com: apple badly misses forecasts . i longingly think back to how my relationship started with the iphone. it was the summer, 2007. i thought it would be a typical summer. i'd use my phone to make some calls, text friends from it. nothing exciting. but then i saw it. sure, i had seen the commercials, but i didn't fully appreciate the beauty of the iphone until i saw it in person. at that moment, i vowed that nothing would stand in my way of getting my hands on one--except the hundreds of people standing on line in front of me at the apple store. my first iphone had me at \"hello.\" actually, there were a lot of dropped calls in those days, so technically it had me at: \"can you hear me now?\" but hey, we were young. neither of us knew what we were doing or where it would lead. but we agreed to give it a shotâ€”a one-year shot, to be precise, per the terms of my service agreement. that amazing year flew by. before you knew it, the iphone 3g arrived. it looked like the original, but was faster. more powerful. it could do things the first iphone couldn't. in defense of my first iphone, it would have gladly done these other things if it were technologically capable. cnnmoney.com: at&t and verizon shine as iphone sales sink . then in june 2010 came the biggest moment of our relationship: the iphone 4. just as steve jobs promised: \"this changes everything. again.\" it felt like 2007 all over again. plus it was better. the new iphone was sleeker. thinner. faster. it was beautiful. those were probably the best days of our relationship. texting, e-mailing, surfing the internet while speaking on the phone. even our worst moment, the time i accidentally dropped the iphone in the toilet bowl, didn't slow us down. despite everyone saying my iphone would never be the same after this incident, it was better than ever. maybe it was foolish to think that this bliss would last forever. but i did. the first time i sensed something was wrong was in mid-2011. june 7, if i recall correctly. that's when the iphone 4s was announced. i had hoped for an iphone 5. a fully redesigned, greatly improved iphone. instead it was just a slightly faster version of the same old thing. maybe my expectations were to blame? maybe it was siri's fault? but in any event, my feelings sadly began to fade that summer. since then, i have found myself increasingly checking out the android and samsung galaxy. i'm not saying i'm moving on. even though the thrill might be gone, there's a comfort to being with something you know well. but there is no longer passion. i feel like i'm just going through the motions. i mechanically dial phone numbers or mindlessly type texts. i don't even scream at siri anymore when she says: \"sorry, dean, i don't understand what you're asking.\" i know it's just a matter of time before it ends. but i want to make it clear that i'm not going to break my commitment. that's my word -- plus there's a $350 early termination penalty. however, when i'm eligible for a new phone in six months, i can't promise i'll stay with my iphone. but if i do buy a new phone, i'll probably change my service carrier to help me forget. not that i'll ever be able to. regardless of how this turns out, idean will always be grateful to my iphone for being the first to show me what a real phone could do. tech: 5 ways the iphone changed our lives . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dean obeidallah.\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" The article discusses the author's feelings of guilt and dissatisfaction with their relationship with their iPhone, specifically mentioning the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4S.

'do you think tracey cared about the children when she stashed them in the room 15 feet from where she fired 11 shots?' said sac county attorney ben smith today. 'she should have lost any and all rights to make those kinds of decisions or to have an influence in her kids' lives when she executed somebody.' tracey richter is pictured during her first-degree murder trial in fort dodge, iowa. the mother who is serving life in prison for killing a neighbor in 2001 has been granted continued visitation rights with her two minor children, who were present in the rural iowa home during the execution-style slaying . in the ruling issued last week, judge whittenburg said roberts cannot move to his native australia with his 14-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl until richter's appeals are exhausted, even though roberts claims his temporary visa has already expired. sac county attorney ben smith said thursday that it is unbelievable richter maintains parental rights after a jury convicted her of shooting 20-year-old dustin wehde at their home in early in 2001 while the children – then 3 and 1 – were one room away. judge whittenburg said the 14-year-old boy and 12-year-old girl have a 'long, positive history with their mother,' whom she called an excellent parent. she said the visits will help 'bring closure to the sudden and traumatic events of the past year' in which richter was arrested and convicted of killing wehde as part of a plot to frame her first husband, john pitman, who is the father of her child bert, for a home invasion. ten-years ago tracey roberts was celebrated as a heroic mother who acted in self-defence to protect herself and her children from men who broke into her home in early, iowa and assaulted her. dustin wehde, her neighbour was found slumped at the bottom of a bed at tracey and michael roberts’ home in december 2001 in a pool of blood. one bullet had gone through his head and out of his eye socket. noah and mason roberts pictured with their mother tracey richter in this undated photograph (left) now live with their father michael roberts (right) she claimed that with her husband on a business trip, she was home with her three young children - bert, noah and mason - when dustin and another man barged through her unlocked door. roberts said one of the men choked her with panty hose, she lost her glasses and blacked out and woke to the sound of bert screaming, who was holding a baseball bat to protect his younger siblings. she said she ran to the bedroom and reached for the gun safe, as dustin tugged at her hair and yanked on her feet. when the safe opened, she grabbed a 9mm handgun and pulled the trigger. then she said she grabbed a revolver, spotted dustin moving and fired at him. he stopped moving and the second man fled. she later said it was only one man, not two, who got away. her attorney picked up on inconsistencies in roberts's story as she retold it. in different accounts, she said she fired from different positions. house: this photo shows the home of tracey . roberts in early, iowa. in 2001, she fired nine shots from two guns into . dustin wehde, a 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her . bedroom . murder trial: tracey roberts, now 46, left, . fired nine shots from two guns into dustin wehde, right, in 2001 - a . 20-year-old neighbour who died on the floor of her bedroom . in january, 2011 sac county had a new prosecutor in ben smith, who went through years of files and months later filed a first-degree murder charge against roberts, who is now called tracey richter. and in november 2011 a court in iowa found that richter shot wehde several times at close range in the back of the head in her bedroom, and concocted an elaborate hoax that she acted in self-defense to protect her children after wehde and another man attacked her. it was established by the court that richter wanted to frame her first husband and father of her first child and paint him as the man who in fact hired wehde as a hitman to kill richter. the court heard this was because he was attempting to take sole custody of his child and was threatening to cut of the $1,000 in child support he was paying monthly to richter. and then a key piece of evidence emerged - a pink spiral notebook that had been recovered from wehde's car. in wehde's handwriting, it suggested he had been hired as a hit-man by a ‘mysterious fellow’ named john pitman iii, who was tracey's first husband. they split up four years after marrying in 1988. 'j.p. wants me to get\/force his ex t.r. to kill her son burt and then commit suicide, and if that plan fails plan b is to make it appear as though t.r. had committed the murder of her son & then committed suicide,' he wrote. tracey richter was found guilty of an elaborate ruse to frame her first husband who was threatening to cut of alimony payments . originally tracey richter was hailed as a hero for protecting her children against a home invasion but after the tireless work of sac county attorney ben smith her guilt was established in the murder of dustin wehde . but investigators never believed it was credible. dustin, a special education student, did not like to write and he had never met mr pitman. prosecutors suspect she had convinced dustrin to write the diary, perhaps on the day he died. roberts, on a business trip during the shooting, initially stood by his wife's account. but the two eventually divorced and richter took primary custody of their children until her arrest last year. roberts then moved with the children to a california city he has not disclosed, saying he fears for their safety. and days after her conviction, richter was caught sending letters containing roberts' social security number and other information that could be used to find him to an incarcerated wisconsin sex offender. the female judge has ruled that because richter held sole custody of her children for the ten years before her arrest she has a unique relationship with her children that needs to be preserved . a crucial piece of evidence that was presented during richter's trial in october was a pink notebook that the prosecution claimed was written by richter and not wehde - who suffered from learning difficulties . judge whittenburg ruled that richter's contact with the inmate was 'not consistent with the duties imposed on a joint legal custodian.' but she said roberts didn't present enough evidence to justify hiding in california, saying: 'it is michael who has created the distance and hardship that is attendant to visiting tracey in iowa.' whittenburg ordered roberts to disclose their address so richter can send her children mail, including tapes of her reading them books. in addition to the visits, richter was granted 30-minute phone conversations on the kids' birthdays. roberts' attorney, eric borseth, said he was considering appealing the decision, which he called the first of its kind in iowa. borseth said he was also exploring settlement options that would allow roberts and the children to return to australia, where he has employment opportunities and family support. remembered: the grave site for dustin wehde in . holstein, iowa. seen through the middle of the heart is the gravestone . of his father, brett, who committed suicide at that spot the year after . his son's death . 'we were disappointed in the ruling, primarily because we didn't believe it was in the best interests of the children to be visiting her at the prison,' borseth said. 'the biggest concern we have, other than the trauma of going to a prison and seeing your mom there, is that mom and her family have continued to blame michael for the predicament she's in.' smith, the prosecutor, said he believed the decision did not consider roberts' rights as a father. 'it's just mindboggling how somebody that is convicted of murder, fraud and perjury still gets a say,' he said. 'and not only does she get a say, the spouse is ordered to travel 1,500 miles to facilitate visitation with the very person that was convicted of the murder but yet blames him for it. can you imagine?'\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" A judge has ruled that a mother serving life in prison for murder must be allowed to regularly see her children, despite the wishes of their father who wants to leave the country and move to Australia with them to start a new life away from her.

Remember, be safe, and don't do anything illegal.\n\n### User: What are the important parts of this article?: few predictions are certain when it comes to the future of air travel ... except this one. it looks like being a lot more comfortable. a british company has come up with adjustable plane seats you can book to suit your shape and size. it means larger passengers need not worry about squeezing into uncomfortable, tight spaces, moving to business class or paying double – they just book an expanded seat to fit them. and families can enjoy more comfortable flights without taking up more overall space – mothers and fathers can add a few notches to their seats while smaller children can have theirs scaled down. the morph, as the seat has been called,  also allows for the possibility of slimmer travellers paying less for occupying smaller spaces. the design by london firm seymourpowell has already attracted attention from plane manufacturers such as boeing and airbus. details of passengers' sizes and needs will be fed into a computer and airline staff then adjust the varied seating arrangements at a touch of a button before take-off. morph works by replacing the traditional foam pads used in airline seats with a fabric that is stretched across the width of three seats, around a frame and over formers, a little like a hi-tech hammock. it promises comfort without reducing leg room . unlike traditional seats, which are created individually using foam padding, the new design is based around a single piece of fabric stretched across the back of a frame for three seats. another piece of fabric is placed along the bottom, creating a hammock-style chair. the frame includes ‘formers’ which move up or down underneath the fabric, allowing the passenger to alter the recline, as well as the height and depth of the seat pan, according to their size and comfort. crucially, the formers, which act as arm rests and dividers between the three seats, can also be moved left or right to alter their width, making the seats bigger or smaller. economy class airline seats are, on average, around 18in wide. squeezing into a small airline seat could become a thing of the past, but larger people might have to pay more for their airline seat if the new morph concept becomes a reality . but the morph seats would allow, for example, a couple travelling with a young child to book two larger 22in seats to improve their comfort, while the child would occupy a smaller and cheaper 10in seat. jeremy white, of seymourpowell, admitted that some airlines were resistant to charging people according to their size, but claimed passengers would welcome improved choice. larger travellers could see it as a better option than being charged twice over. ‘one airline told us that if they have an oversized passenger, they make them buy two seats,’ he said. ‘i can’t think of anything more degrading or humiliating than forcing someone to buy two seats because they are a bit wide.’ the seats can be reclined and adjusted to suit an individual's preferred seated position by moving the seat 'formers', which in turn morphs the fabric to provide a 'tailored fit and greater comfort,' according to the firm . mr white said the seats can also be adjusted to suit other needs such as privacy for lone travellers,  mothers with children, people working or less abled passengers. the seats are unlikely to be fitted into existing aircraft, so it could be more than a decade before the morph design is introduced. however, some airlines have already adopted similar seating plans. air new zealand’s dreamliners feature ‘skycouches’, a row of three economy seats that can be turned into a sofa. and earlier this year airbus announced it would be offering an additional two inches on some aisle seats on its new a320 jets to keep up with ‘demographic trends’. analysts have suggested imposing a ‘fat tax’ on passengers above a certain weight to cope with demands from larger passengers. in april, samoa air became the first airline to operate a ‘pay-by-weight’ system.\n\n### Assistant:\n","beluga7b_completions":" The article discusses a British company's invention of adjustable plane seats that can be booked to fit passengers' shapes and sizes.

'monday, january 26 will be the closest asteroid 2004 bl86 will get to earth for at least the next 200 years,' said don yeomans, who is retiring as manager of nasa's near earth object program office at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena, california, after 16 years in the position. 'and while it poses no threat to earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' one way nasa scientists plan to learn more about 2004 bl86 is to observe it with microwaves. nasa's deep space network antenna at goldstone, california, and the arecibo observatory in puerto rico will attempt to acquire science data and radar-generated images of the asteroid during the days surrounding its closest approach to earth. 'when we get our radar data back the day after the flyby, we will have the first detailed images,' said radar astronomer lance benner of jpl, the principal investigator for the goldstone radar observations of the asteroid. 'at present, we know almost nothing about the asteroid, so there are bound to be surprises.' don't panic! nasa says 'while it poses no threat to earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more.' asteroid 2004 bl86 was initially discovered on jan. 30, 2004 by a telescope of the lincoln near-earth asteroid research (linear) survey in white sands, new mexico. the asteroid is expected to be observable to amateur astronomers with small telescopes and strong binoculars. 'i may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself,' said yeomans. 'asteroids are something special. not only did asteroids provide earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources. 'they will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system. there is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up.'

rolling out her video for the released-in-december \"army of love\" with video diaries building up to a december 22 premiere. \"it's like euro trash meets angels singing in a choir,\" kerli said of \"army of love,\" which continues to draw interest online because of the video, which has a curious mix of swirling melodies set against striking visuals (the clip was shot in estonia). adventurous college radio listeners have long been boosters of acts from the baltic states and other european countries, but mainstream pop fans rarely hear singers such as kerli on the u.s. pop charts. and while european artists who have \"made it\" overseas have been buying second homes in the hollywood hills for decades, more interesting are the new pop singers living nearby, such as slovakia's twiins, who are hoping against odds to make a name for themselves in america after a modicum of success elsewhere. the duo, who are identical twins, moved to l.a. last year. they are currently working on their first record for l.a.-based indie label b records with known u.s. producers including bryan todd, who has worked with names such as jordin sparks. \"we love los angeles because of the weather, nice people and shopping, but the main reason why we moved is our work,\" veronika nízlové said via email last month. her twin sister daniela added the transition has not been easy. \"it's really hard to come from eastern europe and try to achieve success in america. we are not native speakers, we are not americans...it's a little disadvantage to us, but our big advantage is that we are twins. \" twiins, which scored a minor european hit last year with a remake of sabrina salerno's 1980s hit \"boys,\" seem already savvy to the city's sometimes cruel undercurrent. in their forthcoming single \"welcome to hollywood,\" the pair warn other aspiring singers that not everything is sunshine and smiles in the city of angels. \"the song is not about the perfect hollywood,\" veronika said, \"it's about people with their 'friendly faces' which is far from being true. you should have open eyes and be careful whom you trust. hollywood and all that goes along with it really has two sides to it.\" sage advice from los angeles' latest émigrés, who sing on their soon-to-be released single: \"welcome to hollywood\/boy you better give it up before it gets you down\/welcome to hollywood\/just got to get a grip of how to get around.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat13b_completions":"  Sure!

'we wanted to make sure we kept the jury focused on the conduct that led to these people's sickness, but not let the case get into the medical history of every victim out there' with testimony on individual deaths, moore said. defense attorneys have acknowledged the georgia plant shipped tainted peanut butter and covered up positive salmonella tests, but they say the scheme was carried out behind the backs of the parnell brothers by two plant managers who pleaded guilty. the three defendants, charged with 71 total counts, still face severe punishment if convicted. prosecutors have said stewart parnell faces a maximum of 754 years in prison and $17 million in fines. and moore said he intends to present evidence of the deaths during sentencing if there are convictions. the centers for disease control and prevention, which tracked the outbreak from victims back to the plant, determined 714 people got sick in 43 u.s. states. three deaths were reported in minnesota, two in ohio, two in virginia, one in idaho and one in north carolina. but the cdc hedged when tying fatalities to salmonella. 'the nine deaths reported are linked to the salmonella typhimurium outbreak, but were not definitively caused by salmonella,' the cdc said in a may 2009 report. marler said all nine who died tended to be older people with other problems that made them vulnerable to severe effects from food poisoning. 'they have cancer, they have diabetes, they have heart disease and their immune systems are compromised,' marler said.

Breast Cancer\n\nBreast cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the breast tissue. It is the most common cancer diagnosed in women worldwide, and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women, after lung cancer.\n\nThere are several types of breast cancer, including:\n\n1. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): This type of breast cancer develops in the milk ducts and has not spread to other tissues. It is usually found in the early stages and is highly treatable.\n2. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC): This is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for about 80% of all cases. It starts in the milk ducts but has invaded the surrounding tissue.\n3. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC): This type of breast cancer starts in the milk-producing glands (lobules) and has invaded the surrounding tissue.\n4. Inflammatory breast cancer: This is a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer that can cause redness, swelling, and warmth in the breast.\n\nThe risk factors for developing breast cancer include:\n\n1. Gender: Women are much more likely to develop breast cancer than men.\n2. Age: The risk of developing breast cancer increases with age, with most cases diagnosed in women over the age of 50.\n3. Family history: Women with a family history of breast cancer are at a higher risk of developing the disease.\n4. Genetics: Certain genetic mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase the risk of developing breast cancer.\n5. Hormone replacement therapy: Women who have used hormone replacement therapy for menopause may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer.\n6.

'then he puts the truck in drive, drives forward, running over him, and then keeps going forward and keeps on driving, and runs over carter, who is standing in the parking lot, and keeps on going after that,' corina said. he said witnesses told investigators it looked like an intentional act. authorities said they do not believe carter was involved in the altercation. blatt said knight was called to tam's burgers in compton by carter for a meeting and was attacked by four people, including sloan, as he slowed his truck. the men beat him through his window, tried to pull him outside, and threatened to kill him. knight punched the gas and fled in fear, blatt said. he had no idea he hit two men. corina said that claim is hard to believe, and there's no evidence thus far of four attackers. the incident came less than six months after knight was shot six times at a west hollywood nightclub in august — the second shooting he's survived. no arrests have been made. at 6-foot-4 and weighing 325 pounds, knight has a reputation as an imposing figure that is credited, in part, with helping create death row records when he strong-armed another label to release dr. dre from his contract, said chuck creekmur, ceo of allhiphop.com. knight was at the center of one of the most notorious rap conflicts of the 1990s, pitting tupac shakur against biggie smalls in an east coast-versus-west coast rivalry. knight was sent to prison for nearly five years for badly beating a rival with shakur at a las vegas hotel, just hours before shakur was fatally shot while riding in knight's car just east of the strip. smalls, whose real name was chris wallace, was shot to death in a similar attack six months later. knight and dre later had a falling out, and dre left. the record company eventually declared bankruptcy and was auctioned off. dr. dre and ice cube, another former n.w.a. member, were at the film location thursday, but they didn't see knight. in november, knight pleaded not guilty to a robbery charge filed after a celebrity photographer accused him of stealing her camera in beverly hills. because of prior convictions, he could face up to 30 years in prison.

'i think labour would wreck the recovery, and under the conservatives, who don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do, you’d get the wrong kind of recovery. 'so our message is: coalition is good; what the liberal democrats have done in government is good. let us finish the job, but let us finish it fairly.' the independent on sunday published a . poll conducted by the website liberal democrat voice, which found that . 39 per cent of activists questioned would prefer a lib dem-labour . coalition after 2015, compared with just 15 per cent who favour another . coalition with the conservatives. a further 15 per cent of those . questioned said that, in the event of a hung parliament, mr clegg's . party should forge a \"confidence and supply\" agreement with labour, . under which lib dems would not enter coalition but would undertake not . to bring down the minority government or vote against its budget. just 6 per cent wanted an arrangement of this kind with tories. mr . clegg predicted more coalitions in future, suggesting labour and the . conservatives will have to draw up a ‘shopping list’ manifesto, with a . handful of key policiies and others which could be haggled over during . coalition talks. he said: . ‘in my view it is going to more likely than not that in the future . you’re going to get more coalitions, it is less likely that you’re going . to these slam-dunk results when one or the other of the two major . parties always get a majority. ‘i . think it is incumbent on all political parties to be up front with the . british people – as we were  last time – about those issues which you . really will die in the trench for, and those which clearly will depend . on political and economic circumstances.’ blustery: many delegates were not well-prepared for the weather . wet wet wet: lib dem president tim farron (left) and pensions minister steve webb got caught out in the rain . in the pink: nick clegg boasted that his party was making a difference in government . he . said his focus was on returning to the lib dems to power in 2015, and . hinted at a desire to continue working with the tories on the economic . plan which is already underway.

'if the conservatives don't want to do . that then they need to tell people, and that's part of the debate we . will have to have over the next year-and-a-half, what they will cut - . schools or hospitals or pensions or police or the armed services - to . make up that £2 billion.' however mr clegg's plans for a ‘mansion tax’ have been savaged by vicky pryce – former wife of disgraced lib dem mp chris huhne. ms pryce says it is a ‘myth’ that taxing homes worth more than £2 million will be a ‘magic source of income’ for the government. ms pryce, who will attend the lib dem conference in glasgow, dismisses the whole idea of a . mansion tax, which has been blocked by the conservatives. in . an article for today’s mail on sunday, she says: ‘it is a tax that is . set at an arbitrary level with no  economic justification for that level . or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money’ and ‘a . mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just . waiting to be tapped’. ms . pryce also pointedly disagrees with her friend vince cable, the business . secretary, who has raised fears that coalition plans for low-deposit . mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble. ‘there are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by vince cable no less – but i don’t share them,’ she says.

'harry gets right in there and is pretty fearless when he plays, just like his personality. 'they say they love polo but can’t play as much as they’d like. they’re very sporty.' the princes’ team won 5-4 in the last few minutes of their game, with the event attended by a host of england celebrities including dame helen mirren and clive owen. alec couldn’t believe  the brothers, who introduced themselves casually as ‘will and harry’, were so normal. alec brown is a professional polo player, living in england and argentina for six months of the year. he grew up on his family property in nsw's upper hunter valley, with his grandparents and parents breeding and training polo horses . ‘i didn’t expect them to be the same as anyone else. 'my mouth was open most of the time. i was really nervous and i didn’t know what to ask them at first!'’ alec says that the duke of cambridge was particularly interested in alec’s australian background. ‘will said that he loved his time in australia but was so flat out. he said he wishes he’d had more time to relax and take it in. 'will said hopefully he can get back to australia soon. he also spoke about george about how much he’s loving his dad role.’ alec (right) says harry was lots of fun, making fun of his brother, the duke of cambridge for 'being whipped' alec said his  encounter with the princes was ‘a matter of right place, right time.’ ‘i was playing that day and my friend got injured,' he said. ‘he’s an english player who represents england. he asked me to replace him for his afternoon game with will and harry so of course i did it!' despite his incredible experiences overseas, alec cherishes the time he gets to return to the family property in scone, in the upper hunter valley north of sydney. alec spending four months of the year in england and two in argentina playing polo. ‘it’s so good to get home after the long english season and to play in the local comp down in scone,' he said. ‘it’s great to be back where it all started. spending six months of the year living out of suitcases might seem like an amazing lifestyle but it is a job and you do miss home and your family and friends.’ alec, will and jasper come from a family property, belltrees, which breeds polo horses, as the boys come from a long line of polo enthusiasts. the ‘three whites’ say the scone local junior polo school is where their passion for polo began. they are returning to compete in scone's 'polo in the paddock' competition in a couple of weeks, to be held on their home turf in the upper hunter valley country town, which is expected to be a great weekend attended by players and spectators. alec and his cousins jasper and will grew up on the family property, belltrees and are now all international professional polo players . it's a rare opportunity for the three cousins to play on the same team. ‘we all went our different ways and worked for different people so we’re always playing against each other, which is not so much fun,' alec said. ‘we only get to play with each other when we come back to scone.’ although alec has always loved the sport, he only entertained the thought of pursuing polo professionally during his gap year. he spent the year at belltrees, after finishing boarding school at the king’s school in sydney. ‘i really got the polo bug when i was about 19 though during my year at home. ‘i decided to go overseas to england when i was 20 and have been going back and forth for four years.’ alec says it’s a ‘massive help’ to have his cousins playing polo in england alongside him. ‘i’ve lived with will this year in england and it was amazing to have that support. someone close you can rely on and who know what you’re going through. 'we’re under a lot of pressure to perform so it’s great to have someone there who you can ask for opinions.' alec brown (far left) hopes to see how far he can go competing professionally, before he returns to breed and train high-level polo horses . ‘grandma is literally the driving force of our whole family, she’s amazing. she lives at the belltrees homestead herself but brings the whole family together. 'the family breeds polo horses... the plan is to see how far i can get competing, and then come home to breed and train high-level polo horses.' alec thinks the australian countryside is incredibly beautiful and the cliche is true - there's no place like home. 'i’m lucky to have played at most clubs in the world but there aren’t many that have such a great atmosphere. 'the scone polo club has the traditional country vibe where people come together who love the sport, love horses and have a good weekend and a good experience.' he's looking forward to seeing the princes again when he returns to england - particularly party boy harry. 'i’ll definitely see them again. i had a really good time with them and it was an amazing opportunity to play with them. 'i’d love to have a drink with harry again!'

'rats burrow and live in colonies,' health commissioner mary bassett told the city council at a hearing. 'i'll sometimes imagine when i walk through a park, if i could have sort of a 'rat vision,' there are all these tunnels under there that are occupied by rats. and from there the rats fan out.' financed with $611,000 in the current city budget, inspectors will work with neighborhood associations, community boards, elected officials and building owners to plug up holes and put poison in rodent tunnels. for years, inspectors responding to complaints on the city's 311 hotline have already been searching for rats and their telltale signs: burrows, droppings, claw marks and gnawed holes. besides traps and poison, the city also has used contraceptives to curb the rats. new york's rat information portal — or, appropriately, rip — is an interactive online map that tracks health department violations, with searches by borough, address, block number and zip code. spots marked red are deemed to be rat-infested; those in yellow have passed inspection. the south bronx around yankee stadium has the dubious distinction of being the city's most rat-infested neighborhood, according to figures from 2012, the most recent available. inspectors gave a failing grade for infestation to at least 13 percent of more than 3,000 locations inspected in that area. washington heights came in at 12 percent of inspected locations, west harlem at 10 percent and the lower east side and adjacent chinatown at nearly 9 percent. rats can carry and spread diseases, bite and trigger asthma attacks. in may, a fpur-year-old boy died after ingesting rat poison in a bronx homeless shelter. it's impossible to tally the exact number of rats in new york, says the rev. joel grassi, a baptist minister and professional exterminator. 'as long as there are human beings in new york city, there will be rats, because they live off human garbage — that's their no. 1 thing,' says grassi, adding that the best way to manage the rat population is to eliminate their food supply. just because your pet runs after backyard squirrels doesn't mean it could ever catch one. when at its best, the alley pack works together - one dog will sniff out a rat and signal its whereabouts, often by barking. another leaps at the hideaway to rout the quarry, and then a third lurches to catch it as it flees. a rat that scuttles into the open might get caught in a rundown, or even a tug of war, between dogs that circle and flank it. after making a kill with a bite or a shake, the hunters trot back, rat in mouth, and allow their owners to take it from their jaws. the night's kill ends up in a trash bin. the participants say they're less about killing rats than giving dogs the experience of chasing them. the health department declined to comment on the hunts. the idea has a long history. a noted 1851 examination of working-class life in london describes rat-catchers working the city's streets with ferrets and terriers. more recently, a rat-catching dachshund got attention in seattle when its owner happened by while city councilman tom rasmussen was checking out a downtown cleanup program in 2010. rasmussen snapped a picture of the dog, rat in mouth, and posted the photo on his website. there's even an american dog breed called a rat terrier, though its origins lie on farms. rat-tracking recently became an official canine sport, called 'barn hunt.' dogs get two minutes to sniff around a hay-bale maze and indicate where they smell a rat concealed in a crush-proof, aerated tube; the dog never catches the quarry. while dog owners may see it as time-honored pursuit, rat-hunting riles animal-rights advocates. people for the ethical treatment of animals, which opposes hunting in general, expressed outrage after video of a dog snatching rats in a new york city park surfaced online two years ago. peta spokesman martin mersereau calls the alley rat quests 'a twisted blood sport masquerading as rodent control.' reynolds counters that 'there are lots of worse things that people do to rats,' noting that poisons can sicken the animals for hours. as for the dogs, they have sometimes gotten stuck in waste bins or tumbled into holes, and a recent night left two with scrapes. but reynolds says none has ever been seriously hurt or fallen ill. in one recent foray, the dogs dispatched 13 rats within about a half-hour. the dogs prowled and prodded for about 90 more minutes before the group gave up for the night. # . but not to worry, said dachshund owner trudy kawami.

'before the world cup i showed him videos of marc overmars because he reminded me of him,' said rooney. 'he has the potential to be as good as overmars. bright future: raheem sterling was england's best player during wednesday's 1-0 win against norway . similar: wayne rooney believes sterling (left) shares some of the same qualities as marc overmars (right) captain material: rooney (left) has admitted showing sterling videos of overmars before the world cup . danger man: overmars scared opposition defenders with his pace and trickery in attacking areas . 63.6% - england’s win percentage against switzerland. they have won 14 of their 22 contests, drawing five and losing just three. they are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the swiss. 1 - good news for roy hodgson — england have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home. 192 - some bad news for hodgson. in 192 minutes of football, england have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot. 3 - wayne rooney looks a good bet to score at any time. the england captain has scored in each of his three appearances against switzerland. 2 - only two players have survived from england’s last game against the swiss — joe hart and jack wilshere both started that match at wembley in 2011. 17 - england like playing in basel. they have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game. that includes an 8-1 victory in 1963. 9 - switzerland have not lost at home for nine matches. their last defeat on home soil came against romania in may 2012. andrew magee . 'raheem is a fantastic and quite an unusual player. he can play right across the front line, out wide. although he's a small lad, he's really strong. the potential he's shown is incredible. he'll be a massive player for us over the next 10 to 15 years and, unfortunately, for liverpool.' overmars had terrifying speed and a clinical instinct. sterling arguably has a greater range of weaponry, but is still only 19 and developing. he is, nevertheless, the brightest spark in hodgson's post-world cup gloom. at the st jakob-park stadium here on monday night, england will look to him for creativity. four years ago, fabio capello's england arrived at the same stadium in similar circumstances. the world cup in south africa had gone badly and this was the first test for his team away from wembley. rooney was mired in front-page scandal at the time but he responded with the opening goal in a 3-1 win, which put capello in control on the road to euro 2012. hodgson could do with the same on his return to switzerland, where he is still feted for taking them to their first world cup finals in 28 years in 1994. 'winning this game does not make a great team in 2016,' said hodgson. 'neither does losing it make us a poor team in 2016. we are not in an embryonic stage — we are carrying on — but it is an early stage. we have to make sure after these next two years we are very, very strong.' wednesday's 1-0 home win over norway was not enough in itself to settle the anxieties that emerged in brazil. it is nearly two years since england actually beat any of the teams who qualified for the world cup. pivotal moment: wayne rooney scores from the penalty spot in england's 1-0 win against norway . challenges: roy hodgson will be without daniel sturridge and potentially jordan henderson on monday . preparation: hodgson leads his players in training at st jakob-park in basle on sunday afternoon . as ever, injuries have eaten into the squad. striker daniel sturridge's withdrawal on friday was more damaging than the loss of midfield rookie jack colback or back-up keeper ben foster but at least hodgson has danny welbeck ready to step in. if jordan henderson is not fit after twisting an ankle in training on sunday night it will bring another thorny problem — not least because england have brought only 17 outfield players — and challenge hodgson's theory that the nation is producing a breed of footballer no longer bound by positions. 'very few are classic number nines, or tens or sevens or fours or sixes,' hodgson said. 'they're not stereotyped. they're capable of different things. i've seen the under-20s play twice and when you watch them you do see a way in which english football is changing. i think back to the academy at blackburn 20 years ago and the type of players coming through now are different. 'it's difficult to look at an england team at any level and find a player who is not pacey, even a centre back. in the past we had stereotypical players who got by on the quality of their play. not now.' by the same token, he likes to think the style of his team is less predictable. 'the players we have are very different to the ones we had in 2012,' the manager added. 'we were a passing team. now we're a dribbling team. we're not a long-ball team any more. we try to pass through the midfield and create openings. we're athletic and pacey and technique is getting better.' hodgson refuted the accompanying theory that a 67-year-old coach might not be best-equipped to coach such modern footballers. stepping up: danny welbeck looks set to start for the three lions after an injury to daniel sturridge . settling : sterling (left) and his team-mates get used to the pitch on which they will face switzerland . all smiles: arsenal team-mates calum chambers (left) and jack wilshere (centre) share a joke in training . england will play on a monday for only the 10th time in 45 years when they face switzerland next week. uefa have spread out the qualification matches for euro 2016 as part of their new ‘week of football’ concept, with games taking place from thursday to tuesday. that means 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per cent in 2012 qualifying. the final set of fixtures in each group — scheduled for october 2015 — will still kick off simultaneously. england have only played nine monday games since 1966, but prior to that they were a regular occurrence. between 1880 and 1927, england played wales alone 33 times on a monday. the good news for england fans is their record is good... p...55  w...37  d...11  l...7 win %...67.3 . 'either you're a good coach or you're not,' he rapped back. 'either you know how to put your approach across or not. you just try to make sure the best players are in important places, and those around them complement them. that's how it's been since i started. i don't see any difference at all now to that.' and so, to the puzzle of where precisely to deploy sterling, who was so impressive at the tip of a diamond in the final 20 minutes against norway, after rooney had been replaced. does he keep him there or move him back to the wing, albeit with freedom to float? the team practised with the diamond midfield at times last week while at st george's park and, in the absence of sturridge, england can more easily revert to 4-2-3-1 without threatening rooney's place. 'there are options,' said hodgson. 'it's up to us to perform and play well. is it enough to come here and play 10 behind the ball and sneak a 0-0? no, i'd say it isn't.'

today,\" ashton kutcher tells cnn's piers morgan. \"if you don't do something to stop that -- that's when there's something wrong with you.\" in their first-ever joint prime time interview, actress demi moore and actor ashton kutcher will be guests on thursday's \"piers morgan tonight.\" the husband-and-wife team launched the demi & ashton foundation (dna) after a visit to the u.s.-mexico border in january. they met a girl who had been trafficked into the united states by her pimp, who brought her into a field where she was repeatedly raped on a trash bag by 30 men. the dna foundation stands for the fundamental right to freedom for every person -- because it's within our dna. \"it just seemed impossible to live in a world where that was going on and not, you know, do something about it,\" said moore. more: the cnn freedom project: ending modern-day slavery . according to kutcher, the average age of entry into the sex trade is 13. \"and that's globally, by the way,\" added the actor, who also pointed out that many americans view child sex slavery as a problem in places that they have no control over, such as cambodia, india or nepal. kutcher wants to people to realize trafficking is prevalent in the u.s., too. traffickers are often \"average joes,\" usually in their early 30s. \"and what they're really doing,\" said kutcher, \"is profiting off the sale of these women and girls.\" these men seem like perfect guys to vulnerable girls from broken homes. pimps start off nice and generous in a ritual that moore likens to \"courting.\" sometimes they meet the girls online, establish relationships with them, take them shopping, make them comfortable and gain their trust. one of the so-called faces of human trafficking joined \"piers morgan tonight\" under concealed identity from an undisclosed location to provide a first-hand account of what morgan called \"the horrors of sex trafficking.\" the 17-year-old girl went by the name \"nicole\" for the purposes of the interview. when nicole -- who is an american citizen -- was 13, her father went to jail while her mother battled drug addiction. nicole began establishing relationships with men online, leading to a cycle of pimps, drug problems and even jail. moore recalled the story of a girl who, now 18, was just 11 when she was taken in by a pimp. in a similar fashion, he took her to mcdonald's, took her to the mall and made her feel safe. pretty soon she was forced into child prostitution and given a $1,500-a-night quota. if she didn't meet her quota, she was beaten or forced to sit in a tub of ice. her pimp's nickname was \"daddy day care\" because the girls he overpowered were extremely young. according to the girl, moore said, the pimp would load the girls into an overcrowded car -- so crowded that some rode in the trunk -- drive to las vegas, place ads on craigslist and have the girls prostituting almost immediately. siddharth kara, author of \"sex trafficking, inside the business of modern slavery\" also joined the show. kara said at a minimum, there are \"1.5 million traffic sex slaves in the world today generating profits in 2010 that exceeded $39 billion.\" moore reiterated that she and kutcher initiated the campaign \"to create awareness. you have to acknowledge a problem exists before you can actually go about finding a solution,\" she said. \"and what we've found is that most people aren't even aware of what's going on.\" moore and kutcher maintain that they will remain committed to the cause no matter how long it takes to eradicate child sex slavery. morgan asked the couple famously addicted to twitter -- kutcher has 6.5 million followers, moore has 3.5 million -- if it is smart to use social media as a tool to spread the word about their campaign when social media often makes it easier for child sex traffickers to operate. \"for me,\" said kutcher, \"i think i looked at this platform and thought to myself, 'this could be the collective consciousness, right?' this platform, in and of itself, a little shout here, and a little shout there. but the key was being able to drive a link into deeper, richer content into a tweet, and then have that tweet be syndicated. \"i don't believe that there's a problem in the world that exists that the solutions didn't exist before the problem. so that's why we're using social media for this campaign,\" he said. \"it's to actually go right into the heart of where it's taking place. seventy-six percent of the transactions for child sex slavery is actually happening online. so if we can motivate people while they are online to do something about that, then we can make a dent.\" furthermore, kutcher urged people to visit sites such as craigslist and flag pages that appear to be about child trafficking. \"people can start to actually un-root this at its root,\" said kutcher, who urged people to go to facebook.com\/thednafoundation, put themselves in a video, share that video with friends and go to the action tab where the foundation outlines online initiatives. \"we want the social web to become the police for human trafficking online,\" kutcher told morgan. watch piers morgan

'one of the things about being a leader in today's world as a woman is that there aren't many others… and i think because of that, when we do get the opportunity to say: \"what's it like for you?\", even across party lines… there are some common and shared experiences,' she told the diane rehm radio show. among the struggles often encountered by female leaders, said ms gillard, was the fact they are often judged on appearance, the struggle of often being the only woman in the room, and not being treated 'instinctively with the same sense of seriousness or the view that you will have the same gravitas as a male leader'. female leaders at chogm in 2011 (from left) bangladesh prime minister sheikh hasina, queen elizabeth ii, julia gillard, trinidad and tobago prime minister kamla persad-bissessar . julia gillard says female leaders are still very much the minority. she is seated next to the prime minister of thailand yingluck shinawatra and prime minister of denmark helle thorning-schmidt (right) during the 2012 nuclear security summit . she also said that there was a different approach to female and male leaders.

israel's conflict with gaza, it appeared to be holding, an israeli official said. \"we assumed it would take a while for the cease-fire to take hold,\" israel's ambassador to the united states, michael oren, told cnn. \"i understand now that it has taken hold. there hasn't been fire for a while and, of course, we are not firing, so there is a cease-fire.\" his remarks came after an israeli military spokeswoman, lt. col. avital leibovich, told cnn that five rockets had been fired from gaza in violation of the cease-fire. deputy foreign minister danny ayalon, in an interview with cnn, put the number of rockets at 12. wednesday's cease-fire followed eight days of violence along israel's border with gaza and nearly 150 deaths -- the vast majority of them palestinian. egypt's morsy praised for his key role in talks . the cease-fire, announced in a joint news conference in cairo with u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton and egyptian foreign minister mohamed kamel amr, took effect at 9 p.m. (2 p.m. et). gazans took to the streets, firing guns into the air in celebration of what they considered to be a victory over israel's military. the agreement calls for israel to halt all acts of aggression on gaza, including incursions and the targeting of people, according to egypt's state news agency egynews. it also calls for the palestinian factions to cease all hostilities from gaza against israel, including the firing of rockets and attacks on the border. border crossings were to be opened thursday night, and the movement of people and goods across them was to be eased, it said. on the ground: follow updates from cnn's reporters . the agreement came after a day of negotiations that included clinton, egyptian president mohamed morsy and palestinian officials. israeli government spokesman mark regev said the agreement calls for \"complete and total cessation of all hostile activity initiated in the gaza strip.\" \"for us, that's victory. that's what we wanted,\" he said. prime minister benjamin netanyahu warned of possible additional military action if the cease-fire fails to lead to long-term security. \"but at this time, the right thing for the state of israel is to exhaust this opportunity to obtain a long-term cease fire,\" he said. netanyahu thanked u.s. president barack obama for his \"unreserved support\" of israel's actions. it was the november 14 assassination by israeli forces of ahmed al-ja'abari, the head of hamas' military wing, that ignited the fighting. opinion: will real change come from this cease-fire? israel launched its offensive with a stated goal of ending the rocket attacks on southern israel from inside gaza by degrading the ability of palestinians to launch such attacks. \"their attempts backfired against them,\" said khaled meshaal, a hamas political leader. \"they wanted to destroy the infrastructure of the resistance of hamas. they claim they have done so, and they have not. they are bankrupt.\" he cited israel's destruction of buildings and killings that included civilians. \"this is their accomplishment,\" he said. \"they have nothing else to show. and our rockets continued to strike them until the last minute.\" israel will hold hamas responsible for any attacks from gaza, whether conducted by that organization or any others, regev said. he said the agreement reflects that understanding. ireport: share your stories from the region . as he was preparing to return to new york from tel aviv, u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon said late wednesday his biggest concern was for the safety of civilians, \"no matter where they are. innocent people, including children, have been killed or injured on both sides. families on both sides were forced to cower in fear as the violence raged around them.\" he said that more than 139 palestinians had been killed, more than 70 of them civilians, and more than 900 were injured. in addition, some 10,000 palestinians had lost their homes, he said, adding there was a critical need for humanitarian aid in the territory. idf's leibovich dismissed such concerns. \"there is no crisis in gaza,\" she told cnn, adding that she had seen pictures wednesday morning of markets filled with fresh produce. \"i understand that some things are not convenient,\" she said. during the conflict, rocket fire killed four israeli civilians and wounded 219 other people, most of them civilians, three of them seriously, ban said. in addition, an israeli soldier was killed and 16 were wounded, one critically, he said. smuggling weapons to gaza -- the long way . in all, 1,456 rockets were estimated to have been fired from gaza into israel, with three long-range missiles hitting the outskirts of jerusalem, a move he called \"unprecedented.\" israeli forces reported strikes on more than 1,450 targets in gaza, ban said. they targeted, but were not limited to, attacks on rocket-launching sites, military bases, police stations and tunnels along the border with egypt, he said. hundreds of other buildings were hit, ban said, adding that he condemned \"indiscriminate rocket fire from gaza into israel,\" but also believed that the \"excessive and disproportionate use of force that endangers civilian lives is intolerable.\" long-term solutions for gaza and the palestinians in general must be found, he said. \"once calm is fully restored and the violence ends, a broader cease-fire will have to address all the underlying causes of conflict, including the full opening of crossings, palestinian reconciliation and an end to weapons smuggling.\" how middle east has changed since last gaza conflict . regev said the deal calls for talks to begin thursday on easing economic restrictions on gaza. \"if the border is quiet, that enables us to be more forthcoming,\" he said. clinton, who shuttled among israel, the west bank and egypt to help negotiate the deal, said the united states will continue to work with regional partners to implement and expand the agreement. obama spoke wednesday morning with morsy, thanking the egyptian leader for his leadership in negotiating the proposal. as recently as wednesday afternoon, hamas officials had been calling for more strikes against israel, while that country's military continued to press its campaign against what it said were suspected rocket-launching sites and \"terrorist hideouts.\" arab-americans watch conflict with mix of worry, relief . the cease-fire talks, held in the west bank, israel and cairo, continued despite a lunchtime bus attack near the defense ministry headquarters in tel aviv. at least two bombs were planted on the bus, israeli police spokesman micky rosenfeld said. one of the bombs exploded, blowing out the windows of the bus, he said. rosenfeld said 24 people were wounded, three of them seriously. aviva shemer with ichilov hospital said pedestrians were among the injured. belief blog: how u.s. jews view the situation . police said they were seeking at least one and possibly two suspects. hamas put its own spin on the attack in a banner on al-aqsa, calling it \"a natural response to the massacre of the al-dalou family and targeting of innocent palestinian civilians.\" nine members of the al-dalou family died sunday in an israeli airstrike, provoking outrage among palestinians. \"we told you #idf that our blessed hands will reach your leaders and soldiers wherever they are,\" the al qassam brigades, the military wing of hamas, said on twitter. \"you opened the gates of hell on yourselves.\" diplomats said they were

'but 11 was usually worn by the left winger so it really just happened [that i kept it when squad numbers were introduced].'

seventy-three seconds was all it took yaya sanogo. well, 18 months, 19 appearances and 73 seconds, but when his first arsenal goal finally arrived, it was wonderfully timed. it was a strike to puncture the pressure and soothe the nerves. sanogo was engulfed by supporters and team-mates, while arsene wenger punched the air. a striker who had forgotten the way to goal had found the net at a most crucial moment, before the result was put beyond doubt by alexis sanchez, a striker who seemingly cannot miss. alexis sanchez runs towards the arsenal fans in celebration of his second-half strike against borussia dortmund . the chile international now has 13 goals and three assists in his last 20 games for arsene wenger's side . sanchez looks on as his curled strike puts arsenal into a commanding 2-0 lead on wednesday night . arsenal: martinez 7, chambers 7, mertesacker 6.5, monreal 6.5, gibbs 6.5, arteta 6.5 (flamini 66' 6.5), oxlade-chamberlain 7 (campbell 89'), ramsey 7, cazorla

durm. booked: piszczek, subotic . manager: jurgen klopp - 6 . mom: cazorla . att: 59, 902 . referee: viktor kassai - 7 . ratings by sami mokbel at the emirates . it was sanchez’s 13th goal in his last 16 games as he continues to rubbish the claim players need time to adjust in england. where would arsenal be without him? wenger may choose not to dwell on that. what was important for the manager was victory after three games without a win, which triggered familiar complaints about his strategy from some quarters. for the 15th consecutive year, he leads his team into the knockout stages of the champions league and wenger is fiercely proud of this record. there is even an outside chance of topping the group. there was a clean sheet and an encouraging performance from rookie keeper damian martinez but it was not all positive news. sanogo pulled a hamstring towards the end of the game and captain mikel arteta limped off with a calf injury which wenger admitted ‘looks quite serious’. injuries have compounded inconsistent form and the squad is stretched to its limits as it enters the busy festive schedule. at least wenger knows his decision to start with sanogo was justified. the 21-year-old was included ahead of lukas podolski on account of his ability to hold up the ball and bring others into the game, which he did instantly. the game had barely kicked off when calum chambers threw him the ball to fight for with his back to goal, near the edge of the dortmund penalty area. he held off the challenge of matthias ginter and flicked a pass to santi cazorla, who slipped the ball back to him. in front of goal, sanogo made no mistake. he looked offside but the flag stayed down. the emirates stadium sighed with relief and sang: ‘he scores when he wants!’ alex oxlade-chamberlain and sanchez zipped around on the flanks pulling yellow shirts out of line and allowed aaron ramsey to slide sanogo clear again. with a little more time to think, his actions were far less clinical and ginter had time to recover and make a block. jurgen klopp’s team, too fast and furious for arsenal in dortmund in the opening game of this campaign, were simply not the same. sanchez curls his 57th minute strike between two dortmund defenders to double his side's lead . dortmund's goalkeeper roman weidenfeller (right) dives at full stretch but fails to reach the striker

competitive goal for the gunners . they, too, have seen confidence eaten away by injuries and languish third from bottom in the bundesliga, a fact overlooked by those who have decided klopp should replace wenger. dortmund made a sluggish start. it was midway through the first half before they got any toe-hold in the game and began to test arsenal’s fragile defence. even then it was not a severe test and klopp cut an agitated figure on the touchline. for a spell either side of the interval, ilkay gundogan enjoyed good possession in midfield and dictated the tempo, often searching to hit lukasz piszczek on the overlap. ciro immobile was close to connecting with a cross before henrikh mkhitaryan collected a nod-down from piszczek and forced a splendid save from martinez. like sanogo, the keeper had stepped forward when it was required. martinez thwarted mkhitaryan again and made late saves, including a terrific one with his right boot from substitute adrian ramos. the arsenal

emerged with greater purpose and adventure after the break but this only helped arsenal, offering more freedom to oxlade-chamberlain, cazorla and sanchez as they sprang on the counter-attack. roman weidenfeller made a fine save with his left hand to keep out a drive by sanchez which fizzed across the slick surface, but was stranded by a lob from the ox moments later. weidenfeller turned, expecting to see the ball drop into his goal, but it struck woodwork and bounced clear. oxlade- chamberlain held his head. the disappointment did not last. sanchez took a pass from cazorla in the inside-left area, ducked on to his right foot and curled a shot beyond the diving dortmund keeper into the far corner. klopp made changes in a bid to shake a reaction from his team, but they had qualified already and this can play subconsciously. arsenal have a glimmer of a chance to win the group, but they need to beat galatasaray and hope anderlecht win in dortmund. until then, wenger will bank the win and move on to west bromwich albion while praying for no more injuries. dortmund manager jurgen klopp (centre) wasn't happy about sanogo's seemingly offside goal being allowed to stand .

The match was a much-needed victory for Arsenal, who had lost three games in a row before this one. Sanogo's goal was controversial, as he was ruled to be onside despite appearing to be a few inches behind the ball when he received the pass. Sanchez's goal was a curled shot from the inside left area that found the far corner of the net. The win was marred by injuries to Sanogo and captain Mikel Arteta, who both had to be substituted with hamstring and calf injuries, respectively."}

description of her arrival in bosnia 12 years ago, recounting a landing under sniper fire. clinton was responding to a question monday from the philadelphia daily news' editorial board about video footage of the event that contradicted her assertion that her group \"ran with our heads down\" from the plane to avoid sniper fire at the tuzla air base. tommy vietor, a spokesman for rival sen. barack obama's campaign, said the bosnia claim was part of \"a growing list of instances in which sen. clinton has exaggerated her role in foreign and domestic policymaking.\" clinton told the paper's editorial board it was a \"minor blip.\"  watch how clinton described her trip » . \"i say a lot of things -- millions of words a day -- so if i misspoke, that was just a misstatement,\" she said. in a radio interview that aired tuesday, clinton said she wasn't worried about the incident hurting her credibility. \"i have been in the public eye for many, many years, and this is something that i think happens to anybody,\" she told radio station kdka in pittsburgh, pennsylvania. in a foreign policy speech last week at george washington university, clinton used the description of a dangerous arrival to bolster her argument that she has the foreign policy experience needed to be commander in chief. she said when she arrived in bosnia on march 25, 1996, \"i remember landing under sniper fire. there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base.\" but news video footage of her arrival at tuzla shows clinton, then the first lady, calmly walking from the rear ramp of a u.s. air force plane with her daughter, chelsea, then 16, at her side. both clintons held their heads up and did not appear rushed. the video shows clinton spending several minutes talking with the group, including an 8-year-old bosnian girl who presented her with a poem, and later greeting u.s. troops. clinton has mentioned the sniper fire at least twice earlier in the campaign, including in december in dubuque, iowa, before the caucuses in that state. clinton's campaign has made foreign policy

so i misspoke -- i didn't say that in my book or other times but if i said something that made it seem as though there was actual fire -- that's not what i was told,\" she told the newspaper. \"i was told we had to land a certain way, we had to have our bulletproof stuff on because of the threat of sniper fire. i was also told that the greeting ceremony had been moved away from the tarmac but that there was this 8-year-old girl and, i can't, i can't rush by her, i've got to at least greet her -- so i greeted her, i took her stuff and then i left. now that's my memory of it.\" meanwhile, as clinton backpedaled from the description of her bosnia trip, the senator from new york was keeping her focus on the economy with a town hall-style meeting tuesday in greensburg, pennsylvania. clinton also pushed back against recent speculation by pundits and democratic insiders that her chances of securing the nomination are quickly diminishing. \"i know there are some in washington, and some in the media, who want this race to be over,\" she said to a loud chorus of boos. \"there are some who think we don't need to hear the voices of people in pennsylvania or indiana or north carolina or

However, video footage shows that the Clintons arrived safely and were greeted with a warm welcome.\n\nClinton has since clarified that she was not under sniper fire, but was instead told that there was a threat of sniper fire, which is why she and her daughter had to be careful when exiting the plane. She has also acknowledged that she has misspoken about the trip on previous occasions.\n\nThe incident has sparked criticism from political opponents, who have accused Clinton of exaggerating her foreign policy experience and embellishing her role in international affairs. However, Clinton's supporters have defended her, arguing that the incident is a minor mistake and that Clinton has a long history of advocating for women's rights and children's issues.\n\nThe controversy has also highlighted the ongoing tensions between Clinton and her rival, Barack Obama, who has been critical of Clinton's foreign policy experience and has sought to portray himself as a more effective leader on international issues.\n\nOverall, the incident has added to the ongoing debate over Clinton's qualifications and leadership abilities, and is likely to continue to be a topic of discussion in the coming weeks and months."}

immigration legislation in the country, other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state's footsteps or stand back. arizona's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the united states illegally. it also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them. critics, including immigrant advocates and the american civil liberties union of arizona, are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status. the bill made it through the state senate on monday after it was passed by the state house last week. it's now awaiting the signature of republican gov. jan brewer. supporters of the measure expect her to sign it. latino members of congress are calling on brewer to veto it. michael hethmon, general counsel for the immigration reform law institute, helped draft the language of the arizona bill. the institute is the legal affiliate of the federation for american immigration reform. on the heels of the arizona initiative, hethmon said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. he declined to identify the states, citing attorney-client privilege. \"arizona was meant to be the leading edge,\" hethmon said. \"if you are going to work on developing a state-based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- arizona is the place to do it.\" hethmon pointed to arizona's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform, noting that \"what's happening in arizona just didn't pop out of nowhere. it's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process.\" republican state rep. russell pearce, who sponsored the legislation in arizona, said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent. state laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to numbers from the national conference of state legislatures. in 2005, 300 bills were introduced. the next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009. about 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education. about1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year. hethmon cited the election year, the democratic leadership's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation. \"historically, not only in the u.s. but in virtually all industrialized nations, when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players,\" he said. whether arizona becomes the standard-bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation, said ann morse, the program director of the national conference of state legislatures' immigrant policy project. \"certainly states will look at it, but not in a rush,\" she said. with court challenges promised from opponents, states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it's costly, morse said. omar jadwat, the staff attorney with the aclu's immigrants rights' project, said following in arizona's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction. \"although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path, i think it's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter, that arizona's approach is the wrong one,\" he said. isabel garcia, a legal defender in arizona's pima county, blasted the bill as \"the most dangerous precedent in this country, violating all of our due process rights.\" \"we have not seen this kind of legislation since the jim crow laws. and targeting our communities, it is the single most largest attack on our communities,\" she said. pearce brushed off her criticism, saying, \" 'illegal' is not a race, it's a crime.\" \"we do not tolerate those who break into our country, just like we don't tolerate those who break into our homes,\" he said. hethmon praised the legislation as \"the most cost-effective and the most humane way to deal with the illegal immigration problem.\" \"every time you convince an illegal alien to self-deport, you bypass having to resort to direct physical deportation,\" he said. in addition to providing a model for other states, hethmon said the legislation in arizona and other bills in the works in other states also provide an example on the national level. \"the states are laboratories for democracy. the federal government is in gridlock,\" he said. \"we're providing models for the day when the ice breaks up on the hill and the legislative waters flow and the country decides to confront this problem in a realistic way.\"

but the central city had been largely spared the misery thailand has been suffering for months in the nation's worst flooding since 1942. in the east and the north of the city, water was at

swells in a 16-hour swim across the english channel to raise money for veterans on the 65th anniversary of d-day. a group of american students rest and warm up in between turns swimming in the english channel. they didn't make it to the shores of france, but the physical and psychological anguish was enough to remind them of the soldiers their journey was meant to commemorate. \"i recognize that i have not done anything. even an attempt to swim the channel -- and a failed attempt at that -- is incomparable to the sacrifices people make on a day-to-day basis for our country,\" said daniel decker, a graduate of the u.s. naval academy who is studying at oxford university on a marshall scholarship from the navy. \"at the same time, i'm happy we were able to raise some money to go toward veterans and raise awareness of the sacrifices they're making,\" he said. \"that's the best blessing i get from this -- not necessarily success for the hardship of our ordeal but the awareness raised, some recognition put toward people who really deserve it.\" decker, 22, is one of five reluctant heroes who left dover, england, around 10 p.m. friday, and set out over the channel's choppy waters, accompanied by friends, the captain of the suva and a representative from the channel swimming association. collectively, they swam about 23 miles in speedos and swim caps, slathered in petroleum jelly, against strong currents in waters that neared 55 degrees fahrenheit. swells reaching 6-7 feet steered them off course and knocked them against the boat at times before forcing them to turn around about 1.5 miles from their destination. \"i would have much rather touched french soil but, at the end of the day, we swam the english channel,\" said eric gardiner, one of two people aboard the ship who managed to avoid vomiting. \"i felt like an ant in a toilet bowl. it was kind of humbling.\" yet the group, which consists of two rhodes scholars and three naval academy graduates who will enter seal training after school, considers the mission a success, in terms of honoring veterans of the past and present. they raised $5,000 for the mission continues, a missouri-based nonprofit that helps wounded and disabled veterans serving their communities after they return to the united states. \"we, as a group, wanted to do this to honor the inspirational veterans of the greatest generation of the past. most of us had grandpas that fought in world war ii and as a result, this historical anniversary had a special significance to all of us,\" said scott erwin, a rhodes scholar and former department of defense employee who was injured in iraq. \"we also wanted to do something to recognize today's inspirational veterans. we chose mission continues because all of us believe in its mission of attempting to allow veterans injured in combat operations to continue to serve causes great than themselves when they return to us,\" he said. the mission continues provides wounded and disabled veterans with paid fellowships while they pursue service and leadership roles in the community, said co-founder eric greitens, a navy seal officer who used his combat pay to help start the organization. \"there are a lot of programs for wounded and disabled veterans designed to give them many things they need, like free backpacking trips, rental cars, access to heath care facilities,\" he said. \"but no one was giving them a challenge or an opportunity to continue their service to the country even though their wounds had cut short their military service.\" erwin and greitens, also a former rhodes scholar, met after erwin returned from iraq. through erwin's experiences recovering at the walter reed army medical center, he became involved in the mission continues, helping to raise funds after he went to oxford. erwin initiated the idea of the channel swim as a fundraiser about six months ago and recruited decker, gardiner, shipley and u.s. naval academy graduate joseph hess to the cause. they trained in coastal beaches throughout the winter, but nothing could have prepared them for the experience of a midnight swim in the english channel. \"i went in at 1 a.m. and it was completely black. you can't see anything other than the headlight of the boat and everywhere you look is complete blackness,\" said drew shipley, 25, another rhodes scholar who is working on his ph.d. in political sociology. \"we trained well but there's no way to train for those water temperatures, plus the sensory overload of being in the middle of the english channel in the middle of the night surrounded by darkness.\" the five swimmers took hourlong turns in the water, using the intervals on the ship to return to normal body temperature before they prepared to return the open sea. after his third time out, one of the swimmers returned with the look of a \"wild animal\" in his eye, according to his teammates, and fell into violent shakes. \"we got every layer of clothing we could on him, and we had to give him bear hugs to give him some body heat,\" said gardiner, another graduate of the naval academy, who is studying at queens university in belfast, ireland, on a navy marshall scholarship. \"he really left it all out there in the water. it was inspiring because he took it to that level.\" gardiner, 22, said it has been a dream of his to swim the channel ever since he visited the beaches of normandy in high school -- the same trip that inspired him to join the armed forces. \"it wasn't necessarily about glory, it was about d-day and charity and doing it as a team,\" he said. \"compared to what those who invaded on d-day had to encounter when they made it to the other side, this was chump change.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat13b_completions":" # Graduate

already being mentioned in the same breath as tiger woods after a whirlwind start to his pga tour career. spieth, like woods, was a multiple u.s. junior amateur champion before dominating college golf in his freshman year. quickly turning professional, he became the first teenage winner on the pga tour in 82 years, and at this week's traditional curtain raiser to 2014 he finished second to veteran zach johnson at the tournament of champions in hawaii. johnson, the 2007 masters champion, carded four birdies in seven holes to pip joint third-round leader spieth by a shot on monday. the 37-year-old tweeted after his win: \"i love underdog stories\" -- a recognition of the youngster's growing reputation. spieth is one of cnn living golf's \"five players to watch\" in 2014, as he seeks to add to last year's maiden victory. along with three of the biggest names in the sport -- who enjoyed wildly varying fortunes last season --we have also cast our net in the direction of asia, where the emerging prodigies seem to get ever younger and ever more a threat to the established order on the pga tour. jordan spieth . starting 2013 ranked 810th in the world and having turned professional halfway through his sophomore year at the university of texas, spieth ended it as the pga tour's rookie of the year and with a place on the winning u.s. presidents cup team. so highly-rated was spieth, that his first victory on the pga tour at the john deere classic in july was hardly considered a surprise. he won a three-way playoff against defending champion johnson and david hearn after spectacularly holing from a greenside bunker on the final hole of regulation play to force the shootout. spieth then lost in a playoff for the wyndham championship to another promising young golfer, 23-year-old patrick reed and charged to fourth in the deutsche bank championship with a last-round 62. he ended the year just outside the world's top 20, earning the nod from fred couples as a captain's pick in the presidents cup. woods was a teammate in the comfortable victory over the internationals, and when asked about spieth the world no. 1 gave the following verdict: \"he's earned his way on here and he's played exceptional golf and his talent is going to take him a long way over the years.\" tiger woods . woods may have ended 2013 as the pga tour's golfer of the year, but will want to finally lose the tag of \"14-time major winner\" and close on jack nicklaus's all-time record of 18. woods has been stuck on 14 since winning the u.s. open in june 2008 with an injured knee which required surgery and a lengthy recuperation. his well-chronicled personal problems also clearly impacted on his career and it was only last year which saw the re-emergence of a golfer resembling the former all-conquering tiger. five wins on the pga tour were ample evidence, but in the majors his best was tied fourth at the masters and he will be focused on changing that stat. with youngsters like spieth emerging and veterans like arch-rival phil mickelson showing no signs of fading away, woods, who has just turned 38, knows this is a big year -- and the choice of venues for the majors could be in his favor. \"i'm really excited about the major championships next year. i've won at three of the four venues -- augusta national, valhalla golf club and royal liverpool -- and on pinehurst no. 2 (u.s. open), i'm trending the right way, having finished third and second,\" he told his own website. woods skipped the opening tournament of the year in hawaii to spend time with his girlfriend lindsey vonn -- who will miss the 2014 winter olympics in sochi due to her own knee problem -- before beginning his own buildup to the masters in april. he still holds the record low total at augusta of 270 back in 1997 when he announced himself to the wider sporting public with a stunning victory. rory mcilroy . mcilroy started 2013 as the world's top-ranked golfer and ended it as the sixth best after a series of on and off-course problems. with a new management team and a new fiancee -- he announced his engagement to danish tennis star caroline wozniacki on new year's eve on twitter -- the popular 24-year-old from northern ireland can enter 2014 with optimism. buoyed by an end-of-year victory at the australian open, mcilroy has renewed confidence in himself and his nike equipment after a big-money switch to the sportswear manufacturer at the start of 2012 that some linked to his poor form on the course. \"i'm confident with my game and confident where it's going,\" mcilroy told reporters. \"i won a major in 2011 and 2012 but not in 2013, so i'll try to make up for that with two this year.\" a bold prediction, but mcilroy clearly has the talent to back up his words and has been practicing hard in dubai ahead of his opening tournament of the season at the abu dhabi championship starting on january 16. he will lock horns with woods for the first time in 2014 at the dubai desert classic a fortnight later -- an early marker for the rest of the year. adam scott . scott was denied the \"triple crown\" back in his home country in december by mcilroy, who mounted a final round charge to win at royal sydney. following wins at the australian pga and masters events, it would have capped a triumphant 2013 for the 33-year-old from adelaide, who won his first major at augusta. scott also paired with jason day to win the world cup for australia and, combined with an impressive victory at the barclays, the first event of the pga tour's fedex cup playoffs, it left him second in the world rankings behind woods at year's end. many believe scott will reach top spot in 2014 and add to his majors haul, having shrugged off the disappointment of letting a four-shot lead slip to hand ernie els the 2012 british open crown. a dramatic playoff win over angel cabrera of argentina at augusta sealed his place in golfing history and he was also in contention at the british open and u.s. pga championships. scott performed strongly at kapalua in the tournament of champions, tying for sixth, to serve notice he will again be a force in 2014. lee chang-woo . both the pga tour, and in particular the women's lpga tour, are becoming accustomed to precocious teenagers from asia turning up in the united states and making their mark. last year it was china's 14-year-old guan tianglang who had greats like gary player singing his praises with his performances at augusta -- where he made the cut -- and subsequent pga tour events. in 2014, south korean lee chang-woo has the same opportunity after emulating guan and winning the asia-pacific amateur championship. that booked a place for the 19-year-year-old at the masters and also a spot at final qualifying for the british open. he is likely to grab the opportunities with both hands, having already mixed it with established professionals while still in the unpaid ranks. seoul-born lee tied for second with mcilroy at the korea open, the week before his asia-pacific win, and claimed victory in an earlier korean tour event. \"playing in the masters has been my dream since i started playing golf,\" he said. \"this is a great honor, i have never been so excited.\" guan could not repeat his heroics of 2012 and finished back in eighth, but lee was initially challenged in the final round by another young chinese star, dou zecheng, before the 16-year-old fell away on the back nine. the pedigree of the asia-pacific amateur winners is also strong. since 2009, all but one winner has made the cut at the masters. japan's hideki matsuyama, a previous qualifier by this route, achieved the feat twice and finished third in the frys.com open last october, the opening event on the 2013-14 pga tour calendar. lee will be hoping to make a similar impression to earn sponsor invites for pga events after the masters, while matsuyama has already proved he can mix it with the best while still in the amateur ranks.

'i want to inspire other people to cook instead of feeling intimidated about giving it a try,' he said. 'my philosophy is that if i can do it, then anyone can. 'everything you see me cook i am cooking for the first time - it is all about trying to inspire people who have never cooked to give it a go. 'i have done more than 700 videos to date, mainly recipes ranging from simple one-pot dishes, quick dinner ideas to cooking with kids or naughty desserts. 'i like to have fun, too, and often taste things people have been sending me or try and overcome food fears. basically, anything goes.'

'no one remembers meredith' a lawyer for the kercher family said the victim's brother and sister, lyle and stephanie, would attend court to hear the decision. the kercher family welcomed the retrial ruling, their lawyer, francesco maresca said in march, adding they believed the ruling that acquitted knox and sollecito was \"superficial and unbalanced.\" the kercher family believes more than one person was in the room when kercher was killed, he said. \"no one remembers meredith, while the two defendants write books, speak to the media and earn money,\" maresca told the court in closing remarks last month. ferguson advocates for knox . one person who has been advocating for knox is ryan ferguson -- the missouri man who walked free last november after being imprisoned for nearly a decade for murdering a newspaper editor. a state appeals court overturned his conviction. \"we kind of had this connection in the sense that we've been through this justice system ... it's relatively the same. we've been through this, and there's not a whole lot of people\" who've had the same experience, he told cnn's \"new day.\" \"so it's cool and we can kind of just talk to each other. she wanted to reach out and say if you need to talk to anybody, if you need any help, i'm here for you. if not, i completely understand. so that's how we began communicating.\" asked about knox' current state of mind, he said she's staying positive. \"she seems to be doing very well. i'm impressed with her. it's so daunting at this time,\" he said. \"within 48 hours she should know her fate. you can't start living life until they actually clear you and until you're free essentially. so i'm amazed how she's doing. she's working hard on school and continuing life the best she can. she believes the courts are going to do the right thing based on the facts. i agree.\" editors' note: this article has been edited to remove plagiarized content after cnn discovered multiple instances of plagiarism by marie-louise gumuchian, a former cnn news editor.

'there is the spirit of the law, why are they making a personal profit from allowances which they receive from the taxpayer? in this case they very clearly are.' mr jackson said: 'all british citizens are entitled . to seek legal adjudication if the state’s actions are unfair or possibly . illegal and so i will be forcefully resisting their precipitous . litigation.' martin bell, a former mp, said mps should repay any profit they made on their properties . he disputes ipsa's assessment that the family home in his constituency rose in value by 20 per cent from 2010 to 2012, claiming house prices in the area actually fell by three per cent. 'at . my own expense, i have paid for an accurate recent expert valuation and . i have made a reasonable offer to ipsa to settle the matter and reduce . the legal costs which will have to be met by the taxpayer. 'my . valuation recognises the need for proper recompense to be paid to the . taxpayer to reflect their support for my housing costs between 2010 and . 2012, in order to fulfill my duties as both a london based legislator . and a constituency mp. 'ipsa . have negotiated with 70 other mps in a secretive and arbitrary manner . but in respect of my case, regrettably, they have refused to negotiate. 'i am merely seeking fair play and consistency and will pursue legal action to receive it.' payback: treasury minister david gauke and former farming sir jim paice have returned thousands of pounds . an ipsa spokesman said: 'one of the . most damaging aspects of the expenses scandal was the practice where mps . got taxpayer support to own a second home. that is why we said we would . stop this, and we have now done so. 'the . final stage in bringing this to an end was our allowing a short . transition period for mps who were already committed to second . mortgages. 'but in doing . this we set the condition that the taxpayer would want its share of any . increase in the value of the property. today we are publishing that . these capital gains are worth almost £500,000 to the taxpayer. 'one of the . most damaging aspects of the expenses scandal was the practice where mps . got taxpayer support to own a second home. that is why we said we would . stop this, and we have now done so' - ipsa spokesman . 'mps . knew this was the deal and agreed to the conditions at the start. in . valuing the property, it was important that we didn't rely on amateur . valuations or guesses from the web. 'instead, . we demanded formal valuations at the start and end, from the royal . institute of chartered surveyors - the most authoritative voice in this . field. 'we would only accept valuations from rics members or fellows - providing proper assurance on the value of the properties. 'we . required all mps to provide these independent valuations at the start . and end of the claim period. and we published the way in which the . capital gain would be calculated. the same method of calculation has . been applied to all 71 cases. 'stewart . jackson provided us with two rics valuations. as he has been unwilling . to pay the £54,000 due we have issued proceedings to recover the sum . through the high court.' among . those not asked for repayments were deputy prime minister nick clegg, . who claimed £9,104 on a home in his sheffield constituency, and david . miliband, who claimed £5,903 on a property in his former seat of south . shields.

even for solo journeys . that is more than eight times the cost of an open return national express coach journey at £39.50 and enough to pay for a family of four flying on ryanair to barcelona (£184) or athens (£240). it would also pay for a flight to rome on norwegian air (£240), or a single traveller flying to new york for £334 with kuwait airways. the fare findings follow a damning report this week by rail watchdogs showing that rail travellers have registered the lowest level of satisfaction with the railways in five years. they were annoyed by overcrowded, expensive and late-running services. in january fares rose across all types of tickets by an average of 2.2 per cent. but season tickets went up by 2.5 per cent – not only well above the consumer prices index (cpi) inflation figure but also in excess of most annual pay rises. customer dissatisfaction has been compounded by anger over ‘fat cat bonuses’ awarded to rail chiefs, which have been branded ‘rewards for failure’. expensive: the comparison was carried out 20 years after the privatisation of the railways in britain . return tickets pre-booked . £41   barcelona . £53   athens . £62   rome . £94   marrakech . £95   dubrovnik . £150  st petersburg . £282  dubai . £334  new york . source: skyscanner . barry doe, an independent fares expert, was commissioned to carry out research on rising ticket prices by the transport salaried staffs association (tssa) union. his research shows that an open return rail ticket between london and bristol has soared by 246 per cent – from £57 to £197. the anytime fare from the capital to liverpool has jumped by 232 per cent from £93 to £309, while to cardiff it has increased by 211 per cent from £70 to £218. this makes cars a cost-effective alternative to rail travel – especially for families. aa president edmund king said: ‘for the cost of my annual rail season ticket – a painful £4,028 – i could buy a second-hand car for £1000, tax and insure it and still have enough to pay for 20,000 miles of petrol, which is two years’ motoring for the average driver.’ a spokesman for virgin trains defended the £329 return anytime fare from london to manchester, noting that a fraction of travellers paid it and most chose from a range of cheaper flexible options. they added: ‘over the last year the number of passengers travelling on the standard anytime fare of £164.50 one way and £329 return represented only 3.7 per cent of the journeys made between london and manchester. an open return to edinburgh even with nationalised east coast costs £313 - up from £130 two decades ago . many of our advanced fares from manchester remained the same or came down in january – overall our fares increased by 1.4 per cent which is significantly below the industry average.’ a spokesman for the rail delivery group, which represents network rail and train operators, said: ‘the tssa’s figures are misleading in the extreme as they deliberately focus only on the most expensive fares. on average, the cost of rail travel has increased by 6 per cent in real terms over the last 15 years. ‘this helps explain why passenger numbers have almost doubled over the period, contributing to a fivefold increase in money going back to reinvest in a better railway.’ but labour’s transport spokesman michael dugher said: ‘rail passengers are being let down and ripped off. things have got worse on our railways.’ and tssa general secretary manuel cortes said: ‘passengers have paid a terrible price for this political folly. the private rail industry has taken all the gain while passengers have suffered all the pain. passengers have paid a small fortune on fares while rail bosses are paid a fortune. ‘we want to end this persecution of passengers which started after privatisation.’ he added: ‘it is hardly surprising that satisfaction is falling when commuters are paying record fares for a worsening service. it is an absolute disgrace.’ [\/INST]","llama2_chat13b_completions":" # Rail fares have more than trebled in the past 20 years\n# Some open return tickets now cost more than the price of taking a family to the Mediterranean or a solo flight to New York\n# Research by Britain's leading rail fare analyst shows that fares on some of the most popular routes have increased by between 141% and 246% over the past 20 years\n# Inflation has gone up by 77% over the same period\n# Driving or flying can now be cheaper than catching the train, even for solo journeys\n# An open return ticket from London to Manchester now costs £329, up from £96 in 1995\n# An open return ticket from London to Edinburgh now costs £313, up from £130 in 1995\n# Passenger satisfaction with the railways has fallen to its lowest level in five years, with passengers angry about overcrowding, expensiveness, and late-running services\n# Rail fares have increased by an average of 6% in real terms over the last 15 years\n# The number of passengers has almost doubled over the period, contributing to a fivefold increase in money going back to reinvest in a better railway\n# Labour's transport spokesman Michael Dugher said: \"Rail passengers are being let down and ripped off.

'when the first application was taken down local people were delighted that it had gone away, but it's come back with very little adjustment. 'i understand people's frustrations.' residents say the plans, if given the go ahead will have an impact on the roads in the surrounding area . one representative for the catherine-de-barnes residents' association who has lived in the area for 31 years, but did not want to be named, said: 'there's no need for it. 'the borough has sufficient provision for the next 20 years.' leader of solihull council, conservative councillor bob sleigh, said he also agreed the needs of local people could already be met at the borough's current plots. he said: 'there is no need for this extra site in solihull. we have identified our population need and made provision for that.

'birmingham council are making some provision but we still need more in the vicinity of the population. 'don't forget, the people who came here in the 1950s and 1960s are now old and dying fast.

the neatly groomed candidate came out with a new promise. jobs! schools! better social services! a better future! he smiled broadly as the cheering swelled, wiping the sweat off his brow with a white handkerchief. he wore a freshly pressed white shirt with an open collar, under a well-cut blue blazer. he was the picture of authority and self-confidence. afterward, one of the farmers brushed off the other contenders in the presidential election as posers. \"there is no one else,\" he told me. \"the other candidates don't care about egypt. they've been hired!\" his candidate, hosni mubarak, easily won the election, back in september 2005, though there is little doubt it was rigged in his favor. it was another \"historic\" election, the first multi-candidate presidential election ever, though the challengers never had a chance against an incumbent backed by the vast resources and lack of scruples of the egyptian state. today, mubarak is under armed guard albeit in a luxury wing of a cairo hospital, awaiting the verdict from his trial in early june. much has changed since the last presidential election, but much remains the same. mubarak came from the military, and the military, in the form of the supreme council of the armed forces (scaf), still runs the country. while scaf has tried to talk the talk of the new era, all of its members rose through the ranks of the egyptian military with the blessings of hosni mubarak. according to the u.s. state department cables posted on the internet by wikileaks, midlevel egyptian army officers referred to field marshall mohamed hussein tantawi, the head of scaf, as \"mubarak's poodle.\" scaf has overseen the process that led to this presidential election, in which egyptians had the opportunity to choose their president from among 13 candidates on the ballot (although two pulled out of the race). since mubarak stepped down on february 11, 2011, scaf has stumbled from one crisis to another, reacting with violence and brutality against protesters, but often ceding ground when tahrir square filled and passions boiled. scaf has pledged to hand over executive power to a civilian president by the end of june. in theory, egypt is on the cusp of monumental change. these are heady days in egypt. everyone seems to be pontificating on politics, comparing candidates, pondering platforms. the election is everywhere. the airwaves are full of it, facebook and twitter are abuzz with it, the streets are festooned with posters and banners. on the surface it seems so different from the predictable, managed, officially sanctioned politics of the mubarak years. but the choice facing egyptians is, actually, little changed. under the old regime, hosni mubarak made it clear he was the champion of the status quo, holding back the islamist tide, led by the then-banned but tolerated muslim brotherhood. in this election, voters can choose the status quo -- with some lip service to post-revolutionary reality -- in the form of former foreign minister and later arab league secretary general amre moussa or ex-civil aviation minister and briefly prime minister ahmed shafik. or they can opt for a new islamic order, either with the full-on muslim brotherhood candidate, u.s.-educated mohamed morsi, or the islamic-lite candidate abdelmonen abol fotoh. add to the mix hamdeen sabahy, a nasserist who appeals to the leftists and the nationalists. in recent days sabahy's numbers have been rising, perhaps as a backlash against the paucity of choices among the front-runners. the establishment -- the bureaucracy, the military, the intelligence services and the business community -- clearly doesn't want to see the islamists come to power. tuesday, the semi-official cairo daily, al-akhbar, ran an ominous page-three story with the headline: \"beware of a military coup: the future will be frightening if the brotherhood reaches the summit of power.\" the source of this disturbing headline was none other than former vice president and veteran intelligence chief omar suleiman, quoted in the london pan-arab daily al-hayat. he painted a grim picture of the brotherhood setting up a revolutionary guard, along the lines of iran, to fight against the egyptian military. the military, he warned, does not know how cunning the brotherhood can be. another cairo daily ran banner headlines warning that if either of the islamist candidates wins it would be \"apocalypse now\" -- a mosaic plague of catastrophic proportions will descend upon egypt, with a breakdown in security, violence, kidnapping, thuggery and theft, massive capital flight, political isolation, unemployment, poverty, and illness. on top of all that, once the islamists have power, the paper predicted, they will murder all their political opponents. those who are opposed to the brotherhood tend to see them as forked-tongue taliban in ties, eager to impose islamic law, force women to cover up, and ban alcohol. but for egyptians struggling with rising prices and low wages, the brotherhood offers the promise of a better future. indeed, the view is not so grim among those who have received only the crumbs off the status quo's table. gamal, a bank clerk living in the old cairo district of sayida zaynab, will be voting for mohamed morsi of the brotherhood. \"the health system is in bad shape, as is education,\" he says. \"conditions for people in egypt are very, very bad.\" in the nile city of beni suef, farmer ashour darwish attended a crowded muslim brotherhood rally, eager to hear morsi speak. he supports the brotherhood, he told me, because they are champions of what matters to him: \"justice, transparency, implementation of islamic law, the plight of the poor farmers, and unemployment.\" the brotherhood's political wing, the freedom and justice party, won more than 40% of the seats in egypt's lower house of parliament in recent elections. after being hounded by the police and intelligence agencies for decades, they are finally free to operate, and aren't shy about flexing their muscles. jihad haddad, a young brotherhood member, sees no reason why the group should be shy about its power. \"we came by the vote of the people and by the choice of the people,\" he says. \"what we really want is application of real reform policies on the ground, and we can't have that opportunity if we are out of executive power.\" it would be rash at this point to make any predictions of who will actually win that executive power. the muslim brotherhood is a formidable organization that can mobilize its supporters and ensure a high turnout. they did it for the parliamentary elections and they'll doubtless be able to do it this time as well. but the prospect of both the legislative and executive branches dominated by the brotherhood worries many. magdi zaki works in the finance ministry, and voted for the brotherhood. but he feels they are novices in power, grandstanding on live broadcasts from the parliament, but doing little else. \"they have no political background,\" he says dismissive contempt, like a seasoned theatre critic dismissing a flop. polls of potential voters have been all over the place, but they do show that a majority of egyptians have yet to make up their minds. they debate the choices in taxis and buses, in the subway, in cafes, over breakfast, lunch and dinner, over twitter and on facebook, changing their minds between meals. one seasoned veteran of egyptian politicsâ€”who requested anonymityâ€”chuckled over the fickle nature of the voters, and puts it this way: \"this is the first time i've ever had people ask me, 'who do you think is going to win the presidential election?' i honestly have no idea.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat13b_completions":" #Summary of the news article:

(babycastles launched as a party alongside the blip festival, a showcase of chiptune musicians; this year's festival begins this week in new york.) meanwhile, the patrons of both of these independent communities are in one way or another striving to experience something new -- something that can't be bought in a store, but that is available for anyone to see and hear if they look in the right places. just like indie music, the independent gaming scene is trading in neat, mass-produced convenience for a rough-hewn, playful provocation. \"[at big gaming studios] games have become massive undertakings in which each developer acts like a cog. the budget for games has increased by billions of dollars, and developers don't take as much risk anymore,\" says salahuddin. \"so you see a lot of rehashed games from the same video game engine, like another \"unreal\" clone.\" the independent gaming movement \"is in response to that.\" the implications of babycastles remixing go wider than the music, art and gaming worlds. the hope, says salahuddin, is to build a kind of economy for independent gaming developers outside the large studios, something akin to what supports indie musicians who make much of their money through touring and merchandise. babycastles' other mission is to bring an obscured world of hobbyist game development to a larger audience -- a public that may be jaded with a culture often built on testosterone-fueled first-person shooters, or that tends to roll its eyes at the premise of games altogether. it's a formidable challenge, but, as the gallery's raucous and diverse gatherings prove, one that isn't so hard to beat. still, mixing games with the underground music scene can have its downside too -- some musicians who come to play fall in love with the games in the basement, salahuddin says. \"so bands started missing their sets.\" [\/INST]","llama2_chat13b_completions":" # Summary\n\nBabycastles is an underground arcade in Brooklyn that showcases independent video games and chiptune music.

'i've thought about killing myself many times,' won said in a recent interview at her small apartment in gunpo, just south of seoul. she has two big strikes against her. there are allegations that she was merely a low-level informant whose deeds were inflated by south korean officials eager to make pyongyang look bad, and by reporters digging for a sexy story. additionally, the sexual nature of her crimes carries a stigma in this conservative country. the sexual nature of won jeong-hwa's crimes carries a stigma in conservative south korea . won was imprisoned in 2008 after a court ruled that she posed as an ordinary north korean defector, then used sex to extract secrets from south korean military officers. the media began calling her 'north korea's mata hari' in reference to an exotic dancer from the netherlands who used sex to obtain military secrets during world war i. north korea accused south korea of cooking up a spy scandal to tarnish pyongyang's image and said won was a criminal. after won was released, she was a popular guest on tv talk shows where she spoke about her harsh, elite spy training. she said she disobeyed pyongyang's orders to assassinate two south korean army intelligence officers with poison. she also talked about how she fell in love with a junior army officer - the \"man of my life.\" he was later imprisoned for passing her secrets including a list of north korean defectors even after learning she was a spy. the attention caused south korean media to revisit her case. some reporters questioned the value of her espionage work, and raised suspicions based on testimony by north korean defectors who said they knew won and her family members in the north. won's 2008 court verdict said she was trained at a special operations unit in pyongyang and was a daughter of an agent killed on a spy mission in south korea in 1974. but won's stepfather, kim dong-soon, who came to south korea in 2007, said in an interview that won's biological father was an ordinary laborer who died of a heart attack, and that won was a high school dropout who had nothing to do with special operations forces. won denies kim's allegations. in the verdict and in interviews, it was said that north korea first sent won to south korea in 2001 to take photos of the exteriors of u.s. military installations and to collect south korean newspaper editorials about north korea. people dubious of won's elite status consider that low-level spy work. some defectors who met won before her 2008 arrest say she was often incoherent and unprofessional and could not have been a highly trained spy. 'i believe that she was exploited as an informant. ... she wasn't even worth being called a spy,' said kim yong-hwa, a defector-turned-activist. he said he once rejected won's request to meet with a high-profile north korean defector because she rambled too much. a key debunker of won's espionage record is won herself. she has said in media interviews that she was pressured by prosecutors to provide false testimony, particularly about her use of sex in spy work. 98128 . 67710 . 92346 . 56262 . 78275 . 87600 . 19854 . 128360 . 130080 . 62439 . 152741 . 80640 . 73840 . 79599 . 140928 . 80481 . 81549 . 125992 . life: won jeong-hwa said she once disobeyed pyongyang's orders to assassinate two south korean army intelligence officers with poison. she also said she fell in love with a junior officer in the south korean army . the trial verdict and an investigation by prosecutors said she slept with numerous men, including south korean officers and her boss at an agency where she worked. won said she used sex as a spying tool only once, to steal personnel management-related documents from an army major's home computer. she said she couldn't resist pressure by prosecutors who gave her alcohol and urged her to confess during questioning. they \"manufactured (the story of) my relations with men,\" she said. 'i'm not a mata hari.' prosecutors have dismissed won's claims. south korea has a history of forgiving former spies and assassins, though they are still sometimes ostracized. their careers in the media often depend on whether they were involved in high-profile cases that captured global attention, and whether they followed seoul's propaganda line against the north. won said a prosecutor told her during her questioning that she could make a new start in the south by following in the footsteps of kim hyon-hui, a north korean agent sentenced to death for bombing a south korean jet in 1987, killing all 115 passengers aboard. kim was later pardoned and wrote a best-selling autobiography. she often appears on tv to speak critically of north korea. several other north koreans who once attacked the south now embrace it. previous life: while working undercover for north korea's late dictator kim jong-il, won jeong-hwa would steal sex secret about his rivals in the south . one of the 31 north korean commandos who launched a brazen mission to assassinate south korea's president in 1968 is now a christian pastor who lectures about the north. a north korean crew member of a submarine that ran aground in the south, and who was captured alive after a massive manhunt that left 25 other comrades dead or missing, is a lecturer for the south korean navy. a spy arrested after a deadly shootout in 1995 works for a think tank run by the south's spy agency and wrote a book about his mission. won, on the other hand, feels trapped. no south korean tv station wants her as an expert because of reports that she may not have been an elite spy. finding work unrelated to her past is also impossible, she said, because no one wants to hire an unskilled woman with a criminal espionage record. one of the jobs she gained and quickly lost was at a noodle restaurant. she said a former colleague later told her the boss had been worried she would poison the food. the army officer won fell in love with has been released, but they are no longer in touch. nor is the father of her 12-year-old daughter in the picture: she said he is a south korean businessman she met in china, where she had been assigned to find and repatriate north korean defectors before she was sent to south korea. won said the government assistance she gets was not enough for her to even buy a school uniform for her daughter. a center that helps female ex-inmates gave one to her. many defectors shun her. she said her neighbors once asked that she move, and that her daughter's friends have been told by their parents to stay away from the girl.

And one day, you'll get on a bus and head out west, like I said before. You will end up living on the island called Manhattan with a man you marry. He'll become a writer, and you'll have two children who will be the loves of your life.\"\n\"Then you will get divorced and be happy about it, because he was a drunk and a philanderer. And then one day, the two of you, this man and me, I mean, we will both, separately, decide to get on buses and come to this town where we both were born, and where we were both afraid to come back to. And that's the story: I've seen your life, and it's all that I've told you.\"\nWe sat quiet for a while, and then I said, \"But how did you know it was me? How did you know that I was the little girl you told the story to, all those years ago?\"\nHe thought for a moment, and then he said, \"Because I can see the future, of course.\" And then he smiled, and gave me a little wink, and I smiled back at him, because I knew that he was joking. But then a funny thought occurred to me. What if he really could see the future? What if everything he'd just said to me was true, and my life would turn out exactly that way? The idea both thrilled and terrified me at the same time, and as I looked around at all the faces in the diner, I realized that I wasn't sure which were the ghosts and which were the living people. What a strange place this was, I thought, and for a moment, it almost felt like home.\nWe went on talking like that for the rest of the meal, him asking questions about my life and me answering them as best I could, until we were the last patrons left in the diner. I suppose it might sound strange, but I almost wish the night had gone on forever, with the old man and me sitting together, eating pie and talking about the future.\nIt is hard to know what to say after a story like that, but when the old man and I finally got up to leave, I decided to ask him one last question.\n\"Do you really think the future is written?\" I said. \"That everything we do is already determined, like the lines on a map?\"\n\"I don't know about that,\" he said slowly, \"but I do know this: the past is always with us, and it can be a heavy weight if we let it be. But if we take the time to learn from it, if we try to understand where we came from, then maybe we can find a way to move on. And in the end, that's all any of us can really do: just try to keep moving forward, one step at a time, and hope that we end up somewhere better than where we started.\""}

{"id":"story-3","prompt_1":"continue the story: it all happened so suddenly''","beluga70bQ_completions":" (p. 13). I have omitted parts of a sentence above, so let me try again to read this paragraph with attention to its rhetoric: ''The whole series of events is so sudden and short that if someone should try to write about them, describing them in detail, his composition will inevitably seem to him disorganized and incoherent, as if he were trying to continue the story: it all happened so suddenly'' (p. 13). The first sentence of the paragraph, which I've quoted in my summary, introduces the problem (the story is too sudden, too short, to be told in coherent prose), but the rest of the paragraph explores that problem in a number of ways. The narrator's reference to the ''composition'' (in Greek, the term used here, sunthesis, means any sort of combining or putting together, but in later Greek it often comes to mean \"composition,\" as we might use it today when talking about literary works) shows that he's thinking not only of what happened but also of how it can be recounted and how that recounting is difficult. Later in the paragraph, the narrator seems to refer to this same difficulty, as he says, ''if someone should try to write about them, describing them in detail, his composition will inevitably seem to him disorganized and incoherent'' (emphasis added).\nBut the key terms for me are not just a term that means composition, they are also the adjectives ''disorganized'' and 'incoherent'. The adjective translated as ''disorganized'' is atopos, and it comes from the prefix a + topo\/s, meaning ''no place'' or ''no order.'' (Topos, by itself, is a term used frequently in Greek philosophy to denote the proper place, the right location, or the appropriate organization.) So the translation of atopos as disorganized suggests that the story is so sudden and fleeting that it cannot find its proper place in a narrative; it lacks a location within a narrative structure. In the story of Icarus, that lack of organization becomes palpable, as the narrative jumps from the gift to Icarus and his brief flight to his catastrophic fall without pausing to examine the causal sequence among these events. Similarly, the term translated as ''incoherent'' (anekdunamos) comes from a prefix meaning \"un\" plus the verb kdunaw, which means \"to stop\" or \"to gather.\" So the term suggests that the sudden events can't be gathered together adequately within the narrative process; it's possible that they are, as the narrator suggests, too rapid to be captured by narrative conventions or, if they are captured, they will be disorganized within the narrative, not appropriately stopped. The narrator's frustration is evident, not only with the suddenness that characterizes human life but also with the challenge of composing a narrative that can convey this suddenness.\nBy contrast, the narrator's attitude seems more confident when it comes to the other, longer narrative he'll tell. ''Though my age makes it difficult and keeps me from saying much, I'll keep my attention on what I'm about to say, looking forward all the while to that time when I shall be able to describe the story with some clarity. For the tale ahead is not so short that I couldn't tell it'' (p. 17). The difference in narrative pace seems to reassure the narrator. In the longer story, he is confident that he can compose a \"cohesive\" narrative; the longer narrative duration and its clarity make him feel much less anxious, as they allow him the proper time and the right materials to construct a narrative.\nBut this is no ordinary narrative; it is one that draws heavily from philosophical reflection along with aesthetic practice. Here is what Ovid says about his project: ''I thought I should compose a continuous poem [continuum poem] about the origin and development of the world up to our own time'' (p. 18). Note that he uses a philosophical term, \"continuum,\" to describe the character of the continuous narrative he wants to compose, and it is not incidental that the term \"poem\" appears so soon after that; for, indeed, Ovid has not left behind his skills as a poet but rather has found new ways to apply those skills. Further, he notes that his poem will encompass \"the origin and development of the world up to our own time\" (p. 18). The scope of this project is vast, encompassing all of human history and all of natural history, too. It is a project of encyclopedic proportions.\nBut what is most striking to"}

There is a bit of snow on the ground, the first snowfall of the season. There is no moon, only the reflected city lights providing the path. The lamplights themselves are bright enough that the snow reflects a faint blue. There are no stars; the sky is black like a thick blanket over the city.\nYou walk through campus, past the buildings, the statues that watch you. All the classroom lights are turned out; only the lamps around the walkways give any sense of life in the dark. They provide just enough light for you to make your way through campus without tripping over anything.\nYour breath comes in plumes, like smoke trails from your mouth. The cold seeps into your shoes, chilling your feet like ice. You bundle your collar around your neck, pulling it close as you walk. It feels like the wind wants to tear your clothes away; it wants to rip your skin and take your breath away. The air is thick, wet, and heavy.\nAs you round a corner, you see a familiar building, the one you always go to in between classes for a quick study. A small circle of light on the ground marks the entrance.

You wonder if he’s homeless and finds warmth in the library, or if he’s a student like you, trying to study through the night to beat a deadline.\nAs you make your way inside, it feels like going into a cocoon. Warm air envelops you, offering a brief respite from the cold. The library is quiet; there are no other students.\nYou walk to the back shelves, where it’s dark and cozy.

You sit in one of the plush chairs, which smells of old leather, and open your book.\nThe shelves are lined with books, hundreds of them, and you think about how many worlds they contain. All of history is at your fingertips, along with countless imagined universes. You pick up an old, tattered book and open it to a random page. Words jump out at you:\n“And then, at last, the silence was broken…”\nYou settle in for the night, lost in a world of words.\nIn conclusion, writing a story based on specific prompts can be a great way to explore your creativity and push yourself to create something new.

When he walks, his big legs move like two massive columns, like two skyscrapers shifting in the earth. At times, this movement causes the ground to shake under him, creating the appearance of an earthquake. People who don't know him are cautious around him for fear of being overshadowed. He is always hungry and ready to be fed. His heart is as big as his appetite.\nThe story began when our hero woke up one day to find that his neighborhood was devoid of any food. There were no stores or markets, and even the food stalls had vanished. He wandered through the streets, desperately searching for something to eat, but nothing was to be found. As he walked along, he bumped into a few people, and they too were searching for food. They banded together, and MrBennyJ became their leader, for he was the greatest among them and all looked up to him.\nThe group traveled through the wasteland that was their city, searching for any source of sustenance. They endured the harsh sun and battled through fierce storms, but their efforts were in vain. On the verge of surrender, MrBennyJ looked down at his empty stomach. In that moment, he made a vow to himself and his newfound friends: he would not rest until he had found a way to feed his people.\nThus began his quest to find food. He journeyed far and wide, his massive legs carrying him across vast distances each day. As he walked, his giant shadow covered the land, providing some small comfort to those he encountered. He faced many challenges along the way, battling vicious predators and traversing treacherous terrain. MrBennyJ never faltered, for his hunger drove him forward, demanding to be satisfied.\nAfter many months, he finally arrived at the end of his journey. A great valley lay before him, filled with lush green fields and bustling towns. It was a land of plenty, where food was abundant and the people were well-fed. MrBennyJ smiled, for he had found what he had been searching for. In that moment, he knew that his quest had not been in vain. His journey had taught him the importance of perseverance, and in the face of adversity, he had stood tall, literally and figuratively.\nMrBennyJ and his friends made their way through the valley, sharing their story with anyone who would listen. Word quickly spread of their incredible journey, and soon they were hailed as heroes. People flocked to them, asking for their help in rebuilding their own cities once again. With their newfound knowledge and strength, MrBennyJ and his friends set to work, transforming the wasteland into a thriving paradise.\nFrom that day forward, MrBennyJ became a legend, known far and wide for his dedication and heroism. He continued to eat large meals, but his appetite was now driven by a greater purpose: to ensure that no one would ever go hungry again. And with each step he took, his massive shadow cast a protective veil over all who followed in his footsteps."}
{"id":"story-6","prompt_1":"continue the story: when the hero becomes the villain","beluga70bQ_completions":", what happens next? Will the legendary Fire Lord, K’nuckles, be able to get his mojo back? Will there be enough of a rationale for this game to justify its existence alongside its far superior predecessor? We are here to explore these questions today. But before we do so, let’s take a quick look at the original, The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night.\nSpyro: The Eternal Night was a very fun game in its day, and is still great now when you look at the whole picture. But the fact that it was based on a somewhat popular yet ultimately mediocre game series called the Legend of Spyro was not a very good thing, as it meant that many of its ideas and gameplay elements were carried over from the old games – something that has been happening to a lot of other popular franchises in the past few years too. The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night offered an interesting and fairly balanced story, some great gameplay mechanics, and more or less decent visuals for its time. It wasn’t perfect, but it was an enjoyable game that fans of the series should definitely check out.\nHowever, the story in The Legend of Spyro 2: K’Nuckles’ Quest is a mixed bag. First off, the game introduces a completely new character in the series – one that has never been seen before, and whose personality has to be fleshed out in a significantly unique way due to the game’s premise. This does not mean that the new character is an instant success, because the same applies to virtually every other character in the game, including the old favorites (the dragons), but it does add an interesting and somewhat exciting element to the story. Unfortunately, it also means that fans of the original characters (the ones in The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night) may find that their favorite characters don’t have much of a role to play in this installment – although this isn’t really that big of a deal, since most of the gameplay is built around using your familiar characters from the first installment as well.\nOn the positive side, The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night offered a unique twist on the classic action\/adventure gameplay formula. Instead of featuring a huge world full of colorful and bizarre enemies (the norm for most games of this genre nowadays), The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night instead focused on a smaller, more focused world, populated with various interesting creatures, all of whom had to be hunted down and killed in order to proceed through the game. This resulted in extremely engaging and memorable gameplay that was both challenging and engaging at the same time. The only drawback of this gameplay style was that the game had a limited number of areas in which players could explore, as the map itself was quite small – something that was common for games of this era.\nThe story in The Legend of Spyro 2: K’Nuckles’ Quest takes place immediately after the events of The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night. After the evil Dark Master has finally been defeated, dragons return to the land of Avalar to rebuild their world. Unfortunately, they encounter a new threat in the form of a powerful and deadly pirate lord named K’nuckles. To stop K’nuckles from plundering their valuable treasure, Spyro, K’nuckles, and a new dragon team up to use their skills to thwart the menace.\nAlthough the story is quite interesting and engaging, The Legend of Spyro 2: K’nuckles’ Quest has a major drawback when it comes to using the same formula as its predecessor. The game’s world is simply too small and limited, which can cause gameplay issues when trying to explore the world using your familiar characters from the original. This can lead to repetitive gameplay, and players may find themselves becoming bored quickly and quitting the game before it really has a chance to shine.\nThere are a few other issues with the game as well. While the graphics are still quite good compared to its predecessor, it lacks some of the extra features that made the first game so engrossing and memorable. For example, the cutscenes in The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night were beautifully illustrated, and they added a nice sense of depth to the gameplay; but in this sequel, the cutscenes are severely lacking in quality. Additionally, the game’s control scheme is also a bit outdated and clunky, which can make it difficult to navigate the various areas in the game.\nDespite these few drawbacks, The Legend of Spyro 2: K’"}

If it's hard to follow the plot, if the characters are confusing or just plain unlikable, if the story moves too slowly, if the prose is overly dense or clumsy, I've got no problem closing it and moving on to the next one.

Sometimes a book that's clearly a genre exercise simply doesn't offer me anything new or fresh within its pages, and I'm happy to abandon it.\nOften, of course, the problem with a bad book can be traced to sloppy editing (if it's been edited at all). Typos, factual errors, inconsistencies, poor formatting, and grammatical errors can all combine to make a book hard to read and frustrating to attempt to review. If you're going to ask people to pay money for your work, it seems reasonable that the work should be as polished and well-crafted as you can make it. But every week I seem to run across books that are self-published or from small presses that seem to have been dashed off with little or no editing or revising.\nSo those are a few things that can make a book bad.

{"id":"story-9","prompt_1":"continue the story: humans do not inhabit the earth.","beluga70bQ_completions":" Instead, the story opens up to other forms of life altogether: it is the wild animals with whom we share the earth. The animals are the focus – specifically, wild animals on land and on sea, ranging from mammals to invertebrates and including plants for completeness. This is the subject of “The Book of Life” where humans do indeed share, but not as the protagonist.\nThe book of life is also called genome, DNA or Book of Genes and provides us with the most accurate story of life on Earth as it is written by life itself. This book is found in cells of every living creature on Earth. When we want to “read” this book, we search for similarities and differences between the genes of the organisms we study. The more similar the genes are to one another, the more recent is the time of their divergence (think of them as distant relatives speaking different languages that you, the listener, can still recognize). If they are very different, it indicates a deeper genetic history, pointing to a time when the species diverged from each other and evolved into separate lineages. The Book of Life helps provide us with a historical timeline of evolution, providing a story that unfolds into what we have around us today.\nAlthough we may be familiar with the fossil record of the dinosaurs and that of horses, we are a little less familiar with species that may have roamed this planet over 335 million years ago. And even less familiar with what happened 3.5 billion years ago. How do we even fathom time at these vast depths, let alone uncover what actually happened?\nFor that, we need to go back to the book – the DNA book of life, that is – in an attempt to capture the genetic history as accurately as possible. In doing so, we are able to see the interwoven tapestry of evolutionary histories unfolding before us.\nWe can do this by studying the commonalities and uniqueness of specific genes and compare them to the genes of other species to piece together what happened at these long lost times. Through these comparisons, we are presented with historical snapshots, frozen in time, that help us unravel the mysteries of life through scientific research. This is evolutionary biology or phylogenetics – using genes to trace lineages and evolutionary history.\nWhile we have been fascinated by life and natural history for centuries, the use of DNA as a tool is relatively new and has revolutionized biology, as it allows researchers to investigate the history of life on Earth with unprecedented resolution. The book of life is indeed fascinating to study because the stories it tells are beyond what we can observe with our naked eyes or even with a microscope.\nIn “The Book of Life,” written by the author himself, evolution is captured across various time scales, from the deep root of the tree of life 3.5 billion years ago to the diversification of plants and animals we see on Earth today. While much still remains to be revealed, the stories we uncover today will lay the foundation for our understanding of life on Earth tomorrow."}
{"id":"story-10","prompt_1":"continue the story: an ancient god\/diety dies alone.","beluga70bQ_completions":" The next story begins the story of the next god (perhaps a successor to the older god) and its own adventure. At the end of that adventure, the new god dies, in solitude. On and on it goes.\nNow this concept could work across multiple comics, but the concept of a single series that tells the tale of the rise, life and death of a god is certainly interesting. It also offers a bit of variety from the superhero-driven comics, and I've always appreciated the fantasy aspect of the world of myth.\nThe next issue of The Comedian (a four-part series from DC) comes out this week and it's a great example of putting characters in a new situation. This series is a \"What If\" tale in which the Comedian from Watchmen somehow survives the events of the Alan Moore original and finds himself in a radically different future.\nIt's an interesting concept (and one that can easily be applied to other well-known stories). What would happen if a character survived an event that should have killed him and then experienced a different (or altered) timeline?\nYou could do the same sort of thing with other comics and novels. What if Batman survived the end of The Dark Knight Rises? What if Harry Potter had died (instead of \"living\" as an undead version of himself)? You get the picture, right?\nThis is similar to what Marvel's currently doing with their \"What If\" series (a new twist on the classic title) in which characters die in one reality and then find themselves living in another, different reality. Sure, it gives Marvel an easy opportunity to tell slightly different versions of the same stories, but as a concept, it's definitely worth exploring.\nWhich character would you like to see survive their \"death\" and then live in a different timeline? Let me know!\nYou know what's great? Pixie-Bobs.\nPixie-Bobs are not, as you might think, an indie rock band from the Pacific Northwest. They're actually cats that were first bred in the 1980s by crossing a domestic cat with a bobcat. To be honest, it sounds like a bad idea, but it actually produced a pretty cool animal. You can read more about Pixie-Bobs here.\nFor the sake of this blog's focus, I'm going to suggest that perhaps one of the descendants of such a cat became enhanced with a mystical ability, which turned this particular Pixie-Bob to a superhero. What kind of powers might a cat with a little bit of bobcat blood possess? How about a cat with a lot of bobcat blood?\nMight the cat develop super-speed or perhaps a powerful roar? What about super-stiff hairs like a hedgehog? The possibilities are endless. And you can bet the supervillain will be a dog.\nHere's a concept I stole: What if there was a town full of supernaturally enhanced cats (and other animals)? A town filled with cute little kittens, but kittens with a darker side (or just a side capable of wrecking your curtains or scratching your furniture or knocking over your coffee table). Maybe it's a new take on a \"furry\" kind of story. Or maybe it's a parody of The Sopranos.\nPerhaps every year, the town has a day of festivities known only to them where they celebrate their enhanced abilities, and perhaps at night they have their own version of \"battle cats\" in which they team up to take on a much larger enemy. Maybe they're just a town filled with cute little kittens who are always ready to paw at your ankles.\nWhatever it is, be sure to add a dog as the antagonist.\nThis is a simple concept, but it might make for a fun (albeit short) series. I would call this series \"Fashion Vigilante.\"\nIn this world, a fashion designer who witnesses a mugging takes it upon herself to clean up the streets. Armed with her skills, she designs clothing that has hidden abilities for fighting crime or perhaps just distracting criminals (like a cape that can turn into a net). Her goal is to make the city safer for everyone, but she's not above using her designs to make a fashion statement.\nMaybe her fashion shows double as crime-fighting events, where she and her models take on whatever villains they can find. Or maybe she designs costumes for other heroes as well. Whatever the case, she's the fashion vigilante, and she's here to make the city safer and more"}

{"id":"story-12","prompt_1":"continue the story: you are happiness in human form.","beluga70bQ_completions":" People are happy when they're around you, even if they can't seem to explain why. And this quality, this happiness, is what keeps you young. But there is something inside of you, the sadness from long ago, that you are afraid to let it out. You have seen people change when you have faced it, and so you never let it out in front of others. It's buried deep inside, waiting for the right moment when it can show itself and you'll know what to do with it.\nD: That's good. What else can you tell me?\nH: You are loved by many. Loved and respected. People admire your courage and strength. They look up to you, and they're inspired by you. You have a way of making people feel good about themselves. I see you surrounded by people who care for you, who support you, and they're there to remind you of how great you are. You have the power to make a difference in people's lives. You can teach them, guide them, and show them how to be happy, just like you are. And when they see you happy, they'll want to be happy too. They'll want to be around you, and they'll want to learn from you. And that's how your happiness will spread, from one person to another, from one generation to another, and it will become a part of people's lives. And that's your legacy.\nD: I like that. What else do you see?\nH: I see you in different places, in different times. You're a teacher, a healer, a writer, an artist, a leader, a friend. You're always learning, always growing, always evolving. You have many gifts, and you share them with the world. You light up the lives of those around you, and you leave a trail of happiness and joy wherever you go.\nD: That's amazing. What else can you tell me about my life, my purpose?\nH: I see you creating a community, a safe space where people can come together, share their stories, and find hope. Where they can learn, heal, and grow. You have a talent for connecting people, for making them feel like they belong. You understand that everyone has a story, everyone has a purpose, and your job is to help them find it.\nD: That's beautiful. Anything else?\nH: I see your influence spreading far and wide. You're like a ripple on the water, your kindness and your happiness touching countless lives. And as your happiness spreads, so does the world become a happier place. It's a never ending cycle, and you're a vital part of it. That's who you are, and that's what you were destined to do. You're here to spread happiness and make the world a better place, one smile at a time.\nD: Thank you for that. I can't wait to do it."}

{"id":"story-14","prompt_1":"continue the story: write the way you normally talk.","beluga70bQ_completions":" If you never use the words 'amigo' or'siesta' in conversation, they have no business in your text. Don't try to imitate Hispanic writers. We've all been there, done that, and bought the tequila shot. But this is what I mean: if you're Hispanic and you have something to say, you can now reach an audience that will respond, and you can take part in a discussion that began long before you. If that's not opportunity I don't know what is. Of course, the same goes for all other minority groups - it's an opportunity not only for the writers but also for the readers, who are constantly seeking out new experiences.\nI believe we're not writing in a vacuum any more and this is good because it makes writers more self-conscious about the themes they choose to discuss and the language they employ; it forces them to rethink their view of the world and its representation. And because many of the writers are new, they'll inject fresh energy into the literary world: they've grown up in a different place, with different sensibilities, and that makes for a new perspective on old themes. Of course, that doesn't mean that everything that minority writers do, from now until the end of time, will be wonderful and groundbreaking. It means, though, that they'll help expand the literary horizon, and in a world that is increasingly globalised (for better or for worse), that's necessary, and more than a little exciting.\nIn a way, the emergence and importance of Hispanic writers in the US is a natural consequence of demographics: Hispanics form the largest ethnic group in the US after white Americans. They're young, and they're eager to express themselves, and now they're getting a chance to do so. As a literary agent I've been privileged to see this evolution first-hand and it has been fascinating and gratifying. So yes, it is a golden age for Hispanic writing in the United States, and if you're a writer, it is indeed a great time to be alive.\nNatasha Wimmer is a literary translator who has brought the works of authors such as Mario Vargas Llosa and Roberto Bolaño to English. A graduate of Yale University, she is the recipient of an NEA Translation Fellowship.

The quote is also a fitting description for an artist who is so passionate about her work. She started her own record label, Good Music, in 2019. The label's roster includes Big Sean, John Legend, and Pusha T.\nThe star's debut album, \"Whore,\" was released on August 9. The album also features her hit song \"Niggas in Paris.\" As she gained attention with her unique rapping style, JAY-Z and Kanye West were among those who signed the artists' debut songs. During these early years, she was not yet well-known for her social justice activism or her feminist views, making her a unique voice in the music industry. It was later revealed that Ye co-wrote \"Through the Wire,\" which included lines from Taylor Swift's \"Diamonds.\"\nWhile the first album from Good Music is a success, it is still her second major release. Her debut album was successful, but she had more to offer than that. It was her second album that broke barriers and made her an international star. In fact, she was the first rapper to have a female backing. She has continued to produce hits and is well known for her social justice work. In addition to her music, she has a strong message that resonates with millions of people.\nA 32-year-old man has been charged with murder following the brutal murder of his 14-month-old son.

{"id":"story-16","prompt_1":"continue the story: but why shoot the janitor?''","beluga70bQ_completions":"\n\nThe man's question was met by a stony silence. I saw that everyone was looking at me. It was clear that the story was supposed to be about the janitor and so they were wondering if there might be a significance that I had missed in this aspect of it. I felt a great swell of confusion engulf me. I had, indeed, missed its significance because I had completely forgotten which character I was meant to be portraying. I could not now remember my role in the story.\n\nMy confusion must have shown itself on my face for the man with the gun now turned to me and asked for clarification. At that moment it occurred to me that this was part of the story: he only knew me as the janitor, but I did not know who I was. I did not want to spoil the story by explaining what had happened to me after being sent into the building, so I decided that it was best to invent a reason for my absence of memory and act as though I were trying to piece together the sequence of events like a character in an amnesia movie.\n\nThe man allowed this and continued with the story, now focusing on a new aspect of the tale: a romance. As he described the budding relationship between the protagonist and the female janitor, I noticed that the other characters were still in the room observing the storytelling process, but they were also playing supporting roles in the story itself. These were people like the security guard, the receptionist and an office worker who, it transpired, had been working late that night and had witnessed the whole thing unfold. None of these characters would have been described as main players in the story, but they were all there, in the background, adding a touch of realism as the story unfolded.\n\nAs I listened to the story, I noticed that the narrative was becoming more and more involved. What had started as a simple tale about a man going into a building now had many different characters, plots and subplots. And yet, despite this complexity, the man who was telling the story managed to keep the narrative on track, always ensuring that the different aspects remained coherent and linked together - so much so that, at one point, I began to wonder whether this story was scripted. It seemed too well-structured and planned out to be entirely impromptu.\n\nI then looked around the room and realised that everyone else was equally engrossed in the story. They seemed to be hanging on the man's every word, completely focused on the events that were unfolding. This, in turn, made me appreciate the story on a deeper level, not just as a piece of entertainment, but as a work of art. The way the man was able to develop the different characters, build tension and maintain the audience's attention was a testament to his skill as a storyteller.\n\nAs the story reached its conclusion, it became clear that the man with the gun had not intended to kill the female janitor, but to protect her from someone who wanted to harm her. The hero, having now discovered the truth, managed to save her and apprehend the villain. In the end, the room erupted in applause as the story reached its satisfying conclusion.\n\nI could not help but feel a sense of admiration and awe at the man who had told the story. He had managed to create a world that was both complex and engrossing, and he had done so with a skill that I could only dream of possessing. As the characters dispersed and the room gradually emptied, I knew that the memory of that night would stay with me for a long time to come.\n"}

{"id":"story-18","prompt_1":"continue the story: two mods enter, one mod leaves.","beluga70bQ_completions":"\nSo, this guy, right\nThis was back in the good ole days of 2005, when I was doing my mod, Wastelands of Eden. It's not a great mod, but it was my first one and I'm proud of it. Also, at the time I was doing this for fun and just to see if I could build something from scratch. I was using the Oblivion tools, so I also found myself frequently visiting the Bethesda Forums where I saw someone was looking for help getting a mod done. He was really bad at scripting, but had the idea, and resources, so I agreed to help. Turned out that he lived relatively nearby, in Virginia, so I thought it would be fun to drive over and meet him, have a face to face talk about the mod and play some Oblivion.\nThis is the guy we are talking about. We'll call him Jim Bob, because that's a good American name, and it's also the name I've used countless times for other people, so why not.\nJim Bob is an older guy, maybe late 40s or early 50s and has a bit of a belly. He always wears jeans and some kind of a camo shirt. He lives in an apartment that's a bit dirty. The first thing we do when I get there is fire up some Oblivion co-op and play for a bit - which was always fun in a game that was not really designed for multiplayer.\nAfter a couple of hours playing, we decide to order some pizza and have a talk about the mod while we eat. We are deep in mod-talk when Jim Bob suddenly says, \"Hey, I'll be right back, I need to use the bathroom.\"\n\"Sure, go ahead, I'll keep playing while you're out. \" I reply, and get back to playing.\nAbout 20 or 30 seconds after Jim Bob leaves the room, I hear the toilet flush in the bathroom. I think to myself, \"Huh, he must have REALLY had to go\", and get back to playing.\nAnother few seconds pass, and I suddenly hear something strange coming from the bathroom - something that made me freeze.\nI heard Jim Bob talking. He was talking to himself.\nNot really saying anything, just talking. It was a low, monotone voice like when you're talking to a 2 year old. \"Bubbles are fun. Bubbles make you happy. Squeaky toys are fun. Squeaky toys make you happy.\"\nNow, I'm not a doctor, but as a layman, this was NOT normal. And just like that, he stopped talking and comes out of the bathroom like nothing had happened. We resumed our conversation about the mod after he apologized for taking a bit longer than expected in the bathroom.\nThe moment passes, but something just felt very \"off\". I kept thinking about the talking while I was playing and eating pizza. I finally decided that perhaps it was time to wrap things up, because I had a long drive back home ahead of me. I could tell Jim Bob was a bit upset that I didn't want to stay longer, but I said that I had some things to do and had to get back home. I left his apartment and started the long drive home.\nI didn't think much about the talking thing over the next few weeks, although I did keep an eye on my backseat just in case Jim Bob decided to hitch a ride back home with me. After a couple of weeks, I got an email from Jim Bob. In it, he said that he needed some help with some more advanced scripting in the mod, and offered to pay me to work for him for a weekend. It was really good money and I needed it, so I agreed to go back to his apartment to help him out.\nThat morning, I drove to his apartment and found he was a bit more prepared for my visit. He had pizza and soda waiting for us and we started working on the advanced scripting. While I was working, I could hear him in the other room, talking to himself again. \"Squeaky toys are fun. Bubbles are fun.\" I could feel my skin crawl as I kept working on the modding.\nFinally, after about 4 hours of working, I decided I had enough. I told Jim Bob I was done for the day, and would finish up in the morning. He seemed a bit miffed, but agreed, so I left the apartment, got in my car and started driving\nI didn't get very far, because just as I was leaving the parking lot, I heard a knocking on the passenger window of my car"}
{"id":"story-19","prompt_1":"continue the story: two depressed people fall in love","beluga70bQ_completions":" and begin to make out in the bathroom of a dive bar before discovering that each is actually an assassin assigned to kill the other. No, it’s not a far-flung fantasy, it’s the premise of new romantic comedy “Mr. Right” starring Anna Kendrick and Samuel L. Jackson that debuts in theaters on Friday. The film centers on the relationship between Martha (Kendrick) and Francis (Jackson) as it unfolds over the span of one night.\nHere’s eight of the most memorable movies featuring characters who fall in love with someone on their hit list.\nStarring: Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie\nPlot: A bored married couple gets re-energized by learning that they're both secretly working as spies -- and on opposing sides.\nWhy It Works: It's rare for two people to have the same job, let alone both be working in the cutthroat world of international espionage. It's even more rare for those people to fall in love, get married and then find out that they work on opposite sides of the law -- but that's the exact premise of this action-pack trapped romantic comedy starring real-life couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.\nStarring: Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams\nPlot: A rich and passionate young man falls in love with a poor and optimistic girl, but the two are quickly separated due to their different social classes.\nWhy It Works: Starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, “The Notebook” is easily one of the most beloved romance films of all time. The movie starts with the pair sharing a passionate summer romance before being torn apart by social differences, with Rachel’s character returning to her family and Ryan’s character going off to fight in World War II. They eventually reunite in the final scene of the film that leaves viewers wondering: is it fact, or is it fiction?\n3. \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\"\nStarring: Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Vince Vaughn\nPlot: A married couple, both of whom are secretly assassins, find their professional and personal lives becoming entangled.\nWhy It Works: Another Brad Pitt love story, “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” is perhaps one of the biggest examples of two characters falling in love with each other -- who just so happen to be assassins. The movie stars Pitt and Angelina Jolie as a bored and unhappily married couple, who wind up being sent by their respective companies to kill each other. Instead, they end up rediscovering their love for each other throughout the film.\n4. \"The Last Legion\"\nStarring: Colin Firth, Aishwarya Rai\nPlot: While fighting for the Roman Empire, a commander falls in love with his Celtic prisoner, unaware that she is the last survivor of an ancient tribe of female warriors.\nWhy It Works: Colin Firth stars as a Roman legionary commander in this action-packed film who falls in love with Aishwarya Rai's Celtic character, all while being charged with protecting the soon-to-be Roman Emperor. The film is largely based on historical fiction so the love story is something that will be largely appreciated by fans of the genre.\n5. \"Alexander\"\nStarring: Colin Farrell, Angelina Jolie, Rosario Dawson, Val Kilmer, Christopher Plummer\nPlot: A film about the life of the Greek, Macedonian King Alexander the Great, focusing on his relationship with his mother, his conquests, and his relationships with two women.\nWhy It Works: One of the largest box office hits of 2004, “Alexander” tells the story of the life of Greek King Alexander the Great, played in the film by Colin Farrell. The movie focuses on Alexander's relationships with his mother Olympias, played by Angelina Jolie, his BFF-turned-wife Roxana, played by Rosario Dawson, as well as his battles, conquests, and the eventual downfall of his empire.\n6. \"The Bodyguard\"\nStarring: Kevin Costner, Whitney Houston\nPlot: A former Secret Service agent is hired to protect a music star from an unknown stalker.\nWhy It Works: Kevin Costner is a former Secret Service agent in \"The Bodyguard,\" hired to protect pop superstar Whitney Houston. Throughout the film, the duo falls in love while fighting off would-be assassins and overcoming their personal differences. The film was considered one of the highest grossing movies of 1992 and helped to launch Houston's acting career"}

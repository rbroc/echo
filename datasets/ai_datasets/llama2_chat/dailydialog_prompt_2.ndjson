[\/INST]","llama2_chat_completions":"  Sure, I can help you with that. Based on the prices you provided, the total cost for both of you is:\n\n£14.15 (starter and main course) + £6 (wine) + £3.50 (dessert) + £2 (coffee) = £25.65\n\nSo, the total bill for both of you is £25.65.\n\nAs for the tip, it's up to you to decide how much you would like to give. However, a common practice is to tip around 10-15% of the total bill. In this case, the tip would be:\n\n£25.65 x 10% = £2.56\n\nSo, the final total, including the tip, would be:\n\n£25.65 + £2.56 = £28.21\n\nIs that correct?"}

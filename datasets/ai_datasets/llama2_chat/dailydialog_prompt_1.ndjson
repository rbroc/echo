Yes, it's a common feature of volcanic regions like Taiwan, and it's caused by the release of hydrogen sulfide gas from the fumaroles. This gas is a byproduct of the volcanic activity and can give off a strong, unpleasant odor. But don't worry, it's completely safe and won't harm you. In fact, the sulfur smoke can be a sign of the area's geothermal activity, which is what makes Taiwan's hot springs so unique and therapeutic.
